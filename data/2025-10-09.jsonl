In this paper, we develop a unified design framework for\njoint active and passive sensing (JAPS). In particular, we consider a JAPSbased\ncooperative multi-static ISAC system for coexisting downlink (DL) and uplink\n(UL) communications. An optimization problem is formulated for maximizing the\nsum rate of both the DL and UL transmissions via jointly optimizing\nbeamforming, receive filters and power allocation, while guaranteeing the\nsensing requirements and transmission power constraints. However, the\nformulated problem is a non-convex optimization problem that is challenging to\nsolve directly due to the tight coupling among optimization variables. To\ntackle this complicated issue, we employ an efficient algorithm architecture\nleveraging alternating optimization (AO). Specifically, with the given receive\nfilters and transmission power for UL communication, the transmit beamforming\nsubproblem is addressed by successive convex approximation (SCA)-based and\npenalty-based algorithms. A fractional programming (FP)-based algorithm is\ndeveloped to tackle the receive filters and transmission power for UL\ncommunication optimization subproblem.

It is common to train deep\nlearning models for denoising using the mean-squared error (MSE) loss, which\ncorresponds to computing the posterior mean $\\mathbb{E}[x \\mid y]$. When the\nnoise is Gaussian, Tweedie's formula enables approximation of the posterior\ndistribution through its higher-order moments.
