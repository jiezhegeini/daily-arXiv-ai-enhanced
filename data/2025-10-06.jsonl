Unlike conventional single-stage VQ approaches, which require\nexponentially larger codebooks to achieve higher fidelity, the proposed\nframework decomposes the quantization process into multiple stages and\ndynamically activates both stages and individual VQ modules. This design\nenables fine-grained rate adaptation under varying bit constraints while\nmitigating computational complexity and the codebook collapse problem. To\noptimize performance, we formulate a module selection problem that minimizes\ntask loss subject to a rate constraint and solve it using an incremental\nallocation algorithm. Furthermore, we extend the framework by incorporating\nentropy coding to exploit non-uniform codeword distributions, further reducing\ncommunication overhead. Simulation results on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate\nthat the proposed framework outperforms existing digital semantic communication\nmethods, achieving superior semantic fidelity with lower complexity while\nproviding flexible and fine-grained rate control."}

To simplify the testing procedure and improve system design\nfor O-RAN systems, it is important to identify the dependencies among various\nperformance measurements, which are inherently time-series and can be modeled\nas realizations of random processes. While information theory can be utilized\nas a principled foundation for mapping these dependencies, the robust\nestimation of such measures for random processes from real-world data remains\nchallenging. This paper introduces AMIF-MDS, which employs aggregate mutual\nInformation in frequency (AMIF), a practical proxy for directed information\n(DI), to quantify similarity and visualize inter-series dependencies with\nmultidimensional scaling (MDS). The proposed quantile-based AMIF estimator is\napplied to O-RAN time-series testing data to identify dependencies among\nvarious performance measures so that we can focus on a set of ``core''\nperformance measures. Applying density-based spatial clustering of applications\nwith noise (DBSCAN) to the MDS embedding groups mutually informative metrics,\norganically reveals the link-adaptation indicators among other clusters, and\nyields a ``core'' performance measure set for future learning-driven O-RAN\ntesting."}

Denoising addresses the severe noise in raw signals\nat pilot locations, which can impair channel estimation accuracy. An\nunsupervised structure is proposed to clean field data without prior knowledge\nof pure channel information. Data augmentation is crucial due to the\ndata-intensive nature of training deep learning (DL) networks for channel state\ninformation (CSI) estimation. The network generates new channel data by\nadjusting reverse steps, enriching the training dataset. To manage varying\nsignal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in communication data, a piecewise forward\nstrategy is proposed to enhance the DDPM convergence precision. The link-level\nsimulations indicate that the proposed scheme achieves a superior tradeoff\nbetween precision and computational cost compared to existing benchmarks."}

While prior work demonstrated the\neffectiveness of NPDs on synthetic channels, this study extends the NPD to\nreal-world communication systems. The NPD was adapted to complete OFDM and\nsingle-carrier communication systems. To satisfy practical system requirements,\nthe NPD is extended to support any code length via rate matching, higher-order\nmodulations, and robustness across diverse channel conditions. The NPD operates\ndirectly on channels with memory, exploiting their structure to achieve higher\ndata rates without requiring pilots and a cyclic prefix. Although NPD entails\nhigher computational complexity than the standard 5G polar decoder, its neural\nnetwork architecture enables an efficient representation of channel statistics,\nresulting in manageable complexity suitable for practical systems. Experimental\nresults over 5G channels demonstrate that the NPD consistently outperforms the\n5G polar decoder in terms of BER, BLER, and throughput. These improvements are\nparticularly significant for low-rate and short-block configurations, which are\nprevalent in 5G control channels. Furthermore, NPDs applied to single-carrier\nsystems offer performance comparable to OFDM with lower PAPR, enabling\neffective single-carrier transmission over 5G channels.
