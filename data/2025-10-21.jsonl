MRA model, up to\na logarithmic factor in the number of patches. Moreover, for estimators based\non empirical averaging, such as the method of moments, the convergence rates\nare identical in both settings. We further establish an analogous result in two\ndimensions, where the latent structure arises from an exponentially mixing\nrandom field generated by a hard-core placement model. As a consequence, if the\nsignal in the corresponding i.i.d. MRA model is determined by moments up to\norder $n_{\\min}$, then in the low-SNR regime the number of patches required to\nestimate the signal in the MTD model scales as $\\sigma^{2n_{\\min}}$, where\n$\\sigma^2$ denotes the noise variance."}
