<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低收入和中等收入国家（LMICs）的早产儿死亡率仍然是一个严峻的挑战，持续的生命体征监测对于及早发现危及生命的状况至关重要。

Method: 提出一个集成了NeoWarm（新型生物医学设备）、NeoRoo（移动应用）和NeoSmartML（机器学习基础设施）的系统，用于在袋鼠母亲护理（KMC）期间进行全面的生命体征监测。NeoWarm设备经过功耗优化，单次充电可连续运行6-6.5天。NeoRoo移动应用采用了‘离线优先’架构，并具有高效的数据同步功能。光学字符识别（OCR）管道旨在从现有的新生儿重症监护室（NICU）监视器中自动提取生命体征数据，其F1分数在0.78-0.875之间。

Result: 实验验证表明，该系统在资源受限的环境中具有部署的可行性。OCR管道在自动提取生命体征方面表现出有希望的准确性（F1分数0.78-0.875）。NeoWarm设备的续航能力为6-6.5天。

Conclusion: 该系统在资源受限环境下监测早产儿生命体征方面显示出可行性，但仍需进一步优化心率和体温检测，以及风险分类基础模型。

Abstract: Premature infant mortality remains a critical challenge in low- and
middle-income countries (LMICs), with continuous vital sign monitoring being
essential for early detection of life-threatening conditions. This paper
presents an integrated system combining NeoWarm, a novel biomedical device,
with NeoRoo, a mobile application, and NeoSmartML, a machine learning
infrastructure, to enable comprehensive vital sign monitoring during Kangaroo
Mother Care (KMC). Our power-optimized device achieves 6-6.5 days of continuous
operation on a single charge, while the mobile application implements an
offline-first architecture with efficient data synchronization. The optical
character recognition pipeline demonstrates promising accuracy (F1 scores
0.78-0.875) for automated vital sign extraction from existing NICU monitors.
Experimental validation shows the system's feasibility for deployment in
resource-constrained settings, though further optimization of heart rate and
temperature detection, along with the risk classification foundation model is
needed.

### [2] [Distributed Gossip-GAN for Low-overhead CSI Feedback Training in FDD mMIMO-OFDM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10490)
*Yuwen Cao,Guijun Liu,Tomoaki Ohtsuki,Howard H. Yang,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 通过引入一种新颖的基于Gossip-GAN的信道状态信息（CSI）反馈训练框架，解决了传统深度自动编码器（DAE）在移动大规模多输入多输出（mMIMO）系统中存在的模型训练数据需求大、用户隐私泄露、模型灾难性遗忘等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统DAE框架在mMIMO系统中存在的信道状态信息（CSI）反馈过载、过度依赖基站收集数据导致带宽消耗和隐私泄露问题，以及在用户移动和新环境出现时模型需要重新训练而可能面临灾难性遗忘的挑战。

Method: 提出一种新颖的基于Gossip-GAN的CSI反馈训练框架。该框架利用生成对抗网络（GAN）和完全分布式的gossip学习策略，使得每个用户仅需收集少量数据即可训练GAN模型，并在低开销下完成CSI反馈训练，同时保留用户隐私。gossip学习策略有助于避免模型过拟合并加速训练。

Result: 仿真结果表明，Gossip-GAN在CSI反馈准确性方面可与中心化训练相媲美（使用真实数据集），能够有效解决移动场景下的灾难性遗忘问题，并显著减少上行链路带宽使用。此外，该方法还表现出固有的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提出的Gossip-GAN框架能够以低开销、保护用户隐私的方式实现CSI反馈训练，有效解决了传统方法在移动mMIMO系统中的诸多痛点，并在准确性、灾难性遗忘和带宽效率方面取得了良好效果。

Abstract: The deep autoencoder (DAE) framework has turned out to be efficient in
reducing the channel state information (CSI) feedback overhead in massive
multiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) systems. However, these DAE approaches
presented in prior works rely heavily on large-scale data collected through the
base station (BS) for model training, thus rendering excessive bandwidth usage
and data privacy issues, particularly for mMIMO systems. When considering
users' mobility and encountering new channel environments, the existing CSI
feedback models may often need to be retrained. Returning back to previous
environments, however, will make these models perform poorly and face the risk
of catastrophic forgetting. To solve the above challenging problems, we propose
a novel gossiping generative adversarial network (Gossip-GAN)-aided CSI
feedback training framework. Notably, Gossip-GAN enables the CSI feedback
training with low-overhead while preserving users' privacy. Specially, each
user collects a small amount of data to train a GAN model. Meanwhile, a fully
distributed gossip-learning strategy is exploited to avoid model overfitting,
and to accelerate the model training as well. Simulation results demonstrate
that Gossip-GAN can i) achieve a similar CSI feedback accuracy as centralized
training with real-world datasets, ii) address catastrophic forgetting
challenges in mobile scenarios, and iii) greatly reduce the uplink bandwidth
usage. Besides, our results show that the proposed approach possesses an
inherent robustness.

### [3] [FlowECG: Using Flow Matching to Create a More Efficient ECG Signal Generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10491)
*Vitalii Bondar,Serhii Semenov,Vira Babenko,Dmytro Holovniak*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: FlowECG是一种基于流匹配的方法，可以高效生成合成心电图，在保证生成质量的同时，大大减少了采样步数，具有临床部署的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散模型的心电图生成方法虽然质量高，但采样速度慢，限制了其在临床上的应用。

Method: FlowECG将基于扩散模型的方法中的迭代去噪过程替换为基于常微分方程的连续流动态，利用流匹配学习从噪声到数据的直接映射。

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集上，FlowECG在200次网络函数评估时，在多个评估指标上达到了与SSSD-ECG相当的性能，并且在10-25次评估时就已取得了优于基线方法的性能。

Conclusion: FlowECG通过大幅减少采样步数，实现了与扩散模型相当的合成心电图生成质量，计算效率提高了几个数量级，使其能够满足临床应用中对实时生成或大规模合成数据的需求。

Abstract: Synthetic electrocardiogram generation serves medical AI applications
requiring privacy-preserving data sharing and training dataset augmentation.
Current diffusion-based methods achieve high generation quality but require
hundreds of neural network evaluations during sampling, creating computational
bottlenecks for clinical deployment. We propose FlowECG, a flow matching
approach that adapts the SSSD-ECG architecture by replacing the iterative
diffusion process with continuous flow dynamics. Flow matching learns direct
transport paths from noise to data distributions through ordinary differential
equation solving. We evaluate our method on the PTB-XL dataset using Dynamic
Time Warping, Wasserstein distance, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and spectral
similarity metrics. FlowECG matches SSSD-ECG performance at 200 neural function
evaluations, outperforming the baseline on three metrics. The key finding shows
that FlowECG maintains generation quality with substantially fewer sampling
steps, achieving comparable results with 10-25 evaluations compared to 200 for
diffusion methods. This efficiency improvement reduces computational
requirements by an order of magnitude while preserving physiologically
realistic 12-lead ECG characteristics. The approach enables practical
deployment in resource-limited clinical settings where real-time generation or
large-scale synthetic data creation is needed.

*Chongjun Ouyang,Hao Jiang,Zhaolin Wang,Yuanwei Liu,Zhiguo Ding*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的天线系统SWAN，它使用分段波导和多个天线单元，通过三种协议（SS、SA、SM）实现高效通信。该系统解决了传统天线系统中的一些问题，并提高了信号质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的pinching-antenna系统（PASS）在多天线部署时存在相互辐射干扰问题，并且缺乏有效的信号模型。本文旨在提出一种新的天线系统架构，以解决这些问题并提高通信性能。

Method: 提出了一种分段波导使能的pinching-antenna系统（SWAN），并设计了三种操作协议：分段选择（SS）、分段聚合（SA）和分段复用（SM）。对于上行链路，提出了分段结构以消除天线间的辐射效应，并建立了多PA-PASS的信号模型，进而提出PA放置算法以最大化信噪比（SNR）。推导了三种协议下的SNR闭式表达式，并分析了扩展定律。将结果推广到下行链路，并提出了相应的PA放置方法。

Result: SWAN系统通过分段结构消除了天线间的辐射效应，建立了可行的上行信号模型，并提出了优化的PA放置算法。推导了三种协议下的SNR闭式表达式，并分析了扩展定律。数值结果表明，SM协议性能最优，SA次之，SS再次之。与传统PASS相比，SWAN系统在上行和下行链路中均能获得更高的SNR。

Conclusion: SWAN系统通过采用分段波导和PA设计，有效解决了传统PASS系统中的相互辐射干扰问题，并建立了新的信号模型。该系统能够降低PA到用户和馈源的距离，从而减小传播损耗。在三种协议中，SM协议表现最佳。与传统PASS相比，SWAN系统在上下行链路中均能显著提高SNR，证明了其优越性。

Abstract: A segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna system (SWAN) is proposed, in
which a segmented waveguide composed of multiple short dielectric waveguide
segments is employed to radiate or receive signals through the pinching
antennas (PAs) deployed on each segment. Based on this architecture, three
practical operating protocols are proposed: segment selection (SS), segment
aggregation (SA), and segment multiplexing (SM). For uplink SWAN
communications, where one PA is activated per segment, the segmented structure
eliminates the inter-antenna radiation effect, i.e., signals captured by one PA
may re-radiate through other PAs along the same waveguide. This yields a
tractable and physically consistent uplink signal model for a multi-PA
pinching-antenna system (PASS), which has not been established for conventional
PASS using a single long waveguide. Building on this model, PA placement
algorithms are proposed to maximize the uplink signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
Closed-form expressions for the received SNR under the three protocols are
derived, and the corresponding scaling laws with respect to the number of
segments are analyzed. It is proven that the segmented architecture reduces
both the average PA-to-user distance and the PA-to-feed distance, thereby
mitigating both large-scale path loss and in-waveguide propagation loss. These
results are extended to downlink SWAN communications, where multiple PAs are
activated per segment, and PA placement methods are proposed to maximize the
downlink received SNR under the three protocols. Numerical results demonstrate
that: \romannumeral1) among the three protocols, SM achieves the best
performance, followed by SA and then SS; and \romannumeral2) for all protocols,
the proposed SWAN achieves a higher SNR than conventional PASS with a single
long waveguide in both uplink and downlink scenarios.

*Minseok Kim,Masato Yomoda,Minghe Mao,Nobuaki Kuno,Koshiro Kitao,Satoshi Suyama*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本论文在154 GHz和300 GHz的室外街道峡谷环境中进行了双向信道测量，并提出了一个结合确定性与随机性成分的准确定道模型，以支持未来6G通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 100--300 GHz的亚太赫兹频段对6G移动网络至关重要，但其传播特性需要新的信道模型。

Method: 使用自研信道探测仪在室外街道峡谷环境中，于154 GHz和300 GHz下，在视距（LoS）和非视距（NLoS）条件下进行了广泛的双向信道测量。通过跨频率合并数据集进行聚类分析，识别共同和独特的路径簇，并分析其频率依赖性。最后，提出了一个结合确定性（如LoS和侧壁单次反射）和随机性成分的准确定道（QD）模型。

Result: 评估了路径损耗、延迟扩展、角度扩展和莱斯K因子等大规模参数。识别了亚太赫兹频段在城市街道峡谷中的传播特性，并确定了信道模型的参数。

Conclusion: 该研究为亚太赫兹频段在城市街道峡谷中的传播提供了宝贵的见解，为开发精确的6G系统信道模型做出了贡献。

Abstract: Sub-terahertz (sub-THz) frequencies (100--300 GHz) are expected to play a key
role in beyond-5G and 6G mobile networks. However, their quasi-optical
propagation characteristics require new channel models beyond sub-100 GHz
extrapolations. This paper presents an extensive double-directional (D-D)
channel measurement campaign conducted in an outdoor street-canyon environment
at 154 GHz and 300 GHz under both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight
(NLoS) conditions using an in-house-developed channel sounder. Based on these
measurements, clustering with merged datasets across the two frequencies
enables comparative analyses that identify both common and distinct multipath
clusters, as well as the frequency dependence of cluster-level characteristics.
A quasi-deterministic (QD) channel model is then proposed, combining
deterministic components, such as LoS and single-bounce reflections from side
walls, with random components. Large-scale parameters (path loss, delay spread,
angular spread, and Rician K-factor) are also evaluated. These results provide
valuable insights into sub-THz propagation in urban street canyons and
contribute toward the development of accurate, channel models for future 6G
systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的混合稀疏/扩散（HSD）信道模型，并设计了混合原子-最小二乘（HALS）算法来估计信道参数。该模型在理论上进行了分析，并提供了性能界限，通过仿真验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一种新的混合稀疏/扩散（HSD）信道模型，以更准确地描述信道特性。

Method: 设计了混合原子-最小二乘（HALS）算法，结合了原子和l2正则化来估计稀疏/扩散分量。对拉格朗日对偶问题进行了理论分析，并得到了约束CRLB。

Result: 通过在合成数据和真实实验数据上的仿真，验证了所提出方法的有效性，并揭示了信道特性（镜面路径的稀疏性和扩散分量的相对能量）与性能之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 所提出的HSD信道模型和HALS算法能够有效估计信道参数，并在实际应用中具有良好的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, the hybrid sparse/diffuse (HSD) channel model in frequency
domain is proposed. Based on the structural analysis on the resolvable paths
and diffuse scattering statistics in the channel, the Hybrid
Atomic-Least-Squares (HALS) algorithm is designed to estimate sparse/diffuse
components with a combined atomic and l2 regularization. A theoretical analysis
is conducted on the Lagrangian dual problem and the conditions needed to be
satisfied by primal and dual solutions are provided. This analysis, in turn,
suggests an algorithm for optimal frequency support estimation. Debiased
methods for improved channel estimation are provided. Given differing amounts
of side information, performance bounds are derived in terms of a genie-aided
estimator and constrained Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB). Numerical results via
simulations on synthetic data as well as real experimental data validate the
efficacy of the proposed method. There are clear tradeoffs with respect to the
properties of the channel with respect to performance: sparsity of specular
paths and relative energy of diffuse components.

### [7] [Self-Calibrating Integrate-and-Fire Time Encoding Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10831)
*Maya Mekel,Vered Karp,Satish Mulleti,Alejandro Cohen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型自校准积分放电时间编码机（S-IF-TEM），可在采样过程中同时进行参数估计和信号重构，有效缓解失配效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的积分放电时间编码机（IF-TEM）模型无法充分考虑设备失配和不完美性，可能导致显著的重构误差。本文旨在解决这一问题，提出一个能够处理参数未知或时变、放电时间可变以及采样器可能工作在非线性区域等实际情况的模型。

Method: 提出了一种新的实用IF-TEM（P-IF-TEM）设置，并在此基础上开发了S-IF-TEM。推导了确保完美恢复的采样率边界和重构条件，并在自校准下建立了完美重构的条件。

Result: 分析结果证明了在自校准下实现完美重构的条件。评估研究表明，与现有方法相比，该方法在信号重构方面取得了显著的改进，性能提升超过59dB。

Conclusion: 所提出的S-IF-TEM能够有效处理实际应用中的设备失配和不完美性，在参数估计和信号重构方面均表现出优越性能，显著提高了信号重构的准确性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel self-calibrating integrate-and-fire time
encoding machine (S-IF-TEM) that enables simultaneous parameter estimation and
signal reconstruction during sampling, thereby effectively mitigating mismatch
effects. The proposed framework is developed over a new practical IF-TEM
(P-IF-TEM) setting, which extends classical models by incorporating device
mismatches and imperfections that can otherwise lead to significant
reconstruction errors. Unlike existing IF-TEM settings, P-IF-TEM accounts for
scenarios where (i) system parameters are inaccurately known and may vary over
time, (ii) the integrator discharge time after firings can vary, and (iii) the
sampler may operate in its nonlinear region under large input dynamic ranges.
For this practical model, we derive sampling rate bounds and reconstruction
conditions that ensure perfect recovery. Analytical results establish the
conditions for perfect reconstruction under self-calibration, and evaluation
studies demonstrate substantial improvements - exceeding 59dB - highlighting
the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### [8] [Landscape Analysis of Simultaneous Blind Deconvolution and Phase Retrieval via Structured Low-Rank Tensor Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10834)
*Xiao Liang,Zhen Qin,Zhihui Zhu,Shuang Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于结构化低秩张量恢复的联合盲反卷积和相位恢复（BDPR）问题的几何分析方法，通过引入一个可处理的张量感知模型作为替代，研究了其优化景观和收敛性，并得到了理论和数值实验的支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于BDPR问题相关的优化景观复杂且难以直接分析，因此需要引入一个可处理的替代模型来研究其优化特性。

Method: 首先，研究了替代的张量感知问题的总体优化景观，并证明了黎曼梯度下降（RGD）在温和条件下可实现线性收敛。然后，将分析扩展到张量感知问题本身，建立了局部几何特性，证明了RGD的收敛保证，并量化了其在测量噪声下的鲁棒性。

Result: 研究表明，替代的张量感知模型的黎曼梯度下降具有良好的收敛性和鲁棒性，这为解决原始BDPR问题提供了理论指导。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决BDPR问题提供了基础性的理论见解，重点在于通过结构化低秩张量恢复框架来理解和优化问题。

Abstract: This paper presents a geometric analysis of the simultaneous blind
deconvolution and phase retrieval (BDPR) problem via a structured low-rank
tensor recovery framework. Due to the highly complicated structure of the
associated sensing tensor, directly characterizing its optimization landscape
is intractable. To address this, we introduce a tensor sensing problem as a
tractable surrogate that preserves the essential structural features of the
target low-rank tensor while enabling rigorous theoretical analysis. As a first
step toward understanding this surrogate model, we study the corresponding
population risk, which captures key aspects of the underlying low-rank tensor
structure. We characterize the global landscape of the population risk on the
unit sphere and show that Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) converges linearly
under mild conditions. We then extend the analysis to the tensor sensing
problem, establishing local geometric properties, proving convergence
guarantees for RGD, and quantifying robustness under measurement noise. Our
theoretical results are further supported by extensive numerical experiments.
These findings offer foundational insights into the optimization landscape of
the structured low-rank tensor recovery problem, which equivalently
characterizes the original BDPR problem, thereby providing principled guidance
for solving the original BDPR problem.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在线的最优体积约束分解（MVCU）方法，通过仅在必要时更新分解，大大提高了计算效率，同时保持了与离线方法相当的估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了克服现有 MVCU 算法在处理在线数据时的可扩展性限制，该论文旨在提出一种能够逐个处理观测值的在线方法。

Method: 该方法的核心思想是仅在必要时更新 MVCU 的解，并通过在线检查相应的优化问题约束来指导更新。它只存储和处理那些对于 SSMF 底层几何约束有信息量的观测值。

Result: 该方法在处理合成和真实数据集时，实现了与所依赖的离线 MVCU 方法相当的估计精度，同时显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的在线 MVCU 方法能够有效处理大规模在线数据，并在计算效率和估计精度之间取得了良好的平衡。

Abstract: Simplex-structured matrix factorization (SSMF) is a common task encountered
in signal processing and machine learning. Minimum-volume constrained unmixing
(MVCU) algorithms are among the most widely used methods to perform this task.
While MVCU algorithms generally perform well in an offline setting, their
direct application to online scenarios suffers from scalability limitations due
to memory and computational demands. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes an approach which can build upon any off-the-shelf MVCU algorithm to
operate sequentially, i.e., to handle one observation at a time. The key idea
of the proposed method consists in updating the solution of MVCU only when
necessary, guided by an online check of the corresponding optimization problem
constraints. It only stores and processes observations identified as
informative with respect to the geometrical constraints underlying SSMF. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach when analyzing synthetic and real
datasets, showing that it achieves estimation accuracy comparable to the
offline MVCU method upon which it relies, while significantly reducing the
computational cost.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 使用基于Transformer的模型预测下一代低地球轨道（LEO）卫星网络中的用户流量需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测LEO卫星网络的下一代用户流量需求，以实现高粒度动态波束跳变。

Method: 提出使用基于Transformer、具有概率稀疏自注意力机制的预训练概率时间序列模型，并将其与FARIMA模型进行比较。

Result: 在某些流量条件下，基于Transformer的解决方案的预测准确性提高了多达6%，以均方误差作为性能指标。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的解决方案在预测LEO卫星网络用户流量需求方面优于FARIMA模型。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the use of a transformer-based model to address the
need for forecasting user traffic demand in the next generation Low Earth Orbit
(LEO) satellite networks. Considering a LEO satellite constellation, we present
the need to forecast the demand for the satellites in-orbit to utilize dynamic
beam-hopping in high granularity. We adopt a traffic dataset with second-order
self-similar characteristics. Given this traffic dataset, the Fractional
Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (FARIMA) model is considered a
benchmark forecasting solution. However, the constrained on-board processing
capabilities of LEO satellites, combined with the need to fit a new model for
each input sequence due to the nature of FARIMA, motivate the investigation of
alternative solutions. As an alternative, a pretrained probabilistic time
series model that utilizes transformers with a Prob-Sparse self-attention
mechanism is considered. The considered solution is investigated under
different time granularities with varying sequence and prediction lengths.
Concluding this paper, we provide extensive simulation results where the
transformer-based solution achieved up to six percent better forecasting
accuracy on certain traffic conditions using mean squared error as the
performance indicator.

Abstract: This work presents a first-of-its-kind graphical user interface (GUI)-based
simulator developed using MATLAB App designer for the comprehensive analysis of
sparse linear arrays (SLAs) in the difference coarray (DCA) domain. Sparse
sensor arrays have emerged as a critical solution in enhancing signal
detection, direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, and beamforming in fields
such as wireless communication, radar, sonar, and integrated sensing systems.
They offer several advantages over traditional uniform arrays, including
reduced system complexity, lower deployment costs, and improved mitigation of
mutual coupling effects. The tool enables users to input array configurations,
compute DCAs, visualize weight function graphs, and assess the hole-free status
of arrays, as applicable for coarray processing. Unlike conventional simulators
that focus on radiation pattern visualization (array pattern, main lobe and
sidelobe characteristics, azimuth cut, rectangular view, polar view etc.), this
tool addresses the behavior of SLAs from a coarray domain perspective.
Numerical validations demonstrate the tool's correctness, effectiveness, and
its potential to foster further research in sparse arrays. This simulator could
also be used as a teaching aid to drive home complicated topics and attract
young minds towards the fascinating field of sparse array design.

*Haoyu Wang,Jiawei Hu,Jiaqi Xu,Ying Ju,A. Lee Swindlehurst*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: RIS技术在提升无线通信性能的同时，也引入了新的安全漏洞。本文研究了在时分双工模式下，使用非互易RIS（NR-RIS）模型的多天线无线系统中信道互易性攻击（CRACK）的威胁。CRACK可以通过扭曲下行链路预编码来降低通信速率并促进被动窃听，而无需额外的信号传输或信道状态信息（CSI）。与传统的RIS干扰策略不同，NR-RIS不需要与合法系统同步，因此可以采用慢速或固定配置来实现CRACK，模糊了直连信道和RIS诱导信道的区别，从而增加了相应防御性预编码设计的复杂性。为了应对NR-RIS带来的CRACK威胁，我们开发了“SecureCoder”，一个基于深度强化学习的框架，可以通过估计的上行链路CSI和用户的速率反馈来缓解CRACK并确定改进的下行链路预编码矩阵。模拟结果证明了NR-RIS CRACK造成的严重性能下降，并验证了SecureCoder在提高吞吐量和降低安全威胁方面的有效性，从而增强了系统鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology enhances wireless
communication performance, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities that can
be exploited by adversaries. This paper investigates channel reciprocity attack
(CRACK) threats in multi-antenna wireless systems operating in time-division
duplexing mode using a physically consistent non-reciprocal RIS (NR-RIS) model.
CRACK can degrade communication rate and facilitate passive eavesdropping
behavior by distorting the downlink precoding, without requiring any additional
signal transmission or channel state information (CSI). Unlike conventional RIS
jamming strategies, the NR-RIS does not need synchronization with the
legitimate system and thus can operate with slow or fixed configurations to
implement CRACK, obscuring the distinction between the direct and RIS-induced
channels and thereby complicating corresponding defensive precoding designs. To
counter the CRACK threat posed by NR-RIS, we develop ``SecureCoder,'' a deep
reinforcement learning-based framework that can mitigate CRACK and determine an
improved downlink precoder matrix using the estimated uplink CSI and rate
feedback from the users. Simulation results demonstrate the severe performance
degradation caused by NR-RIS CRACK and validate the effectiveness of
SecureCoder in improving both throughput and reducing security threats, thereby
enhancing system robustness.

Conclusion: HIS提供了一种新的无线通信架构范式，可以更具成本效益地实现高性能和高效率的平衡。

Abstract: Revolutionizing communication architectures to achieve a balance between
enhanced performance and improved efficiency is becoming increasingly critical
for wireless communications as the era of ultra-large-scale arrays approaches.
In traditional communication architectures, radio frequency (RF) signals are
typically converted to baseband for subsequent processing through operations
such as filtering, analog-to-digital conversion and down-conversion, all of
which depend on expensive and power-intensive RF chains. The increased hardware
complexity and escalated power consumption resulting from this dependency
significantly limit the practical deployment of ultra-large-scale arrays. To
address these limitations, we propose a holographic communication system based
on the principle of interferometry, designated as holographic interference
surfaces (HIS). Utilizing the interference effect of electromagnetic waves, HIS
estimates the channel state information (CSI) by dealing solely with power
information, which enables the replacement of RF chains with power sensors and
completes the signal processing in radio frequency. As proof-of-concept
demonstrations, we implemented a prototype system based on principles of
holographic interference. Experimental results align well with theoretical
predictions, confirming the practical viability and effectiveness of the
proposed HIS. This work provides a new paradigm for building a more
cost-effective wireless communication architecture.

Abstract: Wireless image transmission underpins diverse networked intelligent services
and becomes an increasingly critical issue. Existing works have shown that deep
learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) is an effective framework to
balance image transmission fidelity and data overhead. However, these studies
oversimplify the communication system as a mere pipeline with noise, failing to
account for the complex dynamics of wireless channels and concrete
physical-layer transmission process. To address these limitations, we propose a
Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-empowered Dynamic Channel Adaptive Transmission
(DCAT) scheme, designed for practical implementation in real communication
scenarios. Building upon the Swin Transformer backbone, our DCAT scheme
demonstrates robust adaptability to time-selective fading and channel aging
effects by effectively utilizing the physical-layer transmission
characteristics of wireless channels. Comprehensive experimental results
confirm that DCAT consistently achieves superior performance compared with JSCC
baseline approaches across all conditions. Furthermore, our neural network
architecture demonstrates high scalability due to its interpretable design,
offering substantial potential for cost-efficient deployment in practical
applications.

Abstract: In this paper, a Resistor Hopping (RH) scheme with the addition of biases is
proposed for secure Kirchhoff Law Johnson-Noise (KLJN) communication. The RH
approach enables us to increase the bit rate of secure communication between
Alice and Bob, while also ensuring that the inherent unconditional security of
KLJN is satisfied. The biases are added to the proposed scheme to better
distinguish between Gaussian distributed noises in terms of their means, rather
than just using variances. Throughout the paper, we strive to minimize biases
to achieve a power-efficient scheme. For the detection part of the proposed
algorithm, a Maximum-Likelihood (ML) detector is derived. The separability
condition of Gaussian distributions is investigated, along with the provision
of a threshold-based detector that offers both simple and optimal thresholds in
terms of minimizing the error probability. Some analysis of the proposed
RH-KLJN communication scheme is provided, including Physical Layer Security
(PLS) equations. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed
scheme over the classical KLJN scheme, offering a higher data rate and lower
bit error probability at the expense of increased complexity.

Abstract: This letter generalizes noise modulation by introducing two voltage biases
and employing non-Gaussian noise distributions, such as Mixture of Gaussian
(MoG) and Laplacian, in addition to traditional Gaussian noise. The proposed
framework doubles the data rate by enabling discrimination in both the mean and
variance of transmitted noise symbols. This novel modulation scheme is referred
to as Generalized Quadratic Noise Modulation (GQNM). Closed-form expressions
for the Bit Error Probability (BEP) are derived for the Generalized Gaussian

demonstrate the advantages of the generalized modulation scheme, particularly
under non-Gaussian noise assumptions, highlighting its potential for enhanced
performance in low-power and secure communication systems.

Abstract: Recovering signals from low-order moments is a fundamental yet notoriously
difficult task in inverse problems. This recovery process often reduces to
solving ill-conditioned systems of polynomial equations. In this work, we
propose a new framework that integrates score-based diffusion priors with
moment-based estimators to regularize and solve these nonlinear inverse
problems. This introduces a new role for generative models: stabilizing
polynomial recovery from noisy statistical features. As a concrete application,
we study the multi-target detection (MTD) model in the high-noise regime. We
demonstrate two main results: (i) diffusion priors substantially improve
recovery from third-order moments, and (ii) they make the super-resolution MTD
problem, otherwise ill-posed, feasible. Numerical experiments on MNIST data
confirm consistent gains in reconstruction accuracy across SNR levels. Our
results suggest a promising new direction for combining generative priors with
nonlinear polynomial inverse problems.

Abstract: Infrastructure-mounted sensors can capture rich environmental information to
enhance communications and facilitate beamforming in millimeter-wave systems.
This work presents an efficient sensing-assisted long-term beam tracking
framework that selects optimal beams from a codebook for current and multiple
future time slots. We first design a large attention-enhanced neural network
(NN) to fully exploit past visual observations for beam tracking. A
convolutional NN extracts compact image features, while gated recurrent units
with attention capture the temporal dependencies within sequences. The large NN
then acts as the teacher to guide the training of a lightweight student NN via
knowledge distillation. The student requires shorter input sequences yet
preserves long-term beam prediction ability. Numerical results demonstrate that
the teacher achieves Top-5 accuracies exceeding 93% for current and six future
time slots, approaching state-of-the-art performance with a 90% complexity
reduction. The student closely matches the teacher's performance while cutting
complexity by another 90%, despite operating with 60% shorter input sequences.
This improvement significantly enhances data efficiency, reduces latency, and
lowers power consumption in sensing and processing.

Abstract: Motivated by the constant modulus property of frequency shift keying (FSK)
based waveforms and the stabilisation of its radar performance with an increase
in the number of subpulses, in this paper an FSK-based dynamic subpulse number
joint communications and radar waveform design is proposed. From a
communications point of view, the system operates based on traditional FSK
modulation. From a sensing point of view, although the subpulses are
continuously generated and transmitted, radar waveforms are dynamically formed
by monitoring the flatness of the spectrum which in turn guarantees the
accuracy of the delay estimation. Other constraints on the waveform length are
used to ensure satisfactory values of the root mean square time duration,
ambiguity function sidelobe levels and prevent overly long waveforms. To
provide an estimation of the probability of generating extremely long
waveforms, the distribution of the number of subpulses is approximated using a
Brownian motion process and an existing result on its one-sided exit density.
Numerical examples are provided to evaluate the accuracy of the approximate
distribution, as well as the ambiguity function sidelobe levels and the delay
and Doppler shift estimation performance of the transmitted waveforms.

Abstract: In this project, we wanted to discover an analog topology that could
effectively convert amplitude-modulated (AM) signals to frequency-modulated
(FM) signals, while also ensuring that both sets of signals were within their
respective radio frequency (RF) bands. To that end, an effective topology for
doing so was developed, characterized, and demonstrated, requiring the ability
to de-modulate incoming signals from the AM radio band--spanning from 530 kHz
to 1700 kHz--and re-modulate these signals into the FM radio band--spanning
from 88 MHz to 108 MHz. These bands are separated by roughly 86 MHz, presenting
the need for the topology to radically alter the incoming frequency before
re-broadcasting. At its simplest implementation, this required an AM
demodulation circuit coupled to a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO).
Together, these two circuits translated variations in the incoming envelope
signal to variations in the output frequency while still maintaining
high-fidelity audio, similar to how existing radio receiving and broadcasting
are done. Altogether, the project not only developed a working system but also
provided valuable instruction in the design, analysis, and construction of
effective RF circuits--invaluable to future endeavors within analog
electronics.

Abstract: Cooperative reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are promising
technologies for 6G networks to support a great number of users. Compared with
the fixed RISs, the properly deployed RISs may improve the communication
performance with less communication energy consumption, thereby improving the
energy efficiency. In this paper, we consider a cooperative unmanned aerial
vehicle-mounted RISs (UAV-RISs)-assisted cellular network, where multiple RISs
are carried and enhanced by UAVs to serve multiple ground users (GUs)
simultaneously such that achieving the three-dimensional (3D) mobility and
opportunistic deployment. Specifically, we formulate an energy-efficient
communication problem based on multi-objective optimization framework
(EEComm-MOF) to jointly consider the beamforming vector of base station (BS),
the location deployment and the discrete phase shifts of UAV-RIS system so as
to simultaneously maximize the minimum available rate over all GUs, maximize
the total available rate of all GUs, and minimize the total energy consumption
of the system, while the transmit power constraint of BS is considered. To
comprehensively solve EEComm-MOF which is an NP-hard and non-convex problem
with constraints, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II with a
continuous solution processing mechanism, a discrete solution processing
mechanism, and a complex solution processing mechanism (INSGA-II-CDC) is
proposed. Simulations results demonstrate that the proposed INSGA-II-CDC can
solve EEComm-MOF effectively and outperforms other benchmarks under different
parameter settings. Moreover, the stability of INSGA-II-CDC and the
effectiveness of the improved mechanisms are verified. Finally, the
implementability analysis of the algorithm is given.

Abstract: A systematic approach for high-speed via transition design is proposed. The

for selecting parameter values are provided and validated by correlating 3D
full-wave FEM simulation results with actual measurements of the coupon board.
When a sufficient number of stitching vias are used, the via structure can be
approximated as a coaxial transmission line. The proposed methodology builds on
this approximation and also considers high-order modes. With this framework,
engineers can easily optimize design parameters while intuitively understanding
how geometry affects bandwidth. This approach also allows engineers with
limited access to expensive and computationally intensive 3D FEM tools to
design high bandwidth vias up to 67 GHz.

Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) and dual-polarized SIM (DPSIM) enabled
wave-domain signal processing have emerged as promising research directions for
offloading baseband digital processing tasks and efficiently simplifying
transceiver design. However, existing architectures are limited to employing
SIM (DPSIM) for a single communication function, such as precoding or
combining. To further enhance the overall performance of SIM (DPSIM)-assisted
systems and achieve end-to-end (E2E) joint optimization from the transmitted
bitstream to the received bitstream, we propose an SIM (DPSIM)- assisted E2E
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, where traditional
communication tasks such as modulation, precoding, combining, and demodulation
are performed simultaneously during electromagnetic (EM) forward propagation.
Furthermore, inspired by the idea of abstracting real metasurfaces as hidden
layers of a neural network, we propose the electromagnetic neural network
(EMNN) to enable the control of the E2E OFDM communication system. In addition,
transfer learning is introduced into the model training, and a training and
deployment framework for the EMNN is designed. Simulation results demonstrate
that both SIM-assisted E2E OFDM systems and DPSIM-assisted E2E OFDM systems can
achieve robust bitstream transmission under complex channel conditions. Our
study highlights the application potential of EMNN and SIM (DPSIM)-assisted E2E
OFDM systems in the design of next-generation transceivers.

Abstract: A radio map captures the spatial distribution of wireless channel parameters,
such as the strength of the signal received, across a geographic area. The
problem of fine-grained three-dimensional (3D) radio map estimation involves
inferring a high-resolution radio map for the two-dimensional (2D) area at an
arbitrary target height within a 3D region of interest, using radio samples
collected by sensors sparsely distributed in that 3D region. Solutions to the
problem are crucial for efficient spectrum management in 3D spaces,
particularly for drones in the rapidly developing low-altitude economy.
However, this problem is challenging due to ultra-sparse sampling, where the
number of collected radio samples is far fewer than the desired resolution of
the radio map to be estimated. In this paper, we design a Large Artificial
Intelligence Model (LAM) called RadioLAM for the problem. RadioLAM employs the
creative power and the strong generalization capability of LAM to address the
ultra-sparse sampling challenge. It consists of three key blocks: 1) an
augmentation block, using the radio propagation model to project the radio
samples collected at different heights to the 2D area at the target height; 2)
a generation block, leveraging an LAM under an Mixture of Experts (MoE)
architecture to generate a candidate set of fine-grained radio maps for the
target 2D area; and 3) an election block, utilizing the radio propagation model
as a guide to find the best map from the candidate set. Extensive simulations
show that RadioLAM is able to solve the fine-grained 3D radio map estimation
problem efficiently from an ultra-low sampling rate of 0.1%, and significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: The rapid development of the low-altitude economy has imposed unprecedented

and facilitate intelligent services in dynamic airspace environments. However,
unlocking its full potential in practical applications presents significant
challenges. Traditional aerial systems predominantly focus on air-ground
communication services, often neglecting the integration of sensing,
computation, control, and energy-delivering functions, which hinders the
ability to meet diverse mission-critical demands. Besides, the absence of
systematic low-altitude airspace planning and management exacerbates issues
regarding dynamic interference in three-dimensional space, coverage
instability, and scalability. To overcome these challenges, a comprehensive
framework, termed low-altitude wireless network (LAWN), has emerged to
seamlessly integrate communication, sensing, computation, control, and air
traffic management into a unified design. This article provides a comprehensive
overview of LAWN systems, introducing LAWN system fundamentals and the
evolution of functional designs. Subsequently, we delve into performance
evaluation metrics and review critical concerns surrounding privacy and
security in the open-air network environment. Finally, we present the
cutting-edge developments in airspace structuring and air traffic management,
providing insights to facilitate the practical deployment of LAWNs.

Abstract: Ray tracing (RT) simulations require accurate transmitter (TX) and receiver
(RX) location information from real-world measurements to accurately
characterize wireless propagation behavior in an environment. Such wireless
propagation measurements typically employ GPS-based logging for TX/RX
locations, which can produce meter-level errors that lead to unreliable RT
calibration and validation. These location misalignments cause inaccurate
interactions between RT-generated multipath components (MPCs) and the modeled
3D environment, which lead to erroneous channel predictions, and severe
discrepancies between simulated and measured power delay profiles (PDPs) and
channel characteristics. Moreover, the same RT-generated PDPs using inaccurate
locations result in calibration errors when adjusting material properties such
as conductivity and permittivity.
  This paper presents a systematic multi-stage TX/RX location calibration
framework to correct location errors and consequently align measured and
simulated omnidirectional PDPs.
  Optimization is performed using a computationally efficient multi-stage grid
search and the Powell method. Applying the location calibration framework to
NYU WIRELESS urban-microcell (UMi) measurements at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz
corrected TX/RX location errors of up to 7 m. The framework reduced the
composite loss function by 42.3\% for line-of-sight (LOS) and 13.5\% for
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Furthermore, peak power prediction accuracy
improved by approximately 1 dB on average. Such improved geometric alignment
enables accurate channel prediction, vital for beam management and
infrastructure deployment for next-generation wireless networks.

Abstract: The selection of nodes that can serve as cluster heads, local sinks and

formulating the problem as a convex relaxation of the NP-hard set cover

simulations across various graph models and dynamic conditions, it is shown
that the method achieves faster execution times (lower complexity) and
competitive sparsity compared to classical greedy and genetic algorithms (GA),
offering a robust, distributed, and cost-efficient node selection solution.

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have recently emerged as a promising solution for
sixth-generation (6G) ultra-dense connectivity. These systems utilize dynamic
radiating and/or shaping techniques to mitigate interference and improve
spectral efficiency without relying on channel state information (CSI). The
reported improvements achieved by employing a single dynamically activated
radiating position in fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) are significant. To
fully realize the potential of FAMA in multi-user multiplexing, we propose
leveraging the unique fast-switching capabilities of a single radio-frequency
(RF)-chain meta-fluid antenna structure to achieve multi-activation. This
allows for a significantly larger set of independent radiating states without
requiring additional signal processing. Simulations demonstrate that
multi-activation FAMA enables robust multi-user multiplexing with a higher
signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) under various Rayleigh-fading environments
compared to other single RF-chain technologies. We further show that the SIR
can be optimized within a 15~$\mu s$ timeframe under a multi-user
Rayleigh-fading channel, making the proposed scheme highly suitable for
fast-changing wireless environments. Verified through the theoretical Jakes'
model, full three-dimensional (3D) electromagnetic (EM) simulations and
experimental validation, multi-activation FAMA enables effective CSI-free,
multi-user communication, offering a scalable solution for high-capacity
wireless networks.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
their capacities to capture universal knowledge, making them promising
general-purpose optimization solvers for wireless signal processing. Motivated
by these findings, we take the first step towards fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs
for the effective analysis of radar signal features in marine target detection
tasks. Nevertheless, directly fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on marine target
detection tasks tends to suffer from pronounced overfitting, particularly in
challenging low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) scenarios. This overfitting
primarily stems from the model's tendency to memorize spurious or noisy feature
patterns rather than learning discriminative structures that generalize well to
unseen data. To address this challenge, we introduce RadarLLM, a novel
fine-tuning framework that utilizes an effective preference-aware loss. Unlike
conventional training strategies that uniformly optimize all feature tokens,
this loss function selectively optimizes different feature patches based on
their online evaluated learning values, thus guiding the model to focus on the
most generalizable patterns during optimization. We theoretically demonstrate
the effectiveness of the evaluated learning values by transforming the problem
as selecting useful feature tokens. Extensive experiments on real-world marine
radar datasets show that 1) the proposed loss function is much better than the
original one, with particularly significant gains in challenging low SCR
scenarios and 2) RadarLLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
across diverse detection scenarios, with particularly notable gains under
limited training data conditions.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods are widely used to extract high-dimensional
patterns from the sequence features of radar echo signals. However,
conventional DL algorithms face challenges such as redundant feature segments,
and constraints from restricted model sizes. To address these issues, we
propose a framework that integrates feature preprocessing with large language
models (LLMs). Our preprocessing module tokenizes radar sequence features,
applies a patch selection algorithm to filter out uninformative segments, and
projects the selected patches into embeddings compatible with the feature space
of pre-trained LLMs. Leveraging these refined embeddings, we incorporate a
pre-trained LLM, fine-tuning only the normalization layers to reduce training
burdens while enhancing performance. Experiments on measured datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines on supervised learning tests.
