Muller", "Brani Vidakovic"], "title": "A Multiscale Approach for Enhancing Weak Signal Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Stochastic resonance (SR), a phenomenon originally introduced in climate\nmodeling, enhances signal detection by leveraging optimal noise levels within\nnon-linear systems. Traditional SR techniques, mainly based on single-threshold\ndetectors, are limited to signals whose behavior does not depend on time. Often\nlarge amounts of noise are needed to detect weak signals, which can distort\ncomplex signal characteristics. To address these limitations, this study\nexplores multi-threshold systems and the application of SR in multiscale\napplications using wavelet transforms. In the multiscale domain signals can be\nanalyzed at different levels of resolution to better understand the underlying\ndynamics.\n  We propose a double-threshold detection system that integrates two\nsingle-threshold detectors to enhance weak signal detection. We evaluate it\nboth in the original data domain and in the multiscale domain using simulated\nand real-world signals and compare its performance with existing methods.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that, in the original data domain, the\nproposed double-threshold detector significantly improves weak signal detection\ncompared to conventional single-threshold approaches. Its performance is\nfurther improved in the frequency domain, requiring lower noise levels while\noutperforming existing detection systems. This study advances SR-based\ndetection methodologies by introducing a robust approach to weak signal\nidentification, with potential applications in various disciplines."}

Larsson"], "title": "Is Repeater-Assisted Massive MIMO Compatible with Dynamic TDD?", "comment": "Submitted to 2026 IEEE ICASSP", "summary": "We present a framework for joint amplification and phase shift optimization\nof the repeater gain in dynamic time-division duplex (TDD) repeater-assisted\nmassive MIMO networks. Repeaters, being active scatterers with amplification\nand phase shift, enhance the received signal strengths for users. However, they\ninevitably also amplify undesired noise and interference signals, which become\nparticularly prominent in dynamic TDD systems due to the concurrent downlink\n(DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions, introducing cross-link interference among\naccess points and users operating in opposite transmit directions. This causes\na non-trivial trade-off between amplification of desired and undesired signals.\nTo underpin the conditions under which such a trade-off can improve\nperformance, we first derive DL and UL spectral efficiencies (SEs), and then\ndevelop a repeater gain optimization algorithm for SE maximization.\nNumerically, we show that our proposed algorithm successfully calibrates the\nrepeater gain to amplify the desired signal while limiting the interference."}

However, its amplitude-controlled holographic\nbeamforming suffers from directional fluctuations, making it difficult to fully\nexploit the spatial gain of RHS. Fortunately, the promising 6D movable antenna\n(6DMA) provides a potential solution to this problem. In this paper, we study a\n6D movable holographic surface (6DMHS) integrated data and energy transfer\n(IDET) system, where a three-stage protocol is proposed, consisting of an\nuplink sensing stage, an orientation adjustment stage and a downlink\ntransmission stage, to coordinate the 6DMHS and effectively serve the IDET\nreceivers. Firstly, the holographic-based sensing technology is proposed and\nthe sensing information of the IDET receivers is exploited. Secondly, by fixing\nthe rotations with the sensing information, the orientation optimization\nproblem is formulated for designing the holographic beamforming of the RHS and\nadjusting the translations of the 6DMHS. As a result, the directions with\nmaximum beamforming gain are aligned with each IDET receiver. Thirdly, by\nfixing the orientation of the 6DMHS and the holographic beamforming, the\nequivalent wireless channel is obtained. The IDET performance optimization\nproblem is formulated for obtaining the optimal digital beamforming, power\nsplitting factor and energy harvesting (EH) power. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of improving the IDET\nperformance compared to the benchmarks."}
