This work rejects that premise. It\nproposes that survival is not an externally annotated target but a geometric\nconsequence: an emergent property of the curvature and flow inherent in\nbiological state space. We develop a theory of Self-Organizing Survival\nManifolds (SOSM), in which survival-relevant dynamics arise from low-curvature\ngeodesic flows on latent manifolds shaped by internal biological constraints. A\nsurvival energy functional based on geodesic curvature minimization is\nintroduced and shown to induce structures where prognosis aligns with geometric\nflow stability.

This paper introduces a\nCUDA-accelerated computational framework for simulating Pasur, emphasizing\nefficient memory management. We use our framework to compute near-Nash\nequilibria via Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), a well-known algorithm\nfor solving large imperfect-information games.\n  Solving Pasur presents unique challenges due to its intricate rules and the\nlarge size of its game tree. We handle rule complexity using PyTorch CUDA\ntensors and to address the memory-intensive nature of the game, we decompose\nthe game tree into two key components: (1) actual game states, and (2)\ninherited scores from previous rounds. We construct the Full Game Tree by\npairing card states with accumulated scores in the Unfolding Process. This\ndesign reduces memory overhead by storing only essential strategy values and\nnode connections. To further manage computational complexity, we apply a\nround-by-round backward training strategy, starting from the final round and\nrecursively propagating average utilities to earlier stages. Our approach\nconstructs the complete game tree, which on average consists of over $10^9$\nnodes. We provide detailed implementation snippets.\n  After computing a near-Nash equilibrium strategy, we train a tree-based model\nto predict these strategies for use during gameplay. We then estimate the fair\nvalue of each deck through large-scale self-play between equilibrium strategies\nby simulating, for instance, 10,000 games per matchup, executed in parallel\nusing GPU acceleration.\n  Similar frameworks can be extended to other reinforcement learning algorithms\nwhere the action tree naturally decomposes into multiple rounds such as\nturn-based strategy games or sequential trading decisions in financial markets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528CUDA\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u6a21\u62dfPasur\u724c\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u5927\u5316\u5229\u7528\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u6c42\u89e3\u8fd1\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6e38\u620f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Pasur\u6e38\u620f\u590d\u6742\u7684\u73a9\u6cd5\u548c\u5e9e\u5927\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528PyTorch CUDA\u5f20\u91cf\u7ba1\u7406\u89c4\u5219\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u6e38\u620f\u6811\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u8f6e\u9006\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u542b\u8d8510^9\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6e38\u620f\u6811\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fa\u8fd1\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86GPU\u52a0\u901f\u6a21\u62df\u53ca\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6781\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u591a\u8f6e\u6218\u672f\u548c\u5e8f\u8d2f\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However,\ntraditional GNNs primarily focus on adjacency relationships between nodes,\noften overlooking the rich role-based characteristics that are crucial for\nlearning more expressive node representations. Existing methods for capturing\nrole-based features are largely unsupervised and fail to achieve optimal\nperformance in downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel hypergraph neural network with state space model (HGMN) that effectively\nintegrates role-aware representations into GNNs and the state space model.

Additionally, the inclusion of hypergraph convolution\nlayers enables the model to capture complex dependencies within hypergraph\nstructures. To mitigate the over-smoothing problem inherent in deep GNNs, we\nincorporate a residual network, ensuring improved stability and better feature\npropagation across layers. Extensive experiments conducted on one newly\nintroduced dataset and four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nHGMN. The model achieves significant performance improvements on node\nclassification tasks compared to state-of-the-art GNN methods.

A Deep Dive into Whole vs. Individual Modalities", "comment": null, "summary": "Multimodal recommendation (MMRec) has emerged as a mainstream paradigm,\ntypically leveraging text and visual embeddings extracted from pre-trained\nmodels such as Sentence-BERT, Vision Transformers, and ResNet. This approach is\nfounded on the intuitive assumption that incorporating multimodal embeddings\ncan enhance recommendation performance. However, despite its popularity, this\nassumption lacks comprehensive empirical verification. This presents a critical\nresearch gap. To address it, we pose the central research question of this\npaper: Are multimodal embeddings truly beneficial for recommendation? To answer\nthis question, we conduct a large-scale empirical study examining the role of\ntext and visual embeddings in modern MMRec models, both as a whole and\nindividually. Specifically, we pose two key research questions: (1) Do\nmultimodal embeddings as a whole improve recommendation performance? (2) Is\neach individual modality - text and image - useful when used alone? To isolate\nthe effect of individual modalities - text or visual - we employ a modality\nknockout strategy by setting the corresponding embeddings to either constant\nvalues or random noise. To ensure the scale and comprehensiveness of our study,\nwe evaluate 14 widely used state-of-the-art MMRec models. Our findings reveal\nthat: (1) multimodal embeddings generally enhance recommendation performance -\nparticularly when integrated through more sophisticated graph-based fusion\nmodels. Surprisingly, commonly adopted baseline models with simple fusion\nschemes, such as VBPR and BM3, show only limited gains. (2) The text modality\nalone achieves performance comparable to the full multimodal setting in most\ncases, whereas the image modality alone does not.

While\ntraditional recommendation approaches primarily rely on ID-based\nrepresentations or item-side content features, they often fall short in\ncapturing the underlying semantics aligned with user preferences (e.g.,\nrecommendation reasons for items), leading to a semantic-collaborative gap.\nRecently emerged LLM-based feature extraction approaches also face a key\nchallenge: how to ensure that LLMs possess recommendation-aligned reasoning\ncapabilities and can generate accurate, personalized reasons to mitigate the\nsemantic-collaborative gap. To address these issues, we propose a novel Content\nUnderstanding from a Collaborative Perspective framework (CURec), which\ngenerates collaborative-aligned content features for more comprehensive\nrecommendations. \\method first aligns the LLM with recommendation objectives\nthrough pretraining, equipping it with instruction-following and\nchain-of-thought reasoning capabilities. Next, we design a reward model\ninspired by traditional recommendation architectures to evaluate the quality of\nthe recommendation reasons generated by the LLM.

However, they are\nvulnerable to tampering attacks which can efficiently elicit harmful behaviors\nby modifying weights or activations. Currently, there is not yet a robust\nscience of open-weight model risk management. Existing safety fine-tuning\nmethods and other post-training techniques have struggled to make LLMs\nresistant to more than a few dozen steps of adversarial fine-tuning. In this\npaper, we investigate whether filtering text about dual-use topics from\ntraining data can prevent unwanted capabilities and serve as a more\ntamper-resistant safeguard. We introduce a multi-stage pipeline for scalable\ndata filtering and show that it offers a tractable and effective method for\nminimizing biothreat proxy knowledge in LLMs. We pretrain multiple\n6.9B-parameter models from scratch and find that they exhibit substantial\nresistance to adversarial fine-tuning attacks on up to 10,000 steps and 300M\ntokens of biothreat-related text -- outperforming existing post-training\nbaselines by over an order of magnitude -- with no observed degradation to\nunrelated capabilities.

Traditionally, this\nprocess depends on manually designed nonlinear transformations (e.g.,\npolynomial or exponential functions) and hand-tuned fusion weights to balance\ncompeting goals -- an approach that is labor-intensive and frequently\nsuboptimal in achieving Pareto efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel\nUnified Monotonic Ranking Ensemble (UMRE) framework to address the limitations\nof traditional methods in ensemble sorting. UMRE replaces handcrafted\ntransformations with Unconstrained Monotonic Neural Networks (UMNN), which\nlearn expressive, strictly monotonic functions through the integration of\npositive neural integrals.

Effective\nand efficient analysis of their oral history archives can promote access and\nunderstanding of the oral histories. However, Large-scale analysis of these\narchives remains limited due to their unstructured format, emotional\ncomplexity, and high annotation costs. This paper presents a scalable framework\nto automate semantic and sentiment annotation for Japanese American\nIncarceration Oral History. Using LLMs, we construct a high-quality dataset,\nevaluate multiple models, and test prompt engineering strategies in\nhistorically sensitive contexts. Our multiphase approach combines expert\nannotation, prompt design, and LLM evaluation with ChatGPT, Llama, and Qwen. We\nlabeled 558 sentences from 15 narrators for sentiment and semantic\nclassification, then evaluated zero-shot, few-shot, and RAG strategies. For\nsemantic classification, ChatGPT achieved the highest F1 score (88.71%),\nfollowed by Llama (84.99%) and Qwen (83.72%). For sentiment analysis, Llama\nslightly outperformed Qwen (82.66%) and ChatGPT (82.29%), with all models\nshowing comparable results. The best prompt configurations were used to\nannotate 92,191 sentences from 1,002 interviews in the JAIOH collection. Our\nfindings show that LLMs can effectively perform semantic and sentiment\nannotation across large oral history collections when guided by well-designed\nprompts. This study provides a reusable annotation pipeline and practical\nguidance for applying LLMs in culturally sensitive archival analysis.

The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for\nmechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of\nindividual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as\nneural networks.\n  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively\nencode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of\ntwo Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that\ncan be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR). The corresponding USM\ncoordinates can be used to compute a Chebyshev distance metric as well as k-mer\nfrequencies, without having to recompute the embedded numeric coordinates, and,\nparadoxically, allowing for non-integers values of k.\n  Results: This report advances the bijective fractal encoding by Universal\nSequence Maps (USM) by resolving seeding biases affecting the iterated process.\nThe resolution had two results, the first expected, the second an intriguing\noutcome: 1) full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity;\nand 2) uncovering the nature of USM as an efficient numeric process converging\ntowards a steady state sequence embedding solution.

To support the\ngeneration of such feedback, we introduce an annotation framework that models\neach error's error type and generalizability. For error type classification, we\nintroduce a typology focused on inferring learners' knowledge gaps by\nconnecting their errors to specific grammatical patterns.

However, current forecasting systems remain heavily reliant on\nmanual expert interpretation, introducing subjectivity and significant\noperational burdens. With the rapid development of AI technologies, the\nend-to-end \"AI weather station\" is gradually emerging as a new trend in\npredicting severe weather events.

To address these challenges, we introduce MP-Bench, the\nfirst large-scale temporal multimodal dataset for severe weather events\nprediction, comprising 421,363 pairs of raw multi-year meteorological data and\ncorresponding text caption, covering a wide range of severe weather scenarios\nacross China.

Our HeteRo-Select method uses a clear,\nstep-by-step scoring system that considers client usefulness, fairness, update\nspeed, and data variety.

Despite the ever-improving capabilities\nof large language models (LLMs), effectively integrating persona fidelity in\nconversations remains challenging due to the limited diversity in existing\ndialogue data. We propose a novel framework SBS (Score-Before-Speaking), which\noutperforms previous methods and yields improvements for both million and\nbillion-parameter models. Unlike previous methods, SBS unifies the learning of\nresponses and their relative quality into a single step. The key innovation is\nto train a dialogue model to correlate augmented responses with a quality score\nduring training and then leverage this knowledge at inference. We use\nnoun-based substitution for augmentation and semantic similarity-based scores\nas a proxy for response quality.

There is, however, scientific consensus\nthat AI systems can reflect and exacerbate societal biases, raising concerns\nabout identity-based harm when used in critical social contexts. Prior work has\nlaid a solid foundation for assessing bias in LLMs by evaluating demographic\ndisparities in different language reasoning tasks. In this work, we extend\nsingle-axis fairness evaluations to examine intersectional bias, recognizing\nthat when multiple axes of discrimination intersect, they create distinct\npatterns of disadvantage. We create a new benchmark called WinoIdentity by\naugmenting the WinoBias dataset with 25 demographic markers across 10\nattributes, including age, nationality, and race, intersected with binary\ngender, yielding 245,700 prompts to evaluate 50 distinct bias patterns.\nFocusing on harms of omission due to underrepresentation, we investigate bias\nthrough the lens of uncertainty and propose a group (un)fairness metric called\nCoreference Confidence Disparity which measures whether models are more or less\nconfident for some intersectional identities than others.

We examine this issue in\nmulti-task reinforcement learning (MTRL), where higher representational\nflexibility is crucial for managing diverse and potentially conflicting task\ndemands. We systematically explore how sparsification methods, particularly\nGradual Magnitude Pruning (GMP) and Sparse Evolutionary Training (SET), enhance\nplasticity and consequently improve performance in MTRL agents.

To support\ndiverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools\nwithin a unified reasoning loop.

It approximates the update of a\npretrained weight matrix $W\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ by the product of two\nlow-rank matrices, $BA$, where $A \\in\\mathbb{R}^{r\\times n}$ and\n$B\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times r} (r\\ll\\min\\{m,n\\})$. Increasing the dimension $r$\ncan raise the rank of LoRA weights (i.e., $BA$), which typically improves\nfine-tuning performance but also significantly increases the number of\ntrainable parameters. In this paper, we propose Block Diversified Low-Rank\nAdaptation (BoRA), which improves the rank of LoRA weights with a small number\nof additional parameters. Specifically, BoRA treats the product $BA$ as a block\nmatrix multiplication, where $A$ and $B$ are partitioned into $b$ blocks along\nthe columns and rows, respectively (i.e., $A=[A_1,\\dots,A_b]$ and\n$B=[B_1,\\dots,B_b]^\\top$). Consequently, the product $BA$ becomes the\nconcatenation of the block products $B_iA_j$ for $i,j\\in[b]$. To enhance the\ndiversity of different block products, BoRA introduces a unique diagonal matrix\n$\\Sigma_{i,j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r\\times r}$ for each block multiplication,\nresulting in $B_i \\Sigma_{i,j} A_j$. By leveraging these block-wise diagonal\nmatrices, BoRA increases the rank of LoRA weights by a factor of $b$ while only\nrequiring $b^2r$ additional parameters.

We propose a trajectory-location\ndual-tower architecture, with a location tower for universal spatial encoding\nand a trajectory tower for sequential mobility modeling.

Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the\nsemantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several\ntime slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission\nto acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being\neavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming\nsignals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic\ninformation. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for\nsemantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not\ncommunicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit\npower of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic\ninformation transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power\nto maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of\nthe user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted\ntwin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine\nthe transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot\nwithout the communications between the server and the jammer. Compared to\nstandard reinforcement learning methods, the propose method uses an additional\nQ network to estimate Q values such that the agent can select the action with a\nlower Q value from the two Q networks thus avoiding local optimal action\nselection and estimation bias of Q values. Simulation results show that the\nproposed algorithm can improve the privacy and the semantic information\ntransmission quality by up to 77.8% and 14.3% compared to the traditional\nreinforcement learning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u9690\u79d8\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u4f18\u5148\u91c7\u6837\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u53cc\u8fdf\u6ede\u6df1\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u201d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u786e\u4fdd\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f20\u8f93\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4f18\u5148\u91c7\u6837\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u53cc\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u5c06\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u8f93\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u522b\u8fbe77.8%\u548c14.3%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79d8\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, modeling this progression\nremains challenging due to 1) the scarcity of longitudinal data obtained\nthrough irregular and infrequent subject visits and 2) the complex interplay of\npathological mechanisms across brain regions and disease stages, where\ntraditional models assume fixed mechanisms throughout disease progression. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel stage-aware Mixture of Experts\n(MoE) framework that explicitly models how different contributing mechanisms\ndominate at different disease stages through time-dependent expert\nweighting.Data-wise, we utilize an iterative dual optimization method to\nproperly estimate the temporal position of individual observations,\nconstructing a co hort-level progression trajectory from irregular snapshots.\nModel-wise, we enhance the spatial component with an inhomogeneous graph neural\ndiffusion model (IGND) that allows diffusivity to vary based on node states and\ntime, providing more flexible representations of brain networks. We also\nintroduce a localized neural reaction module to capture complex dynamics beyond\nstandard processes.The resulting IGND-MoE model dynamically integrates these\ncomponents across temporal states, offering a principled way to understand how\nstage-specific pathological mechanisms contribute to progression.

While RL\ndrives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025)\nshows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it\nmerely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a\nquestion: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior\nto develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a\nGRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a\nstudent model with the guidance from a teacher model.

Each piece of feedback\nreshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct\nsolution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through\nfeedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning\ncapabilities of the student model. In particular, on average, our method shows\na 3.85% improvement over zero-shot baselines across benchmarks, and on\nMATH-500, AIME and GPQA-Diamond it shows 2.08%, 2.23% and 3.99% improvements\nover the vanilla-GRPO baseline.

Crucially, this two-stage approach\nis powered by an initial circuit localization phase that identifies and targets\nthe specific internal components responsible for encoding the conflicting fact.\nThrough a rigorous experimental methodology on\nmicrosoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, we demonstrate that this mechanistically\ninformed two-stage approach achieves near-perfect accuracy (98.50%) for the\nnew, modulated fact while simultaneously effectively suppressing the original\nconflicting fact (96.00% forget rate).

These functional connectivity\ndynamics may be related to behaviour and neuropsychiatric disease. To model\nthese dynamics, temporal brain connectivity representations are essential, as\nthey reflect evolving interactions between brain regions and provide insight\ninto transient neural states and network reconfigurations. However,\nconventional graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture long-range\ntemporal dependencies in dynamic fMRI data. To address this challenge, we\npropose BrainATCL, an unsupervised, nonparametric framework for adaptive\ntemporal brain connectivity learning, enabling functional link prediction and\nage estimation. Our method dynamically adjusts the lookback window for each\nsnapshot based on the rate of newly added edges. Graph sequences are\nsubsequently encoded using a GINE-Mamba2 backbone to learn spatial-temporal\nrepresentations of dynamic functional connectivity in resting-state fMRI data\nof 1,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project.

Quality Estimation (QE) for Machine\nTranslation (MT), which assesses the quality of a source-target pair without\nrelying on reference translations, remains a challenging cross-lingual task for\nLLMs. The challenges stem from the inherent limitations of existing LLM-based\nQE systems, which are pre-trained for causal language modelling rather than\nregression-specific tasks, further elevated by the presence of low-resource\nlanguages given pre-training data distribution. This paper introduces ALOPE, an\nadaptive layer-optimization framework designed to enhance LLM-based QE by\nrestructuring Transformer representations through layer-wise adaptation for\nimproved regression-based prediction. Our framework integrates low-rank\nadapters (LoRA) with regression task heads, leveraging selected pre-trained\nTransformer layers for improved cross-lingual alignment.

The method abstracts system states at different time slices into a\nsequence of graph structures. It integrates the runtime features of service\nnodes with the invocation relationships among services to construct a unified\nspatiotemporal modeling framework. The model first applies a graph\nconvolutional network to extract high-order dependency information from the\nservice topology. Then it uses a gated recurrent network to capture the dynamic\nevolution of performance metrics over time. A time encoding mechanism is also\nintroduced to enhance the model's ability to represent non-stationary temporal\nsequences. The architecture is trained in an end-to-end manner, optimizing the\nmulti-layer nested structure to achieve high-precision regression of future\nservice performance metrics. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod, a large-scale public cluster dataset is used. A series of\nmulti-dimensional experiments are designed, including variations in time\nwindows and concurrent load levels. These experiments comprehensively evaluate\nthe model's predictive performance and stability.

We\nintroduce ThemeClouds, an open-source visualization tool that uses large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to generate thematic, participant-weighted word clouds\nfrom dialogue transcripts. The system prompts an LLM to identify concept-level\nthemes across a corpus and then counts how many unique participants mention\neach topic, yielding a visualization grounded in breadth of mention rather than\nraw term frequency. Researchers can customize prompts and visualization\nparameters, providing transparency and control. Using interviews from a user\nstudy comparing five recording-device configurations (31 participants; 155\ntranscripts, Whisper ASR), our approach surfaces more actionable device\nconcerns than frequency clouds and topic-modeling baselines (e.g., LDA,\nBERTopic).

Prior work has shown that ICL emerges in transformers due to\nthe presence of special circuits called induction heads. Given the equivalence\nbetween induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling\nsequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of\nmodel depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can\nefficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart\ncannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large. However, for higher\norder Markov sources, the best known constructions require at least three\nlayers (each with a single attention head) - leaving open the question: can a\ntwo-layer single-head transformer represent any kth-order Markov process? In\nthis paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer\ntransformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional\nk-gram.

To address this challenge, this study proposes an\nopen-world information fusion method, termed Full Negation Belief\nTransformation (FNBT), based on the Dempster-Shafer theory.

Finally, a full negation mechanism is\nemployed to transform the mass functions, so that existing combination rules\ncan be applied to the transformed mass functions for such information fusion.\nTheoretically, the proposed method satisfies three desirable properties, which\nare formally proven: mass function invariance, heritability, and essential\nconflict elimination.

This study is the first to reveal that\nstrategically embedded persuasive language can bias LLM judges when scoring\nmathematical reasoning tasks, where correctness should be independent of\nstylistic variation. Grounded in Aristotle's rhetorical principles, we\nformalize seven persuasion techniques (Majority, Consistency, Flattery,\nReciprocity, Pity, Authority, Identity) and embed them into otherwise identical\nresponses.

To this end, we evaluate both\nindividual LLMs and multi-agent approaches across three highly specialized\ndomains: finance, biomedicine, and law. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent\ndiscussion framework to simulate a group of human annotators, where LLMs are\ntasked to engage in discussions by considering others' annotations and\njustifications before finalizing their labels.

The Mixture\nof Experts (MoE) architecture enhances model capacity through sparse\nactivation, but faces two major difficulties in practical deployment: (1) The\npresence of numerous outliers in activation distributions leads to severe\ndegradation in quantization accuracy for both activations and weights,\nsignificantly impairing inference performance; (2) Under limited memory,\nefficient offloading and collaborative inference of expert modules struggle to\nbalance latency and throughput. To address these issues, this paper proposes an\nefficient MoE edge deployment scheme based on Hessian-Aware Quantization (HAQ)\nand CPU-GPU collaborative inference.

Recent advances in LLMs show promising potential in\nreducing the expert workload. However, evaluating the quality of automatically\ngenerated scientific writing is a crucial open issue, as it requires knowledge\nof domain-specific evaluation criteria and the ability to discern expert\npreferences. Conventional automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge systems are\ninsufficient to grasp expert preferences and domain-specific quality standards.\nTo address this gap and support human-AI collaborative writing, we focus on\nrelated work generation, one of the most challenging scientific tasks, as an\nexemplar. We propose GREP, a multi-turn evaluation framework that integrates\nclassical related work evaluation criteria with expert-specific preferences.\nInstead of assigning a single score, our framework decomposes the evaluation\ninto fine-grained dimensions. This localized evaluation approach is further\naugmented with contrastive few-shot examples to provide detailed contextual\nguidance for the evaluation dimensions. The design principles allow our\nframework to deliver cardinal assessment of quality, which can facilitate\nbetter post-training compared to ordinal preference data.

However, to address the\nchallenge of learning effective features from a sparse reward signal, recent\ntrends have shifted towards adding complex auxiliary objectives or fully\ndecoupling the two processes, often at the cost of increased design complexity.\nThis work proposes an alternative to both decoupling and naive end-to-end\nlearning, arguing that performance can be significantly improved by structuring\nthe interaction between distinct perception and control networks with a\nprincipled, game-theoretic dynamic. We formalize this dynamic by introducing\nthe Stackelberg Coupled Representation and Reinforcement Learning (SCORER)\nframework, which models the interaction between perception and control as a\nStackelberg game. The perception network (leader) strategically learns features\nto benefit the control network (follower), whose own objective is to minimize\nits Bellman error. We approximate the game's equilibrium with a practical\ntwo-timescale algorithm. Applied to standard DQN variants on benchmark tasks,\nSCORER improves sample efficiency and final performance.

To enforce\nnorms of academic integrity and ensure students' learning, learning analytics\nmethods to automatically detect LLM-generated text appear increasingly\nappealing. This paper benchmarks the performance of different state-of-the-art\ndetectors in educational contexts, introducing a novel dataset, called\nGenerative Essay Detection in Education (GEDE), containing over 900\nstudent-written essays and over 12,500 LLM-generated essays from various\ndomains. To capture the diversity of LLM usage practices in generating text, we\npropose the concept of contribution levels, representing students' contribution\nto a given assignment. These levels range from purely human-written texts, to\nslightly LLM-improved versions, to fully LLM-generated texts, and finally to\nactive attacks on the detector by \"humanizing\" generated texts.

While many spatio-temporal methods\nfocus on improving accuracy, fairness has recently gained attention due to\ngrowing evidence that biased predictions in spatio-temporal applications can\ndisproportionately disadvantage certain demographic or geographic groups,\nthereby reinforcing existing socioeconomic inequalities and undermining the\nethical deployment of AI in public services. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework, FairDRL-ST, based on disentangled representation learning, to\naddress fairness concerns in spatio-temporal prediction, with a particular\nfocus on mobility demand forecasting.

However, despite recent progress, studies\nshow that SLMs often struggle to generalize across datasets, even for trained\nlanguages and tasks, raising concerns about whether they process speech in a\ntext-like manner as intended. A key challenge underlying this limitation is the\nmodality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in\nspeech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by\nexploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization.\nTo mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization\n(OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport\nproblem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each\ntraining iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between\nspeech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,\nthen incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to\noptimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with\ntranscript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or\nlearnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training\nprocedures.

Second, it ranks these candidates against test queries to\nselect the most relevant and non-redundant demonstrations. Evaluated on three\nbiomedical NLP tasks (named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction (RE),\nand text classification (TC)) using LLaMA 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 for inference, along\nwith three retrievers (BGE-Large, BMRetriever, MedCPT), Dual-Div consistently\noutperforms baselines-achieving up to 5% higher macro-F1 scores-while\ndemonstrating robustness to prompt permutations and class imbalance. Our\nfindings establish that diversity in initial retrieval is more critical than\nranking-stage optimization, and limiting demonstrations to 3-5 examples\nmaximizes performance efficiency."}

This thesis investigates how\nuncertainty estimation can enhance the safety and trustworthiness of ML,\nfocusing on selective prediction -- where models abstain when confidence is\nlow.\n  We first show that a model's training trajectory contains rich uncertainty\nsignals that can be exploited without altering its architecture or loss. By\nensembling predictions from intermediate checkpoints, we propose a lightweight,\npost-hoc abstention method that works across tasks, avoids the cost of deep\nensembles, and achieves state-of-the-art selective prediction performance.\nCrucially, this approach is fully compatible with differential privacy (DP),\nallowing us to study how privacy noise affects uncertainty quality. We find\nthat while many methods degrade under DP, our trajectory-based approach remains\nrobust, and we introduce a framework for isolating the privacy-uncertainty\ntrade-off. Next, we then develop a finite-sample decomposition of the selective\nclassification gap -- the deviation from the oracle accuracy-coverage curve --\nidentifying five interpretable error sources and clarifying which interventions\ncan close the gap. This explains why calibration alone cannot fix ranking\nerrors, motivating methods that improve uncertainty ordering. Finally, we show\nthat uncertainty signals can be adversarially manipulated to hide errors or\ndeny service while maintaining high accuracy, and we design defenses combining\ncalibration audits with verifiable inference.\n  Together, these contributions advance reliable ML by improving, evaluating,\nand safeguarding uncertainty estimation, enabling models that not only make\naccurate predictions -- but also know when to say \"I do not know\".", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u6539\u5584\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u64cd\u63a7\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5b9e\u73b0\u540e\u9a8c\u5f03\u6743\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u5f71\u54cd\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9519\u8bef\u6e90\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u64cd\u63a7\u53ca\u9632\u5fa1\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e0e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u8bef\u5dee\u6e90\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u76f8\u5e94\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6821\u51c6\u5ba1\u67e5\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u6211\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Although there are already many\nexcellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are\nstill many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to\nincomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth\nanalysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow\nfrom data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long\nCoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies\nfor each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that a\nsmall number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large\nnumber of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better\nresults without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues\nwith current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical\nexploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories.

The\nfaithfulness issue undermines the reliability and practical utility of\nattribution explanations. We argue that these concerns stem from three core\nchallenges. First, difficulties arise in comparing attribution methods due to\ntheir unstructured heterogeneity, differences in heuristics, formulations, and\nimplementations that lack a unified organization. Second, most methods lack\nsolid theoretical underpinnings, with their rationales remaining absent,\nambiguous, or unverified. Third, empirically evaluating faithfulness is\nchallenging without ground truth. Recent theoretical advances provide a\npromising way to tackle these challenges, attracting increasing attention.

While\ncollecting fine-grained, aspect-specific preference data is more reliable and\nscalable, existing methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle\nwith the severe noise and conflicts inherent in such aggregated datasets. In\nthis paper, we tackle this challenge from a data-centric perspective. We first\nderive the Direct Multi-Preference Optimization (DMPO) objective, and uncover a\nkey Preference Divergence (PD) term that quantifies inter-aspect preference\nconflicts. Instead of using this term for direct optimization, we leverage it\nto formulate a novel, theoretically-grounded data selection principle. Our\nprinciple advocates for selecting a subset of high-consensus data-identified by\nthe most negative PD values-for efficient DPO training. We prove the optimality\nof this strategy by analyzing the loss bounds of the DMPO objective in the\nselection problem. To operationalize our approach, we introduce practical\nmethods of PD term estimation and length bias mitigation, thereby proposing our\nPD selection method. Evaluation on the UltraFeedback dataset with three varying\nconflict levels shows that our simple yet effective strategy achieves over 10%\nrelative improvement against both the standard holistic preference and a\nstronger oracle using aggregated preference signals, all while boosting\ntraining efficiency and obviating the need for intractable holistic preference\nannotating, unlocking the potential of robust LLM alignment via fine-grained\npreference signals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u591a\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u4e0b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u504f\u597d\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u7b26\u5408\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u504f\u597d\u504f\u5dee\uff08PD\uff09\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728UltraFeedback\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc710%\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u597d\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6602\u8d35\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u504f\u597d\u504f\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u597d\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a socially-aware privacy-preserving FL\nmechanism that systematically quantifies indirect privacy leakage through a\nmulti-hop propagation model. We formulate the server-client interaction as a\ntwo-stage Stackelberg game, where the server, as the leader, optimizes\nincentive policies, and clients, as followers, strategically select their\nprivacy budgets, which determine their privacy-preserving levels by controlling\nthe magnitude of added noise. To mitigate information asymmetry in networked\nprivacy estimation, we introduce a mean-field estimator to approximate the\naverage external privacy risk. We theoretically prove the existence and\nconvergence of the fixed point of the mean-field estimator and derive\nclosed-form expressions for the Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium.

Recent studies have leveraged the\ngeneralization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time\nseries forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies\nfocus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic\nmodality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data\npatterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue,\nwe propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent\nperiodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the\nsemantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the\ninterpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs\nfor temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel\nat capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term\nanomalies in time-series data.

To address these\nlimits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote\nReinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents\nexchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two\nunits: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the\nenvironment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs\nactions to maximize a reward signal.

To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Level Routing Grouped\nMixture-of-Experts (TRGE) method.

With the number of experts continually grows\nin this process, TRGE maintains the static experts count within the group and\nintroduces the intra-group router to alleviate routing overfitting caused by\nthe increasing routing complexity.

Data-driven\nTSE leverages historical sensing data and employs statistical models or machine\nlearning methods to infer traffic state. Model-data dual-driven traffic state\nestimation attempts to harness the strengths of both aspects to achieve more\naccurate TSE. From the perspective of mathematical operator theory, TSE can be\nviewed as a type of operator that maps available measurements of inerested\ntraffic state into unmeasured traffic state variables in real time. For the\nfirst time this paper proposes to study real-time freeway TSE in the idea of\nphysics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet), which is an\noperator-oriented architecture embedding traffic flow models based on deep\nneural networks. The paper has developed an extended architecture from the\noriginal PI-DeepONet.

However, the rapid influx of state-of-the-art research,\ninconsistent data representation, and the complexity of optimizing circuit\ndesign objectives make this task significantly challenging. In this paper, we\npropose MuaLLM, an open-source multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) agent for\ncircuit design assistance that integrates a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) framework with an adaptive vector database of circuit design\nresearch papers. Unlike conventional LLMs, the MuaLLM agent employs a Reason +\nAct (ReAct) workflow for iterative reasoning, goal-setting, and multi-step\ninformation retrieval. It functions as a question-answering design assistant,\ncapable of interpreting complex queries and providing reasoned responses\ngrounded in circuit literature. Its multimodal capabilities enable processing\nof both textual and visual data, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive\nanalysis. The system dynamically adapts using intelligent search tools,\nautomated document retrieval from the internet, and real-time database updates.\nUnlike conventional approaches constrained by model context limits, MuaLLM\ndecouples retrieval from inference, enabling scalable reasoning over\narbitrarily large corpora. At the maximum context length supported by standard\nLLMs, MuaLLM remains up to 10x less costly and 1.6x faster while maintaining\nthe same accuracy. This allows rapid, no-human-in-the-loop database generation,\novercoming the bottleneck of simulation-based dataset creation for circuits. To\nevaluate MuaLLM, we introduce two custom datasets: RAG-250, targeting retrieval\nand citation performance, and Reasoning-100 (Reas-100), focused on multistep\nreasoning in circuit design.

Generalisable Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) thus hold promise for\nadapting these interventions across individuals. However, inter-subject\nvariability in EEG signals, further compounded by movement-induced artefacts\nand motor planning differences, hinders the generalisability of BCIs and\nresults in lengthy calibration processes. We propose Individual Tangent Space\nAlignment (ITSA), a novel pre-alignment strategy incorporating subject-specific\nrecentering, distribution matching, and supervised rotational alignment to\nenhance cross-subject generalisation. Our hybrid architecture fuses Regularised\nCommon Spatial Patterns (RCSP) with Riemannian geometry in parallel and\nsequential configurations, improving class separability while maintaining the\ngeometric structure of covariance matrices for robust statistical computation.\nUsing leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, `ITSA' demonstrates significant\nperformance improvements across subjects and conditions. The parallel fusion\napproach shows the greatest enhancement over its sequential counterpart, with\nrobust performance maintained across varying data conditions and electrode\nconfigurations.

However, understandings of the underlying mechanisms by which\nthey acquire these abilities through training remain limited, particularly from\na theoretical standpoint. This work investigates how transformers learn to\nsolve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought\nprocesses, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks:\na backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to\nthe root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements\ntwo-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then\nreversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis,\ngrounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer\ntransformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to\nunseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward\nreasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and\ncoordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive\npath. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained\ntransformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures. Moreover, they\noffer insights into the emergence of reasoning abilities, suggesting that when\ntasks are structured to take intermediate chain-of-thought steps, even shallow\nmulti-head transformers can effectively solve problems that would otherwise\nrequire deeper architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u7684\u5355\u5c42\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5728\u6811\u8def\u5f84\u67e5\u627e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u81ea\u4e3b\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u83b7\u5f97\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u6811\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u7684\u5355\u5c42\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8def\u5f84\u67e5\u627e\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u5355\u5c42\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u8def\u5f84\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4e13\u7cbe\u548c\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6d45\u5c42\u591a\u5934\u7ed3\u6784\u4e5f\u80fd\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}
