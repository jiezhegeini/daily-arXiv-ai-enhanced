As a promising solution, physical layer security (PLS) technology leverages the inherent characteristics of wireless channels to provide security assurance. Particularly, stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) directly manipulates electromagnetic waves through their multilayer structures, offering significant potential for enhancing PLS performance in an energy efficient manner. Thus, in this work, we investigate an SIM-assisted secure communication system for MUs under the threat of an eavesdropper, addressing practical challenges such as channel uncertainty in mobile environments, multiple MU interference, and residual hardware impairments. Consequently, we formulate a joint power and phase shift optimization problem (JPPSOP), aiming at maximizing the achievable secrecy rate (ASR) of all MUs. Given the non-convexity and dynamic nature of this optimization problem, we propose an enhanced proximal policy optimization algorithm with a bidirectional long short-term memory mechanism, an off-policy data utilization mechanism, and a policy feedback mechanism (PPO-BOP). Through these mechanisms, the proposed algorithm can effectively capture short-term channel fading and long-term MU mobility, improve sample utilization efficiency, and enhance exploration capabilities. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that PPO-BOP significantly outperforms benchmark strategies and other deep reinforcement learning algorithms in terms of ASR.10.1109/TWC.2026.3658332"}

Most existing methods operate at the window level, facing a trade-off between temporal resolution and decoding accuracy. Recent work has shown that hidden Markov model (HMM)-based post-processing can smooth window-level decoder outputs to improve this trade-off. Instead of using a separate smoothing step, we propose to integrate the decoding and smoothing components into a single probabilistic framework using a Markov switching model (MSM). It directly models the relationship between the EEG and speech envelopes under each attention state while incorporating the temporal dynamics of attention. This formulation enables sample-level attention decoding, with model parameters and attention states jointly estimated via the expectation-maximization algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated MSM formulation achieves comparable decoding accuracy to HMM post-processing while providing faster attention switch detection.

High-field ($\\geq$3T) systems are standard, and require technical trade-offs, including artifacts in the EEG signal, reduced compatibility with metallic implants, high acoustic noise, and artifacts around high-susceptibility areas such as the optic nerve and nasal sinus. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneous EEG-fMRI at 0.55T in a visual task. We characterize the gradient and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts inherent to this environment and observe reduced BCG magnitude consistent with the expected scaling of pulse-related artifacts with static magnetic field strength.

Furthermore, we tested a multimodal integration pipeline and demonstrated that the EEG power envelope corresponds with the hemodynamic BOLD response, supporting the potential to measure neurovascular coupling in this environment. We demonstrate that combined EEG-fMRI at 0.55T is feasible and represents a promising environment for multimodal neuroimaging."}

Helmholtz as the foundation for a theory of \\emph{musical tones}. The second one, which is described by Fourier's double integral, became the basis for treating certain kinds of infinity in discontinuous functions, as shown by A. De Morgan in his 1842 \\emph{The Differential and Integral Calculus}. Both make up the fundamental basis for what is now commonly known as the \\emph{Fourier theorem}. With the help of P. A. M.

We propose DopplerGLRTNet, an amortized off-grid GLRT: a lightweight regressor predicts the continuous Doppler within a resolution cell from the whitened observation, and the detector outputs a single GLRT/NMF-like score given by the normalized matched-filter energy at the predicted Doppler. Monte Carlo simulations in Gaussian and compound-Gaussian clutter show that DopplerGLRTNet mitigates off-grid saturation, approaches dense-scan performance at a fraction of its cost, and improves robustness to covariance estimation at the same empirically calibrated Pfa."}

However, the large XL-IRS aperture induces spherical wavefront propagation due to near-field (NF) effects, complicating cascaded channel estimation. Conventional dictionary-based methods suffer from cumulative quantization errors and high complexity, especially in uniform planar array (UPA) systems. To address these issues, we first propose a tensor modelization method for NF cascaded channels by exploiting the tensor product among the horizontal and vertical response vectors of the UPA-structured base station (BS) and the incident-reflective array response vector of the IRS. This structure leverages spatial characteristics, enabling independent estimation of factor matrices to improve efficiency. Meanwhile, to avoid quantization errors, we propose an off-grid cascaded channel estimation framework based on sparse Tucker decomposition. Specifically, we model the received signal as a Tucker tensor, where the sparse core tensor captures path gain-delay terms and three factor matrices are spanned by BS and NF IRS array responses. We then formulate a sparse core tensor minimization problem with tri-modal log-sum sparsity constraints to tackle the NP-hard challenge. Finally, the method is accelerated via higher-order singular value decomposition preprocessing, combined with majorization-minimization and a tailored tensor over-relaxation fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding technique. We derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound and conduct convergence analysis. Simulations show the proposed scheme achieves a 13.6 dB improvement in normalized mean square error over benchmarks with significantly reduced runtime."}

This paper proposes a lightweight, non-visual image-based method for robust quasi-static human presence detection using a low-cost 60 GHz FMCW radar. On a dataset covering five semi-static activities, the proposed method improves average detection accuracy from 68.3% for Cell-Averaging CFAR (CA-CFAR) and 78.8% for Order-Statistics CFAR (OS-CFAR) to 93.24% for Subject 1, from 51.3%, 68.3% to 92.3% for Subject 2, and 57.72%, 69.94% to 94.82% for Subject 3, respectively. Finally, we benchmarked all three detectors across all activities on a Raspberry Pi 4B using a shared Range-Angle (RA) preprocessing pipeline. The proposed algorithm obtains an average 8.2 ms per frame, resulting in over 120 frames per second (FPS) and a 74 times speed-up over OS-CFAR.

This paper revisits its sensing potential and presents WiRSSI, a bistatic WiFi sensing framework for passive human tracking using only RSSI measurements. WiRSSI adopts a 1Tx-3Rx configuration and is readily extensible to Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) deployments. We first reveal how CSI power implicitly encodes phase-related information and how this relationship carries over to RSSI, showing that RSSI preserves exploitable Doppler, Angle-of-Arrival (AoA), and delay cues associated with human motion. WiRSSI then extracts Doppler-AoA features via a 2D Fast Fourier Transform and infers delay from amplitude-only information in the absence of subcarrier-level phase. The estimated AoA and delay are then mapped to Cartesian coordinates and denoised to recover motion trajectories. Experiments in practical environments show that WiRSSI achieves median XY localization errors of 0.905 m, 0.784 m, and 0.785 m for elliptical, linear, and rectangular trajectories, respectively. In comparison, a representative CSI-based method attains median errors of 0.574 m, 0.599 m, and 0.514 m, corresponding to an average accuracy gap of 0.26 m. These results demonstrate that, despite its lower resolution, RSSI can support practical passive sensing and offers a low-cost alternative to CSI-based WiFi sensing."}

Among these approaches, vector quantization (VQ)-based JSCC effectively maps high-dimensional semantic feature vectors into compact codeword indices for digital modulation. However, existing methods, including universal JSCC (uJSCC), rely on fixed, modulation-specific encoders, decoders, and codebooks, limiting adaptability to fine-grained SNR variations. We propose an extended universal JSCC (euJSCC) framework that achieves SNR- and modulation-adaptive transmission within a single model. euJSCC employs a hypernetwork-based normalization layer for fine-grained feature vector normalization and a dynamic codebook generation (DCG) network that refines modulation-specific base codebooks according to block-wise SNR. To handle block fading channels, which consist of multiple coherence blocks, an inner-outer encoder-decoder architecture is adopted, where the outer encoder and decoder capture long-term channel statistics, and the inner encoder and decoder refine feature vectors to align with block-wise codebooks. A two-phase training strategy, i.e., pretraining on AWGN channels followed by finetuning on block fading channels, ensures stable convergence. Experiments on image transmission demonstrate that euJSCC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art channel-adaptive digital JSCC schemes under both block fading and AWGN channels."}

This curvature breaks the Fourier/Vandermonde structure behind classical subspace methods, and it is especially limiting with hybrid front-ends that provide only a small number of pilot measurements. Consequently, practical systems need continuous angle resolution and joint angle-range inference where many near-field approaches still rely on costly 2D gridding. We show that convexity can meet curvature via a lifted, gridless superresolution framework for near-field measurements. The key is a Bessel-Vandermonde factorization of the Fresnel-phase manifold that exposes a hidden Vandermonde structure in angle while isolating the range dependence into a compact coefficient map. Building on this, we introduce a lifting that maps each range bin and continuous angle to a structured rank-one atom, converting the nonlinear near-field model into a linear inverse problem over a row-sparse matrix. Recovery is posed as atomic-norm minimization and an explicit dual characterization via bounded trigonometric polynomials yields certificate-based localization that super-resolves off-grid angles and identifies active range bins. Simulations with strongly undersampled hybrid observations validate reliable joint angle-range recovery for next-generation wireless and ISAC systems."}

The relevance of this question spans from hybrid-MIMO analog combiners via computational meta-imagers to programmable wave-domain signal processing. Yet, no electromagnetically consistent bounds have been derived for the fidelity with which a desired operator can be realized in a real-world reconfigurable wave system. Here, we derive such bounds based on an electromagnetically consistent multiport-network model (capturing mutual coupling between tunable elements) and accounting for real-world hardware constraints (lossy, 1-bit-programmable elements). Specifically, we formulate the operator-synthesis task as a quadratically constrained fractional-quadratic problem and compute rigorous fidelity upper bounds based on semidefinite relaxation. We apply our technique to three distinct experimental setups. The first two setups are, respectively, a free-space and a rich-scattering $4\\times 4$ MIMO channel at 2.45 GHz parameterized by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) comprising 100 1-bit-programmable elements. The third setup is a $4\\times 4$ MIMO channel at 19 GHz from four feeds of a dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) to four users. We systematically study how the achievable fidelity scales with the number of tunable elements, and we probe the tightness of our bounds by trying to find optimized configurations approaching the bounds with standard discrete-optimization techniques. We observe a strong influence of the coupling strength between tunable elements on our fidelity bound.

A UAV-mounted RIS provides blockage mitigation and passive beamforming, while the base station employs zero-forcing precoding for multiuser interference suppression. Due to limited feedback from UEHRs, their channel state information (CSI) is imperfect, leading to a worst-case secrecy energy efficiency (WCSEE) maximization problem. We jointly optimize the UAV horizontal position, RIS phase shifts, and transmit power allocation under both perfect and imperfect CSI, considering discrete RIS phases, UAV mobility, and energy-harvesting constraints. The resulting problem is highly nonconvex due to coupled channel geometry, robustness requirements, and discrete variables. To address this challenge, we propose a soft actor-critic (SAC)-based deep reinforcement learning framework that learns WCSEE-maximizing policies through interaction with the wireless environment. As a structured benchmark, a successive convex approximation (SCA) approach is developed for the perfect CSI case with continuous RIS phases.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cost-effective PLS design for IRS-assisted mMIMO systems by employing one-bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs). The focus is on jointly optimizing one-bit quantized precoding at the transmitter and constant-modulus phase shifts at the IRS to maximize the secrecy rate. This leads to a highly non-convex fractional secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem. To efficiently solve this problem, two algorithms are proposed: (1) the WMMSE-PDD algorithm, which reformulates the SRM problem into a sequence of non-fractional programs with auxiliary variables using the weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) method and solves them via the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) approach, achieving superior secrecy performance; and (2) the exact penalty product Riemannian gradient descent (EPPRGD) algorithm, which transforms the SRM problem into an unconstrained optimization over a product Riemannian manifold, eliminating auxiliary variables and enabling faster convergence with a slight trade-off in secrecy performance. Both algorithms provide analytical solutions at each iteration and are proven to converge to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points.

We first develop a sequential matched-filter estimator to acquire coarse angular parameters, followed by a range recovery process based on subcarrier phase differences. Subsequently, we formulate the target localization problem as a non-linear least squares optimization, using the coarse estimates to initialize the target's position coordinates. To solve this efficiently, we introduce a fast iterative refinement algorithm tailored for RIS-aided ISAC environments. Recognizing that the signal model involves both linear path gains and non-linear geometric dependencies, we exploit the separable least-squares structure to decouple these parameters. Furthermore, we propose a modified Levenberg algorithm with an approximation strategy, which enables low-cost parameter updates without necessitating repeated evaluations of the full non-linear model. Simulation results show that the proposed refinement method achieves accuracy comparable to conventional approaches, while significantly reducing algorithmic complexity."}

This letter derives a closed-form Cramér--Rao bound (CRB) for the joint estimation of range and medium conductivity from MI pilot observations in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework. The Fisher information matrix reveals that the joint estimation penalty converges to 3\\,dB in the near-field regime, meaning conductivity sensing adds at most a factor-of-two loss in ranging precision. Monte Carlo maximum-likelihood simulations confirm that the CRB is achievable under practical operating conditions."}

This may be interpreted as finding an autoregressive representative for sets of second-order stationary Gaussian processes. While Wasserstein, or optimal transport, barycenters have been successfully used earlier in problems of spectral estimation and clustering, the resulting barycenters are non-parametric and the complexity of representing and storing them depends on, e.g., the choice of discretization grid. In contrast, the herein proposed method yields compact, low-dimensional, and interpretable spectral centroids that can be used in downstream tasks. Computing the all-pole centroids corresponds to solving a non-convex optimization problem in the model parameters, and we present a gradient descent scheme for addressing this. Although convergence to a globally optimal point cannot be guaranteed, the sub-optimality of the obtained centroids can be quantified. The proposed method is illustrated on a problem of phoneme classification."}

Its eigenmodes define a spectral representation that inherently captures cross-domain interactions, in contrast to conventional Hodge-Laplacian eigenmodes that operate within a single topological dimension. In this paper, we compare the two alternatives in terms of the distortion/sparsity trade-off and we show how an overcomplete basis built concatenating the two dictionaries can provide better performance with respect to each approach. Then, we propose a parameterized nonredundant transform whose eigenmodes incorporate a mode-specific mass parameter that captures the interplay between node and edge modes. Interestingly, we show that learning the mass parameters from data makes the proposed transform able to achieve the best distortion-sparsity tradeoff with respect to both complete and overcomplete bases."}

This article introduces the principles of SAC for direct satellite-to-device uplink, showcasing precise direction-of-arrival estimation for user equipment (UE) devices, facilitating spatial signal separation, localization, and easing link budget constraints. Simulations for a low Earth orbit satellite at 600 km orbit and two UE devices performing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based transmission with polar coding at 3.5 GHz demonstrate block error rates below 0.1 with transmission powers as low as -10 dBm, even under strong interference when UE devices are resolved but fall on each other's strongest angular sidelobe. These results validate the ability of the proposed scheme to address mutual interference and stringent power limitations, paving the way for massive Internet of Things connectivity in non-terrestrial networks."}

However, radio-frequency (RF) signals, which underpin wireless systems, are still not natively supported by these models. Existing LLM-based approaches for telecom focus mainly on text and structured data, while conventional RF deep-learning models are built separately for specific signal-processing tasks, highlighting a clear gap between RF perception and high-level reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce RF-GPT, a radio-frequency language model (RFLM) that utilizes the visual encoders of multimodal LLMs to process and understand RF spectrograms. In this framework, complex in-phase/quadrature (IQ) waveforms are mapped to time-frequency spectrograms and then passed to pretrained visual encoders. The resulting representations are injected as RF tokens into a decoder-only LLM, which generates RF-grounded answers, explanations, and structured outputs. To train RF-GPT, we perform supervised instruction fine-tuning of a pretrained multimodal LLM using a fully synthetic RF corpus. Standards-compliant waveform generators produce wideband scenes for six wireless technologies, from which we derive time-frequency spectrograms, exact configuration metadata, and dense captions. A text-only LLM then converts these captions into RF-grounded instruction-answer pairs, yielding roughly 12,000 RF scenes and 0.625 million instruction examples without any manual labeling. Across benchmarks for wideband modulation classification, overlap analysis, wireless-technology recognition, WLAN user counting, and 5G NR information extraction, RF-GPT achieves strong multi-task performance, whereas general-purpose VLMs with no RF grounding largely fail."}

Two filter implementations, namely direct lattice and layout-balanced lattice topologies, are designed and fabricated in periodically poled piezoelectric film (P3F) thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). By leveraging the strong electromechanical coupling of XBARs in P3F TFLN together with the inherently wideband nature of the lattice topology, 3-dB fractional bandwidths (FBWs) of 27.42\\% and 39.11\\% and low insertion losses (ILs) of 0.88 dB and 0.96 dB are achieved at approximately 20 GHz for the direct and layout-balanced lattice filters, respectively, under conjugate matching. Notably, all prototypes feature compact footprints smaller than 1.3 mm\\textsuperscript{2}. These results highlight the potential of XBAR-based lattice architectures to enable low-loss, wideband acoustic filters for compact, high-performance RF front ends in next-generation wireless communication and sensing systems, while also identifying key challenges and directions for further optimization."}

Enabling real-time localization in large-scale multi-static deployments with thousands of devices require highly efficient algorithms for estimating key parameters such as range and angle of arrival (AoA), and for fusing these parameters into location estimates. We propose two low-complexity algorithms, Joint Range-Angle Clustering (JRAC) and Stage-wise Range-Angle Estimation (SRAE). Both deliver range and angle estimation accuracy comparable to FFT- and subspace-based baselines while significantly reducing the computation. We then introduce two real-time localization algorithms that fuse the estimated ranges and AoAs: a maximum-likelihood (ML) method solved via gradient search and an iterative re-weighted least squares (IRLS) method. Both achieve localization accuracy comparable to ML-based brute force search albeit with far lower complexity. Experiments on a real-world large-scale multi-static testbed with 4 illuminators, 1 multi-antenna receiver, and 100 tags show that JRAC and SRAE reduce runtime by up to 40X and IRLS achieves up to 500X reduction over ML-based brute force search without degrading localization accuracy. The proposed methods achieve 3 m median localization error across all 100 tags in a sub-6GHz band with 40 MHz bandwidth. These results demonstrate that multi-static range-angle estimation and localization algorithms can make real-time, scalable backscatter localization practical for next-generation ambient IoT networks."}
