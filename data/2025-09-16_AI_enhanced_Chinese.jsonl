However, these DAE approaches\npresented in prior works rely heavily on large-scale data collected through the\nbase station (BS) for model training, thus rendering excessive bandwidth usage\nand data privacy issues, particularly for mMIMO systems. When considering\nusers' mobility and encountering new channel environments, the existing CSI\nfeedback models may often need to be retrained. Returning back to previous\nenvironments, however, will make these models perform poorly and face the risk\nof catastrophic forgetting. To solve the above challenging problems, we propose\na novel gossiping generative adversarial network (Gossip-GAN)-aided CSI\nfeedback training framework. Notably, Gossip-GAN enables the CSI feedback\ntraining with low-overhead while preserving users' privacy. Specially, each\nuser collects a small amount of data to train a GAN model. Meanwhile, a fully\ndistributed gossip-learning strategy is exploited to avoid model overfitting,\nand to accelerate the model training as well. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat Gossip-GAN can i) achieve a similar CSI feedback accuracy as centralized\ntraining with real-world datasets, ii) address catastrophic forgetting\nchallenges in mobile scenarios, and iii) greatly reduce the uplink bandwidth\nusage.

Based on this architecture, three\npractical operating protocols are proposed: segment selection (SS), segment\naggregation (SA), and segment multiplexing (SM). For uplink SWAN\ncommunications, where one PA is activated per segment, the segmented structure\neliminates the inter-antenna radiation effect, i.e., signals captured by one PA\nmay re-radiate through other PAs along the same waveguide. This yields a\ntractable and physically consistent uplink signal model for a multi-PA\npinching-antenna system (PASS), which has not been established for conventional\nPASS using a single long waveguide. Building on this model, PA placement\nalgorithms are proposed to maximize the uplink signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).\nClosed-form expressions for the received SNR under the three protocols are\nderived, and the corresponding scaling laws with respect to the number of\nsegments are analyzed. It is proven that the segmented architecture reduces\nboth the average PA-to-user distance and the PA-to-feed distance, thereby\nmitigating both large-scale path loss and in-waveguide propagation loss. These\nresults are extended to downlink SWAN communications, where multiple PAs are\nactivated per segment, and PA placement methods are proposed to maximize the\ndownlink received SNR under the three protocols. Numerical results demonstrate\nthat: \\romannumeral1) among the three protocols, SM achieves the best\nperformance, followed by SA and then SS; and \\romannumeral2) for all protocols,\nthe proposed SWAN achieves a higher SNR than conventional PASS with a single\nlong waveguide in both uplink and downlink scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edfSWAN\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u6bb5\u6ce2\u5bfc\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u5929\u7ebf\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u534f\u8bae\uff08SS\u3001SA\u3001SM\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4fe1\u53f7\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684pinching-antenna\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08PASS\uff09\u5728\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u4e92\u8f90\u5c04\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u6bb5\u6ce2\u5bfc\u4f7f\u80fd\u7684pinching-antenna\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08SWAN\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u534f\u8bae\uff1a\u5206\u6bb5\u9009\u62e9\uff08SS\uff09\u3001\u5206\u6bb5\u805a\u5408\uff08SA\uff09\u548c\u5206\u6bb5\u590d\u7528\uff08SM\uff09\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0a\u884c\u94fe\u8def\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u6bb5\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u5929\u7ebf\u95f4\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u591aPA-PASS\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u51faPA\u653e\u7f6e\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff08SNR\uff09\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\u7684SNR\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684PA\u653e\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "SWAN\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6bb5\u7ed3\u6784\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5929\u7ebf\u95f4\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u7684PA\u653e\u7f6e\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\u7684SNR\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSM\u534f\u8bae\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f18\uff0cSA\u6b21\u4e4b\uff0cSS\u518d\u6b21\u4e4b\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfPASS\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cSWAN\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0a\u884c\u548c\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u4e2d\u5747\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684SNR\u3002", "conclusion": "SWAN\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u6bb5\u6ce2\u5bfc\u548cPA\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfPASS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u8f90\u5c04\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u964d\u4f4ePA\u5230\u7528\u6237\u548c\u9988\u6e90\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c0f\u4f20\u64ad\u635f\u8017\u3002\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\uff0cSM\u534f\u8bae\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfPASS\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cSWAN\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u4e2d\u5747\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8SNR\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper presents an extensive double-directional (D-D)\nchannel measurement campaign conducted in an outdoor street-canyon environment\nat 154 GHz and 300 GHz under both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight\n(NLoS) conditions using an in-house-developed channel sounder. Based on these\nmeasurements, clustering with merged datasets across the two frequencies\nenables comparative analyses that identify both common and distinct multipath\nclusters, as well as the frequency dependence of cluster-level characteristics.\nA quasi-deterministic (QD) channel model is then proposed, combining\ndeterministic components, such as LoS and single-bounce reflections from side\nwalls, with random components. Large-scale parameters (path loss, delay spread,\nangular spread, and Rician K-factor) are also evaluated.

Due to the highly complicated structure of the\nassociated sensing tensor, directly characterizing its optimization landscape\nis intractable. To address this, we introduce a tensor sensing problem as a\ntractable surrogate that preserves the essential structural features of the\ntarget low-rank tensor while enabling rigorous theoretical analysis. As a first\nstep toward understanding this surrogate model, we study the corresponding\npopulation risk, which captures key aspects of the underlying low-rank tensor\nstructure. We characterize the global landscape of the population risk on the\nunit sphere and show that Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) converges linearly\nunder mild conditions. We then extend the analysis to the tensor sensing\nproblem, establishing local geometric properties, proving convergence\nguarantees for RGD, and quantifying robustness under measurement noise.

This paper investigates channel reciprocity attack\n(CRACK) threats in multi-antenna wireless systems operating in time-division\nduplexing mode using a physically consistent non-reciprocal RIS (NR-RIS) model.\nCRACK can degrade communication rate and facilitate passive eavesdropping\nbehavior by distorting the downlink precoding, without requiring any additional\nsignal transmission or channel state information (CSI). Unlike conventional RIS\njamming strategies, the NR-RIS does not need synchronization with the\nlegitimate system and thus can operate with slow or fixed configurations to\nimplement CRACK, obscuring the distinction between the direct and RIS-induced\nchannels and thereby complicating corresponding defensive precoding designs. To\ncounter the CRACK threat posed by NR-RIS, we develop ``SecureCoder,'' a deep\nreinforcement learning-based framework that can mitigate CRACK and determine an\nimproved downlink precoder matrix using the estimated uplink CSI and rate\nfeedback from the users. Simulation results demonstrate the severe performance\ndegradation caused by NR-RIS CRACK and validate the effectiveness of\nSecureCoder in improving both throughput and reducing security threats, thereby\nenhancing system robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "RIS\u6280\u672f\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e5f\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u65f6\u5206\u53cc\u5de5\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u4e92\u6613RIS\uff08NR-RIS\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u65e0\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4fe1\u9053\u4e92\u6613\u6027\u653b\u51fb\uff08CRACK\uff09\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u3002CRACK\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u626d\u66f2\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u901f\u7387\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u88ab\u52a8\u7a83\u542c\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u8f93\u6216\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff08CSI\uff09\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684RIS\u5e72\u6270\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cNR-RIS\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u5408\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u53ef\u4ee5\u91c7\u7528\u6162\u901f\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\u914d\u7f6e\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0CRACK\uff0c\u6a21\u7cca\u4e86\u76f4\u8fde\u4fe1\u9053\u548cRIS\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u9632\u5fa1\u6027\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9NR-RIS\u5e26\u6765\u7684CRACK\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u201cSecureCoder\u201d\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u94fe\u8defCSI\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7684\u901f\u7387\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u7f13\u89e3CRACK\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86NR-RIS CRACK\u9020\u6210\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86SecureCoder\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76RIS\u6280\u672f\u5728\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u65f6\u5206\u53cc\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4e92\u6613\u6027\u653b\u51fb\uff08CRACK\uff09\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u975e\u4e92\u6613RIS\uff08NR-RIS\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u540d\u4e3a\u201cSecureCoder\u201d\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u94fe\u8defCSI\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7684\u901f\u7387\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u7f13\u89e3CRACK\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNR-RIS CRACK\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u964d\u4f4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800cSecureCoder\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "NR-RIS\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165CRACK\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u7ed9\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u5b89\u5168\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SecureCoder\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1CRACK\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

The biases are added to the proposed scheme to better\ndistinguish between Gaussian distributed noises in terms of their means, rather\nthan just using variances. Throughout the paper, we strive to minimize biases\nto achieve a power-efficient scheme. For the detection part of the proposed\nalgorithm, a Maximum-Likelihood (ML) detector is derived. The separability\ncondition of Gaussian distributions is investigated, along with the provision\nof a threshold-based detector that offers both simple and optimal thresholds in\nterms of minimizing the error probability. Some analysis of the proposed\nRH-KLJN communication scheme is provided, including Physical Layer Security\n(PLS) equations.
