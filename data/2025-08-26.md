### [1] [GreenTEA: Gradient Descent with Topic-modeling and Evolutionary Auto-prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16603)
*Zheng Dong,Luming Shang,Gabriela Olinto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GreenTEA是一种自动提示优化方法，结合多代理合作与遗传算法，有效平衡探索与利用，提升大模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手工设计高质量提示耗时耗力，现有自动优化方法在搜索效率和效果上存在挑战。

Method: 引入多代理合作框架，通过主题模型识别错误模式，利用遗传算法对提示进行演化优化。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验显示，GreenTEA优于手工提示和现有自动方法，提升推理和决策性能。

Conclusion: GreenTEA结合代理合作与遗传优化，为自动提示提供高效解决方案，有助于大模型应用扩展。

Abstract: High-quality prompts are crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve
exceptional performance. However, manually crafting effective prompts is
labor-intensive and demands significant domain expertise, limiting its
scalability. Existing automatic prompt optimization methods either extensively
explore new prompt candidates, incurring high computational costs due to
inefficient searches within a large solution space, or overly exploit feedback
on existing prompts, risking suboptimal optimization because of the complex
prompt landscape. To address these challenges, we introduce GreenTEA, an
agentic LLM workflow for automatic prompt optimization that balances candidate
exploration and knowledge exploitation. It leverages a collaborative team of
agents to iteratively refine prompts based on feedback from error samples. An
analyzing agent identifies common error patterns resulting from the current
prompt via topic modeling, and a generation agent revises the prompt to
directly address these key deficiencies. This refinement process is guided by a
genetic algorithm framework, which simulates natural selection by evolving
candidate prompts through operations such as crossover and mutation to
progressively optimize model performance. Extensive numerical experiments
conducted on public benchmark datasets suggest the superior performance of
GreenTEA against human-engineered prompts and existing state-of-the-arts for
automatic prompt optimization, covering logical and quantitative reasoning,
commonsense, and ethical decision-making.

### [2] [Cognitive Decision Routing in Large Language Models: When to Think Fast, When to Think Slow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16636)
*Y. Du,C. Guo,W. Wang,G. Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种认知决策路由（CDR）框架，依据查询特点动态选择推理策略，有效提升性能同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型在推理方式选择上的局限性，即无法动态调整推理深度，导致效率低或效果不佳。

Method: 引入元认知层，通过分析多维度的查询复杂性，动态决定采用快速直觉还是深度推理，结合认知科学理论设计。

Result: 在多种推理任务中表现优异，计算成本降低34%，专业判断任务中准确性提升18%，一致性提升23%。

Conclusion: 将认知科学原理应用于AI系统设计，实现了推理策略的自适应调整，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a fundamental challenge in deciding when to
rely on rapid, intuitive responses versus engaging in slower, more deliberate
reasoning. Inspired by Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory and his insights
on human cognitive biases, we propose a novel Cognitive Decision Routing (CDR)
framework that dynamically determines the appropriate reasoning strategy based
on query characteristics. Our approach addresses the current limitations where
models either apply uniform reasoning depth or rely on computationally
expensive methods for all queries. We introduce a meta-cognitive layer that
analyzes query complexity through multiple dimensions: correlation strength
between given information and required conclusions, domain boundary crossings,
stakeholder multiplicity, and uncertainty levels. Through extensive experiments
on diverse reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that CDR achieves superior
performance while reducing computational costs by 34\% compared to uniform deep
reasoning approaches. Our framework shows particular strength in professional
judgment tasks, achieving 23\% improvement in consistency and 18\% better
accuracy on expert-level evaluations. This work bridges cognitive science
principles with practical AI system design, offering a principled approach to
adaptive reasoning in LLMs.

### [3] [Trust but Verify! A Survey on Verification Design for Test-time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16665)
*V Venktesh,Mandeep rathee,Avishek Anand*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了测试时比例调整（TTS）在提升大规模语言模型性能中的应用，重点分析了验证器（verifiers）的多样策略及其训练方法，强调其在推理过程中通过额外计算资源提升模型表现的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的发展，如何在推理时有效提升其性能成为研究热点，验证器作为一种无需参数调整即可在推理时实现性能增强的方法，受到广泛关注。

Method: 本文系统整理了文献中的不同验证策略，分类讨论了验证器的类型及其训练机制，提出了一个统一视角以理解验证器在测试时比例调整中的作用与实现。

Result: 通过分析多种验证策略和训练机制，本文梳理了验证器的设计思路和应用场景，为未来在推理优化中使用验证器提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Conclusion: 验证器在测试时比例调整中具有重要作用，具有参数无关、效果显著的优势，未来应进一步探索其多样化设计和训练方法，推动大语言模型的性能提升。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a new frontier for scaling the
performance of Large Language Models. In test-time scaling, by using more
computational resources during inference, LLMs can improve their reasoning
process and task performance. Several approaches have emerged for TTS such as
distilling reasoning traces from another model or exploring the vast decoding
search space by employing a verifier. The verifiers serve as reward models that
help score the candidate outputs from the decoding process to diligently
explore the vast solution space and select the best outcome. This paradigm
commonly termed has emerged as a superior approach owing to parameter free
scaling at inference time and high performance gains. The verifiers could be
prompt-based, fine-tuned as a discriminative or generative model to verify
process paths, outcomes or both. Despite their widespread adoption, there is no
detailed collection, clear categorization and discussion of diverse
verification approaches and their training mechanisms. In this survey, we cover
the diverse approaches in the literature and present a unified view of verifier
training, types and their utility in test-time scaling. Our repository can be

### [4] [Do Cognitively Interpretable Reasoning Traces Improve LLM Performance?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16695)
*Siddhant Bhambri,Upasana Biswas,Subbarao Kambhampati*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，链式推理中的中间推理轨迹是否具有可解释性与模型性能之间存在显著差异，较强的性能未必意味着轨迹的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨链式推理轨迹的可解释性是否有助于提升大型语言模型的任务表现。

Method: 在Open Book问答任务中，通过对四种不同类型的推理轨迹进行微调，并进行人类评估来分析可解释性与性能之间的关系。

Result: 微调使用原始推理轨迹的模型性能最佳，但这些轨迹被人类评价为最难解释；可解释性与性能存在明显的反向关系。

Conclusion: 模型性能与推理轨迹的可解释性不一定一致，提示应考虑将中间推理信息与最终可理解性分离。

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) has been
driven by introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, where models generate
intermediate reasoning traces before producing an answer. These traces, as in
DeepSeek R1, are not only used to guide inference but also serve as supervision
signals for distillation into smaller models. A common but often implicit
assumption is that CoT traces should be semantically meaningful and
interpretable to the end user. While recent research questions the need for
semantic nature of these traces, in this paper, we ask: ``\textit{Must CoT
reasoning traces be interpretable to enhance LLM task performance?}" We
investigate this question in the Open Book Question-Answering domain by
supervised fine-tuning LLaMA and Qwen models on four types of reasoning traces:
(1) DeepSeek R1 traces, (2) LLM-generated summaries of R1 traces, (3)
LLM-generated post-hoc explanations of R1 traces, and (4) algorithmically
generated verifiably correct traces. To quantify the trade-off between
interpretability and performance, we further conduct a human-subject study with
100 participants rating the interpretability of each trace type. Our results
reveal a striking mismatch: while fine-tuning on R1 traces yields the strongest
performance, participants judged these traces to be the least interpretable.
These findings suggest that it is useful to decouple intermediate tokens from
end user interpretability.

### [5] [QueryBandits for Hallucination Mitigation: Exploiting Semantic Features for No-Regret Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16697)
*Nicole Cho,William Watson,Alec Koppel,Sumitra Ganesh,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出QueryBandits框架，通过查询重写抑制大模型的幻觉偏差，显著优于静态提示和无重写方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型中幻觉问题，现有方法多关注后期过滤，缺乏主动引导机制。

Method: 利用多语言特征构建奖励模型，通过上下文多臂赌博机策略实现查询重写，通过引导模型输出。

Result: 在多个问答基准测试中，QueryBandits显著优于对比方法，提升效果；发现没有单一的最优重写策略，强调动态引导的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过语义特征引导的动态重写，有效减少幻觉，避免模型再训练，展现出潜力和灵活性。

Abstract: Advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) have caused
higher hallucination prevalence; yet most mitigation work focuses on
after-the-fact filtering rather than shaping the queries that trigger them. We
introduce QueryBandits, a bandit framework that designs rewrite strategies to
maximize a reward model, that encapsulates hallucination propensity based upon
the sensitivities of 17 linguistic features of the input query-and therefore,
proactively steer LLMs away from generating hallucinations. Across 13 diverse
QA benchmarks and 1,050 lexically perturbed queries per dataset, our top
contextual QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a
no-rewrite baseline and also outperforms zero-shot static prompting
("paraphrase" or "expand") by 42.6% and 60.3% respectively. Therefore, we
empirically substantiate the effectiveness of QueryBandits in mitigating
hallucination via the intervention that takes the form of a query rewrite.
Interestingly, certain static prompting strategies, which constitute a
considerable number of current query rewriting literature, have a higher
cumulative regret than the no-rewrite baseline, signifying that static rewrites
can worsen hallucination. Moreover, we discover that the converged per-arm
regression feature weight vectors substantiate that there is no single rewrite
strategy optimal for all queries. In this context, guided rewriting via
exploiting semantic features with QueryBandits can induce significant shifts in
output behavior through forward-pass mechanisms, bypassing the need for
retraining or gradient-based adaptation.

### [6] [Assessing Consciousness-Related Behaviors in Large Language Models Using the Maze Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16705)
*Rui A. Pimenta,Tim Schlippe,Kristina Schaaff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在“迷宫测试”中展示出部分类意识行为，但仍缺乏持续的自我认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大规模语言模型是否具备类似意识的行为及其潜在限制。

Method: 通过“迷宫测试”评估多种LLMs的空间认知、视角转换、目标导向和时间序列能力，并结合13个意识特征进行评估。

Result: 表现较好的模型在路径完成度上有所提升，但在保持连贯自我模型方面仍存在困难，表现出意识的某些特征但缺乏持久的自我意识。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs表现出部分意识相关行为，但尚未具备完整的意识特征，尤其是持续的自我认知能力。

Abstract: We investigate consciousness-like behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs)
using the Maze Test, challenging models to navigate mazes from a first-person
perspective. This test simultaneously probes spatial awareness,
perspective-taking, goal-directed behavior, and temporal sequencing-key
consciousness-associated characteristics. After synthesizing consciousness
theories into 13 essential characteristics, we evaluated 12 leading LLMs across
zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning scenarios. Results showed
reasoning-capable LLMs consistently outperforming standard versions, with
Gemini 2.0 Pro achieving 52.9% Complete Path Accuracy and DeepSeek-R1 reaching
80.5% Partial Path Accuracy. The gap between these metrics indicates LLMs
struggle to maintain coherent self-models throughout solutions -- a fundamental
consciousness aspect. While LLMs show progress in consciousness-related
behaviors through reasoning mechanisms, they lack the integrated, persistent
self-awareness characteristic of consciousness.

### [7] [Sparse and Dense Retrievers Learn Better Together: Joint Sparse-Dense Optimization for Text-Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16707)
*Jonghyun Song,Youngjune Lee,Gyu-Hwung Cho,Ilhyeon Song,Saehun Kim,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种结合稠密与稀疏表示的双向自我知识蒸馏方法，有效提升多模态检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多模态检索方法依赖昂贵对比预训练或蒸馏导致的限制，提升效率与性能。

Method: 通过自我知识蒸馏实现稠密与稀疏表征的双向学习，利用集成相似度作为教师信号，并微调关键层。

Result: 在MSCOCO和Flickr30k数据上，稀疏检索器超越现有稀疏基准，接近或超过密集模型表现，保持稀疏模型优势。

Conclusion: 提出的框架高效且有效，增强了多模态检索系统的表现与实用性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models have achieved impressive performance
on multimodal tasks, including text-image retrieval, based on dense
representations. Meanwhile, Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) has gained traction
in text-only settings due to its interpretability and efficiency with fast
term-based lookup via inverted indexes. Inspired by these advantages, recent
work has extended LSR to the multimodal domain. However, these methods often
rely on computationally expensive contrastive pre-training, or distillation
from a frozen dense model, which limits the potential for mutual enhancement.
To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective framework that
enables bi-directional learning between dense and sparse representations
through Self-Knowledge Distillation. This bi-directional learning is achieved
using an integrated similarity score-a weighted sum of dense and sparse
similarities-which serves as a shared teacher signal for both representations.
To ensure efficiency, we fine-tune the final layer of the dense encoder and the
sparse projection head, enabling easy adaptation of any existing VLP model.
Experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k demonstrate that our sparse retriever not
only outperforms existing sparse baselines, but also achieves performance
comparable to-or even surpassing-its dense counterparts, while retaining the
benefits of sparse models.

### [8] [Error Reflection Prompting: Can Large Language Models Successfully Understand Errors?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16729)
*Jason Li,Lauren Yraola,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Chain-of-thought的错误反思提示（ERP），增强模型的反思和纠错能力，提高推理的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补链式思维（CoT）在反思与错误纠正方面的不足，提升模型推理能力。

Method: 在CoT基础上引入错误识别和正确回答，结合自动ERP生成，形成逐步识别和修正错误的流程。

Result: ERP作为CoT的有效补充，增强了模型推理的稳健性和解释性。

Conclusion: ERP能够提升语言模型的推理能力和可靠性，有望在实际应用中推广。

Abstract: Prompting methods for language models, such as Chain-of-thought (CoT),
present intuitive step-by-step processes for problem solving. These
methodologies aim to equip models with a better understanding of the correct
procedures for addressing a given task. Despite these advancements, CoT lacks
the ability of reflection and error correction, potentially causing a model to
perpetuate mistakes and errors. Therefore, inspired by the human ability for
said tasks, we propose Error Reflection Prompting (ERP) to further enhance
reasoning in language models. Building upon CoT, ERP is a method comprised of
an incorrect answer, error recognition, and a correct answer. This process
enables the model to recognize types of errors and the steps that lead to
incorrect answers, allowing the model to better discern which steps to avoid
and which to take. The model is able to generate the error outlines itself with
automated ERP generation, allowing for error recognition and correction to be
integrated into the reasoning chain and produce scalability and reliability in
the process. The results demonstrate that ERP serves as a versatile supplement
to conventional CoT, ultimately contributing to more robust and capable
reasoning abilities along with increased interpretability in how models
ultimately reach their errors.

*Nitin Gupta,Pallav Koppisetti,Kausik Lakkaraju,Biplav Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GAICo是一款开源Python库，用于标准化和简化生成式AI的性能评估，支持多模态、多结构化数据的比对，提升评估效率和结果的可比性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI在高风险领域的应用推广，亟需一种统一、可靠的评估工具，以克服现有评估方法的零散和不适应问题，从而促进AI系统的快速、安全发展。

Method: 开发了支持多种参考指标和多模态数据的GAICo库，具有高层API和详细指标访问，结合案例研究验证其实用性。

Result: GAICo实现了多模态、多结构化数据的标准化评估，提升了评估效率，促进了AI系统的优化，获得了社区广泛关注。

Conclusion: GAICo有效解决了生成式AI评估中的碎片化问题，成为推动AI开发更快、更可信的重要工具。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Generative AI (GenAI) into diverse, high-stakes
domains necessitates robust and reproducible evaluation methods. However,
practitioners often resort to ad-hoc, non-standardized scripts, as common
metrics are often unsuitable for specialized, structured outputs (e.g.,
automated plans, time-series) or holistic comparison across modalities (e.g.,
text, audio, and image). This fragmentation hinders comparability and slows AI
system development. To address this challenge, we present GAICo (Generative AI
Comparator): a deployed, open-source Python library that streamlines and
standardizes GenAI output comparison. GAICo provides a unified, extensible
framework supporting a comprehensive suite of reference-based metrics for
unstructured text, specialized structured data formats, and multimedia (images,
audio). Its architecture features a high-level API for rapid, end-to-end
analysis, from multi-model comparison to visualization and reporting, alongside
direct metric access for granular control. We demonstrate GAICo's utility
through a detailed case study evaluating and debugging complex, multi-modal AI
Travel Assistant pipelines. GAICo empowers AI researchers and developers to
efficiently assess system performance, make evaluation reproducible, improve
development velocity, and ultimately build more trustworthy AI systems,
aligning with the goal of moving faster and safer in AI deployment. Since its
release on PyPI in Jun 2025, the tool has been downloaded over 13K times,
across versions, by Aug 2025, demonstrating growing community interest.

TL;DR: 系统评估大规模模型与轻量级模型在信息检索中的表现差异，发现基于LLM的方法在新颖查询中表现不一，提示其泛化能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究不同重排序方法在信息检索中的性能差异及其泛化能力，特别是面对未见查询的表现。

Method: 系统比较22种不同的重排序方法，包括LLM基础、轻量级和零样本策略，在多个标准数据库上进行实验，分析训练数据重叠、模型结构和效率对性能的影响。

Result: LLM重排序器在已知查询中优于轻量级模型，但在新颖查询中的表现差异显著，模型的泛化能力存在限制，且新颖性对效果有较大影响。

Conclusion: 现有方法在新颖查询上的泛化能力有限，未来应优化模型设计以提升其适应性。

Abstract: In this work, we present a systematic and comprehensive empirical evaluation
of state-of-the-art reranking methods, encompassing large language model
(LLM)-based, lightweight contextual, and zero-shot approaches, with respect to
their performance in information retrieval tasks. We evaluate in total 22
methods, including 40 variants (depending on used LLM) across several
established benchmarks, including TREC DL19, DL20, and BEIR, as well as a novel
dataset designed to test queries unseen by pretrained models. Our primary goal
is to determine, through controlled and fair comparisons, whether a performance
disparity exists between LLM-based rerankers and their lightweight
counterparts, particularly on novel queries, and to elucidate the underlying
causes of any observed differences. To disentangle confounding factors, we
analyze the effects of training data overlap, model architecture, and
computational efficiency on reranking performance. Our findings indicate that
while LLM-based rerankers demonstrate superior performance on familiar queries,
their generalization ability to novel queries varies, with lightweight models
offering comparable efficiency. We further identify that the novelty of queries
significantly impacts reranking effectiveness, highlighting limitations in
existing approaches.

### [11] [Toward Socially Aware Vision-Language Models: Evaluating Cultural Competence Through Multimodal Story Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16762)
*Arka Mukherjee,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统性评估了多模态视觉-语言模型在文化适应性方面的能力，发现其表现存在显著差异和潜在偏差，强调了文化认知在多模态AI中的重要性与挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉-语言模型在不同文化背景下的广泛应用，确保其文化适应能力成为负责任AI的关键。

Method: 通过引入新颖的多模态干预框架，在文本提示和视觉输入中嵌入文化身份线索，评估五种主流模型在故事生成任务中的表现。

Result: 模型展现出一定的文化适应能力，能生成具有文化特色的词汇，但不同模型的文化认知差异明显，存在偏差和局限，跨模态评估表明视觉语义理解有限。

Conclusion: 多模态AI在文化认知方面仍面临挑战，未来需优化模型偏差并增强文化理解能力，以实现更公平和有效的跨文化应用。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve widespread deployment across diverse
cultural contexts, ensuring their cultural competence becomes critical for
responsible AI systems. While prior work has evaluated cultural awareness in
text-only models and VLM object recognition tasks, no research has
systematically assessed how VLMs adapt outputs when cultural identity cues are
embedded in both textual prompts and visual inputs during generative tasks. We
present the first comprehensive evaluation of VLM cultural competence through
multimodal story generation, developing a novel multimodal framework that
perturbs cultural identity and evaluates 5 contemporary VLMs on a downstream
task: story generation. Our analysis reveals significant cultural adaptation
capabilities, with rich culturally-specific vocabulary spanning names, familial
terms, and geographic markers. However, we uncover concerning limitations:
cultural competence varies dramatically across architectures, some models
exhibit inverse cultural alignment, and automated metrics show architectural
bias contradicting human assessments. Cross-modal evaluation shows that
culturally distinct outputs are indeed detectable through visual-semantic
similarity (28.7% within-nationality vs. 0.2% cross-nationality recall), yet
visual-cultural understanding remains limited. In essence, we establish the
promise and challenges of cultural competence in multimodal AI. We publicly
release our codebase and data: https://github.com/ArkaMukherjee0/mmCultural

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种新框架，通过识别和补充关键信息，提高线上心理健康社区的用户互动率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决OMHC中未回应帖子问题，增强用户支持信息的完整性。

Method: 构建REDDME数据集，设计Hierarchical Support Attributes Taxonomy（CueTaxo），开发MH-COPILOT系统结合强化学习进行支持属性识别和问题引导。

Result: 模型显著提升了支持属性的提取效率和用户参与度，经实验证明有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效增强了OMHC中支持信息的完整性与用户互动，为心理健康支持提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Online Mental Health Communities (OMHCs) provide crucial peer and expert
support, yet many posts remain unanswered due to missing support attributes
that signal the need for help. We present a novel framework that identifies
these gaps and prompts users to enrich their posts, thereby improving
engagement. To support this, we introduce REDDME, a new dataset of 4,760 posts
from mental health subreddits annotated for the span and intensity of three key
support attributes: event what happened?, effect what did the user experience?,
and requirement what support they need?. Next, we devise a hierarchical
taxonomy, CueTaxo, of support attributes for controlled question generation.
Further, we propose MH-COPILOT, a reinforcement learning-based system that
integrates (a) contextual attribute-span identification, (b) support attribute
intensity classification, (c) controlled question generation via a hierarchical
taxonomy, and (d) a verifier for reward modeling. Our model dynamically
assesses posts for the presence/absence of support attributes, and generates
targeted prompts to elicit missing information. Empirical results across four
notable language models demonstrate significant improvements in attribute
elicitation and user engagement. A human evaluation further validates the
model's effectiveness in real-world OMHC settings.

TL;DR: ReProCon是一种结合多原型、对比学习和元学习的少样本生物医学命名实体识别框架，能在有限资源下保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学领域NER中的数据稀缺和标签不平衡问题，尤其是在细粒度实体类别中。

Method: 引入多原型建模、余弦对比学习和Reptile元学习，配合轻量级编码器，实现良好的类别区分和快速适应。

Result: 实现接近BERT性能的识别效果，并在资源受限环境下展现出优越的稳定性和抗类别扩展能力，优于多个基线模型。

Conclusion: 多原型和对比学习在资源有限的情况下提升NER性能，适用于生物医学应用，解决类别不平衡和标签歧义等挑战。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in biomedical domains faces challenges due to
data scarcity and imbalanced label distributions, especially with fine-grained
entity types. We propose ReProCon, a novel few-shot NER framework that combines
multi-prototype modeling, cosine-contrastive learning, and Reptile
meta-learning to tackle these issues. By representing each category with
multiple prototypes, ReProCon captures semantic variability, such as synonyms
and contextual differences, while a cosine-contrastive objective ensures strong
interclass separation. Reptile meta-updates enable quick adaptation with little
data. Using a lightweight fastText + BiLSTM encoder with much lower memory
usage, ReProCon achieves a macro-$F_1$ score close to BERT-based baselines
(around 99 percent of BERT performance). The model remains stable with a label
budget of 30 percent and only drops 7.8 percent in $F_1$ when expanding from 19
to 50 categories, outperforming baselines such as SpanProto and CONTaiNER,
which see 10 to 32 percent degradation in Few-NERD. Ablation studies highlight
the importance of multi-prototype modeling and contrastive learning in managing
class imbalance. Despite difficulties with label ambiguity, ReProCon
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in resource-limited settings, making
it suitable for biomedical applications.

Motivation: 揭示大模型在语法结构识别中的误判机制及潜在偏差。

Method: 采用行为探测任务和元语言探测任务，模拟假设检验以检测模型的确认偏差。

Result: 模型确实会产生虚假的语法结构假设，高精度的模拟验证了确认偏差的存在。

Conclusion: 提示构造探测方法存在确认偏差，进一步揭示模型潜在的错误语法知识。

Abstract: This paper investigates false positive constructions: grammatical structures
which an LLM hallucinates as distinct constructions but which human
introspection does not support. Both a behavioural probing task using
contextual embeddings and a meta-linguistic probing task using prompts are
included, allowing us to distinguish between implicit and explicit linguistic
knowledge. Both methods reveal that models do indeed hallucinate constructions.
We then simulate hypothesis testing to determine what would have happened if a
linguist had falsely hypothesized that these hallucinated constructions do
exist. The high accuracy obtained shows that such false hypotheses would have
been overwhelmingly confirmed. This suggests that construction probing methods
suffer from a confirmation bias and raises the issue of what unknown and
incorrect syntactic knowledge these models also possess.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成性问答中预设引发的不一致性和大模型的提示敏感性难题。

Method: 设计一个结构化且鲁棒的验证框架，通过拆解问题避免预设依赖，并通过多实验验证其效果。

Result: 该方法在多个数据集和模型上显著改善性能，提升幅度达2-5%。

Conclusion: 结构化拆解问题的方法有效缓解预设偏差和提示敏感性难题，增强问答系统的稳定性和可靠性。

Abstract: Prior work has shown that presupposition in generated questions can introduce
unverified assumptions, leading to inconsistencies in claim verification.
Additionally, prompt sensitivity remains a significant challenge for large
language models (LLMs), resulting in performance variance as high as 3-6%.
While recent advancements have reduced this gap, our study demonstrates that
prompt sensitivity remains a persistent issue. To address this, we propose a
structured and robust claim verification framework that reasons through
presupposition-free, decomposed questions. Extensive experiments across
multiple prompts, datasets, and LLMs reveal that even state-of-the-art models
remain susceptible to prompt variance and presupposition. Our method

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于质量过滤、条件路由和合作式师生教导的知识蒸馏方法QR-Distill，有效提升大规模语言模型的推理能力，适用于资源受限场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决知识蒸馏在捕捉教师模型全面推理能力方面的局限，尤其是在多路径推理中路径质量不同且难以统一处理的问题。

Method: 结合路径质量筛选、条件路由和合作师生教学，通过多路径筛选、动态路径分配和相互学习提升蒸馏效果。

Result: 实验表明QR-Distill优于传统方法，且各个组件对知识传递效果均至关重要。

Conclusion: 多路径质量筛选与动态路由结合合作式学习有助于提升知识蒸馏的性能，从而在资源有限的环境中增强模型推理能力。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) significantly enhance reasoning
capabilities but their deployment is restricted in resource-constrained
scenarios. Knowledge distillation addresses this by transferring knowledge from
powerful teacher models to compact and transparent students. However,
effectively capturing the teacher's comprehensive reasoning is challenging due
to conventional token-level supervision's limited scope. Using multiple
reasoning paths per query alleviates this problem, but treating each path
identically is suboptimal as paths vary widely in quality and suitability
across tasks and models. We propose Quality-filtered Routing with Cooperative
Distillation (QR-Distill), combining path quality filtering, conditional
routing, and cooperative peer teaching. First, quality filtering retains only
correct reasoning paths scored by an LLM-based evaluation. Second, conditional
routing dynamically assigns paths tailored to each student's current learning
state. Finally, cooperative peer teaching enables students to mutually distill
diverse insights, addressing knowledge gaps and biases toward specific
reasoning styles. Experiments demonstrate QR-Distill's superiority over
traditional single- and multi-path distillation methods. Ablation studies
further highlight the importance of each component including quality filtering,
conditional routing, and peer teaching in effective knowledge transfer. Our
code is available at https://github.com/LzyFischer/Distill.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QFrCoLA 数据集用于评估大规模语言模型对法语（特别是魁北克法语）语言判定的能力，结果显示微调后模型表现优异，预训练的跨语言模型在此任务中表现较差，表明其未充分掌握魁北克法语的语言规范。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型如何内部化语言知识以及评估其在不同语言中的语言判定能力，特别是魁北克法语。

Method: 构建QFrCoLA数据集并利用它以及其他七个语料库，基准测试七种不同的语言模型，包括微调和零样本模型。

Result: 微调的Transformer模型在魁北克法语的语料库上表现优越，预训练的跨语言模型在此任务中表现较差；QFrCoLA的设计表明模型在掌握语言规范方面仍有挑战。

Conclusion: 微调模型可以显著提升对语言规范的判定能力，而预训练跨语言模型在特定语言的判定上仍有较大提升空间，QFrCoLA作为评价工具具有挑战性，适合评估模型的语言判断能力。

Abstract: Large and Transformer-based language models perform outstandingly in various
downstream tasks. However, there is limited understanding regarding how these
models internalize linguistic knowledge, so various linguistic benchmarks have
recently been proposed to facilitate syntactic evaluation of language models
across languages. This paper introduces QFrCoLA (Quebec-French Corpus of
Linguistic Acceptability Judgments), a normative binary acceptability judgments
dataset comprising 25,153 in-domain and 2,675 out-of-domain sentences. Our
study leverages the QFrCoLA dataset and seven other linguistic binary
acceptability judgment corpora to benchmark seven language models. The results
demonstrate that, on average, fine-tuned Transformer-based LM are strong
baselines for most languages and that zero-shot binary classification large
language models perform poorly on the task. However, for the QFrCoLA benchmark,
on average, a fine-tuned Transformer-based LM outperformed other methods
tested. It also shows that pre-trained cross-lingual LLMs selected for our
experimentation do not seem to have acquired linguistic judgment capabilities
during their pre-training for Quebec French. Finally, our experiment results on
QFrCoLA show that our dataset, built from examples that illustrate linguistic
norms rather than speakers' feelings, is similar to linguistic acceptability
judgment; it is a challenging dataset that can benchmark LM on their linguistic
judgment capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在法律领域简化文本以保障准确性的同时保持法律意义，存在特殊挑战。

Method: 构建FrJUDGE数据集和设计JUDGEBERT评估指标，用以衡量法律文本简化中的意义保持。

Result: JUDGEBERT与人类判断相关性更高，表现优越，并通过关键的验证测试。

Conclusion: JUDGEBERT有望改善法律NLP中的文本简化，确保法律理解的准确性和易用性。

Abstract: Simplifying text while preserving its meaning is a complex yet essential
task, especially in sensitive domain applications like legal texts. When
applied to a specialized field, like the legal domain, preservation differs
significantly from its role in regular texts. This paper introduces FrJUDGE, a
new dataset to assess legal meaning preservation between two legal texts. It
also introduces JUDGEBERT, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess legal
meaning preservation in French legal text simplification. JUDGEBERT
demonstrates a superior correlation with human judgment compared to existing
metrics. It also passes two crucial sanity checks, while other metrics did not:
For two identical sentences, it always returns a score of 100%; on the other
hand, it returns 0% for two unrelated sentences. Our findings highlight its
potential to transform legal NLP applications, ensuring accuracy and
accessibility for text simplification for legal practitioners and lay users.

TL;DR: DeAR框架通过双阶段策略，提高了文档重排序的准确性和解释性，超越多个基线和版本的GPT-4，展示了优异的性能和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单一模型在细粒度相关性评分与全局跨文档分析中的平衡问题，提升文档重排序的效果与可解释性。

Method: 采用双阶段策略：第一阶段从预训练教师模型中蒸馏相关信号，第二阶段附加LoRA适配器，利用链式思维进行listwise推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上超越开源基线，部分指标超过GPT-4，在开域问答中表现优异，验证了其稳定性与效果。

Conclusion: DeAR是一个高效、可解释的文档重排序解决方案，适用于现代信息检索系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed listwise document reranking by
enabling global reasoning over candidate sets, yet single models often struggle
to balance fine-grained relevance scoring with holistic cross-document
analysis. We propose \textbf{De}ep\textbf{A}gent\textbf{R}ank (\textbf{\DeAR}),
an open-source framework that decouples these tasks through a dual-stage
approach, achieving superior accuracy and interpretability. In \emph{Stage 1},
we distill token-level relevance signals from a frozen 13B LLaMA teacher into a
compact \{3, 8\}B student model using a hybrid of cross-entropy, RankNet, and
KL divergence losses, ensuring robust pointwise scoring. In \emph{Stage 2}, we
attach a second LoRA adapter and fine-tune on 20K GPT-4o-generated
chain-of-thought permutations, enabling listwise reasoning with
natural-language justifications. Evaluated on TREC-DL19/20, eight BEIR
datasets, and NovelEval-2306, \DeAR surpasses open-source baselines by +5.1
nDCG@5 on DL20 and achieves 90.97 nDCG@10 on NovelEval, outperforming GPT-4 by
+3.09. Without fine-tuning on Wikipedia, DeAR also excels in open-domain QA,
achieving 54.29 Top-1 accuracy on Natural Questions, surpassing baselines like
MonoT5, UPR, and RankGPT. Ablations confirm that dual-loss distillation ensures
stable calibration, making \DeAR a highly effective and interpretable solution
for modern reranking systems.\footnote{Dataset and code available at

Method: 构建POMDP模型，利用信息瓶颈最大化方法，结合模型基础强化学习框架，进行多任务联合训练。

Result: 模型在情感分类和情感识别方面达到最先进水平，提升对话质量，并在外域任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: 用户信念建模和模型联合训练有效增强对话系统的表现和泛化能力。

Abstract: World models have been widely utilized in robotics, gaming, and auto-driving.
However, their applications on natural language tasks are relatively limited.
In this paper, we construct the dialogue world model, which could predict the
user's emotion, sentiment, and intention, and future utterances. By defining a
POMDP, we argue emotion, sentiment and intention can be modeled as the user
belief and solved by maximizing the information bottleneck. By this user belief
modeling, we apply the model-based reinforcement learning framework to the
dialogue system, and propose a framework called DreamCUB. Experiments show that
the pretrained dialogue world model can achieve state-of-the-art performances
on emotion classification and sentiment identification, while dialogue quality
is also enhanced by joint training of the policy, critic and dialogue world
model. Further analysis shows that this manner holds a reasonable
exploration-exploitation balance and also transfers well to out-of-domain
scenarios such as empathetic dialogues.

TL;DR: 标题的语言框架显著影响用户的搜索行为，短期内框架效应明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨细微提示如标题框架对用户搜索行为的影响，补充已有的认知偏差研究。

Method: 通过控件实验让参与者提出搜索查询，分析不同框架对后续搜索行为的影响。

Result: 不同枠架显著改变搜索策略，短期内有持续影响，部分枠架效果随时间减弱。

Conclusion: 即使短暂曝光，标题框架也能显著改变用户的信息搜索方向。

Abstract: Search engines play a central role in how people gather information, but
subtle cues like headline framing may influence not only what users believe but
also how they search. While framing effects on judgment are well documented,
their impact on subsequent search behavior is less understood. We conducted a
controlled experiment where participants issued queries and selected from
headlines filtered by specific linguistic frames. Headline framing
significantly shaped follow-up queries: conflict and strategy frames disrupted
alignment with prior selections, while episodic frames led to more concrete
queries than thematic ones. We also observed modest short-term frame
persistence that declined over time. These results suggest that even brief
exposure to framing can meaningfully alter the direction of users
information-seeking behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型作为评判者在理解目标和风险自我评估方面的可靠性。

Method: 提出OBJEX(MT)基准，评估模型提取目标和自信的能力，通过多项指标衡量其准确性和校准性。

Result: 发现不同模型在目标提取和校准方面表现差异显著，尤其在对抗性场景中，模型常高置信度误判。

Conclusion: 建议在实际应用中提供明确目标，并采用选择性预测或放弃策略以控制风险。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges of other models,
yet it is unclear whether a judge can reliably infer the latent objective of
the conversation it evaluates, especially when the goal is distributed across
noisy, adversarial, multi-turn jailbreaks. We introduce OBJEX(MT), a benchmark
that requires a model to (i) distill a transcript into a single-sentence base
objective and (ii) report its own confidence. Accuracy is scored by an LLM
judge using semantic similarity between extracted and gold objectives;
correctness uses a single human-aligned threshold calibrated once on N=100
items (tau* = 0.61); and metacognition is evaluated with ECE, Brier score,
Wrong@High-Conf, and risk-coverage curves. We evaluate gpt-4.1,
claude-sonnet-4, and Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP8 on SafeMT Attack_600, SafeMTData_1K,
MHJ, and CoSafe. claude-sonnet-4 attains the highest objective-extraction
accuracy (0.515) and the best calibration (ECE 0.296; Brier 0.324), while
gpt-4.1 and Qwen3 tie at 0.441 accuracy yet show marked overconfidence (mean
confidence approx. 0.88 vs. accuracy approx. 0.44; Wrong@0.90 approx. 48-52%).
Performance varies sharply across datasets (approx. 0.167-0.865), with MHJ
comparatively easy and Attack_600/CoSafe harder. These results indicate that
LLM judges often misinfer objectives with high confidence in multi-turn
jailbreaks and suggest operational guidance: provide judges with explicit
objectives when possible and use selective prediction or abstention to manage
risk. We release prompts, scoring templates, and complete logs to facilitate
replication and analysis.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在自动包生成中面临的计算成本高和知识冲突问题。

Method: 提取不同类型的知识，训练专门的LoRA专家，再用动态融合模块进行知识路由与集成，同时设计推理增强模块以提高可靠性。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上实现了与教师模型相当甚至更优的准确率，同时保持较强的计算效率，优于现有的几种方法。

Conclusion: RouteDK通过知识路由和冲突缓解，有效提升包生成的性能，是一种高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in automatic bundle
generation but suffer from prohibitive computational costs. Although knowledge
distillation offers a pathway to more efficient student models, our preliminary
study reveals that naively integrating diverse types of distilled knowledge
from teacher LLMs into student LLMs leads to knowledge conflict, negatively
impacting the performance of bundle generation. To address this, we propose
RouteDK, a framework for routing distilled knowledge through a mixture of LoRA
expert architecture. Specifically, we first distill knowledge from the teacher
LLM for bundle generation in two complementary types: high-level knowledge
(generalizable rules) and fine-grained knowledge (session-specific reasoning).
We then train knowledge-specific LoRA experts for each type of knowledge
together with a base LoRA expert. For effective integration, we propose a
dynamic fusion module, featuring an input-aware router, where the router
balances expert contributions by dynamically determining optimal weights based
on input, thereby effectively mitigating knowledge conflicts. To further
improve inference reliability, we design an inference-time enhancement module
to reduce variance and mitigate suboptimal reasoning. Experiments on three
public datasets show that our RouteDK achieves accuracy comparable to or even
better than the teacher LLM, while maintaining strong computational efficiency.
In addition, it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for bundle generation.

Conclusion: CFD-Prompting通过弱化偏差影响，有助于提升LLMs在复杂知识推理任务中的性能和稳健性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in natural
language processing but still struggle to perform well on knowledge-intensive
tasks that require deep reasoning and the integration of external knowledge.
Although methods such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have been proposed to enhance LLMs with external
knowledge, they still suffer from internal bias in LLMs, which often leads to
incorrect answers. In this paper, we propose a novel causal prompting
framework, Conditional Front-Door Prompting (CFD-Prompting), which enables the
unbiased estimation of the causal effect between the query and the answer,
conditional on external knowledge, while mitigating internal bias. By
constructing counterfactual external knowledge, our framework simulates how the
query behaves under varying contexts, addressing the challenge that the query
is fixed and is not amenable to direct causal intervention. Compared to the
standard front-door adjustment, the conditional variant operates under weaker
assumptions, enhancing both robustness and generalisability of the reasoning
process. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmark datasets
demonstrate that CFD-Prompting significantly outperforms existing baselines in
both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: 本研究展示了在缺乏标注数据时，利用大模型和不标注技术实现细粒度情感分析的潜力。

Abstract: Aspect-category sentiment analysis provides granular insights by identifying
specific themes within product reviews that are associated with particular
opinions. Supervised learning approaches dominate the field. However, data is
scarce and expensive to annotate for new domains. We argue that leveraging
large language models in a zero-shot setting is beneficial where the time and
resources required for dataset annotation are limited. Furthermore, annotation
bias may lead to strong results using supervised methods but transfer poorly to
new domains in contexts that lack annotations and demand reproducibility. In
our work, we propose novel techniques that combine multiple chain-of-thought
agents by leveraging large language models' token-level uncertainty scores. We
experiment with the 3B and 70B+ parameter size variants of Llama and Qwen
models, demonstrating how these approaches can fulfil practical needs and
opening a discussion on how to gauge accuracy in label-scarce conditions.

Conclusion: 情感虚幻是重要安全问题，提出资源与方法确保模型既可信又心理安全。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in emotionally sensitive
interactions, where their simulated empathy can create the illusion of genuine
relational connection. We define this risk as Affective Hallucination, the
production of emotionally immersive responses that foster illusory social
presence despite the model's lack of affective capacity. To systematically
diagnose and mitigate this risk, we introduce AHaBench, a benchmark of 500
mental health-related prompts with expert-informed reference responses,
evaluated along three dimensions: Emotional Enmeshment, Illusion of Presence,
and Fostering Overdependence. We further release AHaPairs, a 5K-instance
preference dataset enabling Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for alignment
with emotionally responsible behavior. Experiments across multiple model
families show that DPO fine-tuning substantially reduces affective
hallucination without degrading core reasoning and knowledge performance.
Human-model agreement analyses confirm that AHaBench reliably captures
affective hallucination, validating it as an effective diagnostic tool. This
work establishes affective hallucination as a distinct safety concern and
provides practical resources for developing LLMs that are not only factually
reliable but also psychologically safe. AHaBench and AHaPairs are accessible
via https://huggingface.co/datasets/o0oMiNGo0o/AHaBench, and code for
fine-tuning and evaluation are in https://github.com/0oOMiNGOo0/AHaBench.

Motivation: 解决现有自动化方法在捕捉法律推理中的不足，特别是在理解法律背景、事实与法律规范的关系方面。

Method: 利用prompt驱动的大语言模型提取法律推理成分，对法律条文参考进行规范化，并通过法律推理本体连接事实、规范与法律应用。

Result: 所构建的法律知识图谱能够完整捕捉法院判决的法律推理结构，显著提高相关法律条文检索的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了法律推理的可解释性与自动化程度，为司法决策辅助提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Court judgments reveal how legal rules have been interpreted and applied to
facts, providing a foundation for understanding structured legal reasoning.
However, existing automated approaches for capturing legal reasoning, including
large language models, often fail to identify the relevant legal context, do
not accurately trace how facts relate to legal norms, and may misrepresent the
layered structure of judicial reasoning. These limitations hinder the ability
to capture how courts apply the law to facts in practice. In this paper, we
address these challenges by constructing a legal knowledge graph from 648
Japanese administrative court decisions. Our method extracts components of
legal reasoning using prompt-based large language models, normalizes references
to legal provisions, and links facts, norms, and legal applications through an
ontology of legal inference. The resulting graph captures the full structure of
legal reasoning as it appears in real court decisions, making implicit
reasoning explicit and machine-readable. We evaluate our system using expert
annotated data, and find that it achieves more accurate retrieval of relevant
legal provisions from facts than large language model baselines and
retrieval-augmented methods.

Method: 提出Knowledge-guided Probing（KnowProb）方法，通过六种潜在解释 probing模型理解。

Result: 验证表明模型主要学习单一分布，难以捕捉隐含知识。该方法有效识别模型局限，促进可解释性研究。

Conclusion: KnowProb能揭示模型在理解隐含知识方面的不足，为模型改进和可信度增强提供工具。

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are trained on large amounts of unlabeled
data, yet they exhibit remarkable reasoning skills. However, the
trustworthiness challenges posed by these black-box models have become
increasingly evident in recent years. To alleviate this problem, this paper
proposes a novel Knowledge-guided Probing approach called KnowProb in a
post-hoc explanation way, which aims to probe whether black-box PLMs understand
implicit knowledge beyond the given text, rather than focusing only on the
surface level content of the text. We provide six potential explanations
derived from the underlying content of the given text, including three
knowledge-based understanding and three association-based reasoning. In
experiments, we validate that current small-scale (or large-scale) PLMs only
learn a single distribution of representation, and still face significant
challenges in capturing the hidden knowledge behind a given text. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective for identifying the
limitations of existing black-box models from multiple probing perspectives,
which facilitates researchers to promote the study of detecting black-box
models in an explainable way.

Method: 对5家组织发布的6个最新LLM开发项目的公开文档进行审计和分析。

Result: 详细记录了各项目的价值设定和数据使用实践，同时总结了不同项目的共性和差异。

Conclusion: 强调了对齐策略中价值和数据的关键作用，并提出相关的社会技术挑战。

Abstract: AI Alignment, primarily in the form of Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF), has been a cornerstone of the post-training phase in
developing Large Language Models (LLMs). It has also been a popular research
topic across various disciplines beyond Computer Science, including Philosophy
and Law, among others, highlighting the socio-technical challenges involved.
Nonetheless, except for the computational techniques related to alignment,
there has been limited focus on the broader picture: the scope of these
processes, which primarily rely on the selected objectives (values), and the
data collected and used to imprint such objectives into the models. This work
aims to reveal how alignment is understood and applied in practice from a
value-setting and data-centric perspective. For this purpose, we investigate
and survey (`audit') publicly available documentation released by 6 LLM
development initiatives by 5 leading organizations shaping this technology,
focusing on proprietary (OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini) and
open-weight (Meta's Llama, Google's Gemma, and Alibaba's Qwen) initiatives, all
published in the last 3 years. The findings are documented in detail per
initiative, while there is also an overall summary concerning different
aspects, mainly from a value-setting and data-centric perspective. On the basis
of our findings, we discuss a series of broader related concerns.

Motivation: 解决自动事实核查系统中的claim归一化问题，提升不同语言环境下的准确性。

Method: 采用检索优先、由大规模语言模型支持的流程，通过动态提示GPT-4o-mini或直接检索训练集中的规范化结果，进行claim归一化。

Result: 在官方测试集上达到较优排名，13种语言中7种获得第一，但在零样本条件下表现较差，反映出方案的局限性。

Conclusion: 所提出的检索+大模型流程在多语言claim归一化中效果良好，但需改进以应对零样本场景。

Abstract: Claim normalization is an integral part of any automatic fact-check
verification system. It parses the typically noisy claim data, such as social
media posts into normalized claims, which are then fed into downstream veracity
classification tasks. The CheckThat! 2025 Task 2 focuses specifically on claim
normalization and spans 20 languages under monolingual and zero-shot
conditions. Our proposed solution consists of a lightweight
\emph{retrieval-first, LLM-backed} pipeline, in which we either dynamically
prompt a GPT-4o-mini with in-context examples, or retrieve the closest
normalization from the train dataset directly. On the official test set, the
system ranks near the top for most monolingual tracks, achieving first place in
7 out of of the 13 languages. In contrast, the system underperforms in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the limitation of the proposed solution.

Abstract: Knowledge gaps and hallucinations are persistent challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), which generate unreliable responses when lacking the
necessary information to fulfill user instructions. Existing approaches, such
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool use, aim to address these
issues by incorporating external knowledge. Yet, they rely on additional models
or services, resulting in complex pipelines, potential error propagation, and
often requiring the model to process a large number of tokens. In this paper,
we present a scalable method that enables LLMs to access external knowledge
without depending on retrievers or auxiliary models. Our approach uses
constrained generation with a pre-built prefix-tree index. Triples from a
Knowledge Graph are verbalized in textual facts, tokenized, and indexed in a
prefix tree for efficient access. During inference, to acquire external
knowledge, the LLM generates facts with constrained generation which allows
only sequences of tokens that form an existing fact. We evaluate our proposal
on Question Answering and show that it scales to large knowledge bases (800
million facts), adapts to domain-specific data, and achieves effective results.
These gains come with minimal generation-time overhead. ReFactX code is

TL;DR: 提出SurveyGen数据集和QUAL-SG框架，评估大规模语言模型在科学文献综述中的表现，发现全自动生成仍存在质量不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏标准化数据集限制了对大语言模型生成科学综述的性能评估，亟需建立统一的评价基础。

Method: 构建大规模科学论文综述数据集及引入质量感知的检索增强生成框架，结合不同人类参与度进行系统评估。

Result: 半自动生成实现部分竞争，但全自动综述存在引用质量低和缺乏批判分析的问题。

Conclusion: 需要进一步提升自动化程度和引文质量，以实现更高水平的科学文献综述自动生成。

Abstract: Automatic survey generation has emerged as a key task in scientific document
processing. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating
survey texts, the lack of standardized evaluation datasets critically hampers
rigorous assessment of their performance against human-written surveys. In this
work, we present SurveyGen, a large-scale dataset comprising over 4,200
human-written surveys across diverse scientific domains, along with 242,143
cited references and extensive quality-related metadata for both the surveys
and the cited papers. Leveraging this resource, we build QUAL-SG, a novel
quality-aware framework for survey generation that enhances the standard
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline by incorporating quality-aware
indicators into literature retrieval to assess and select higher-quality source
papers. Using this dataset and framework, we systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art LLMs under varying levels of human involvement - from fully
automatic generation to human-guided writing. Experimental results and human
evaluations show that while semi-automatic pipelines can achieve partially
competitive outcomes, fully automatic survey generation still suffers from low
citation quality and limited critical analysis.

Method: 构建基于知识图谱的合成多跳问答数据集，利用二维难度矩阵结合生成器和检索器的难度，进行系统评估。

Result: 验证难度指标与错误率的强相关性，证明指标的诊断效用，支持多领域、多模型的性能分析。

Conclusion: 提供了细粒度、多维度的评估框架，为提升RAG系统的多跳推理能力提供了基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are widely adopted in
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, but current evaluations often overlook the
structural complexity and multi-step reasoning required in real-world
scenarios. These benchmarks overlook key factors such as the interaction
between retrieval difficulty and reasoning depth. To address this gap, we
propose \textsc{GRADE}, a novel evaluation framework that models task
difficulty along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) reasoning depth, defined by the
number of inference steps (hops), and (2) semantic distance between the query
and its supporting evidence. We construct a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset from
factual news articles by extracting knowledge graphs and augmenting them
through semantic clustering to recover missing links, allowing us to generate
diverse and difficulty-controlled queries. Central to our framework is a 2D
difficulty matrix that combines generator-side and retriever-side difficulty.
Experiments across multiple domains and models show that error rates strongly
correlate with our difficulty measures, validating their diagnostic utility.
\textsc{GRADE} enables fine-grained analysis of RAG performance and provides a
scalable foundation for evaluating and improving multi-hop reasoning in
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO在LM-RLHF中表现良好但依赖启发式，缺乏理论基础。

Method: 开发KLQ方法，证明其在特定条件下等同于PPO，进行对比测试。

Result: KLQ在两个任务中与PPO性能相当，并在判别性评价中表现更优。

Conclusion: KLQ是一种理论基础更明晰且效果优于PPO的强化学习方法，适用于语言生成任务。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) is an established and effective policy
gradient algorithm used for Language Model Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (LM-RLHF). PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic
motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an
ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we develop a a new action-value RL method for the
LM-RLHF setting, KL-regularised Q-Learning (KLQ). We then show that our method
is equivalent to a version of PPO in a certain specific sense, despite its very
different motivation. Finally, we benchmark KLQ on two key language generation
tasks -- summarisation and single-turn dialogue. We demonstrate that KLQ
performs on-par with PPO at optimising the LM-RLHF objective, and achieves a
consistently higher win-rate against PPO on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations.

Conclusion: 通过利用大语言模型的长远规划能力，显著改善表格理解与复杂问答表现，展现出优越性。

Abstract: Table understanding is key to addressing challenging downstream tasks such as
table-based question answering and fact verification. Recent works have focused
on leveraging Chain-of-Thought and question decomposition to solve complex
questions requiring multiple operations on tables. However, these methods often
suffer from a lack of explicit long-term planning and weak inter-step
connections, leading to miss constraints within questions. In this paper, we
propose leveraging the long-term planning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to enhance table understanding. Our approach enables the execution of a
long-term plan, where the steps are tightly interconnected and serve the
ultimate goal, an aspect that methods based on Chain-of-Thought and question
decomposition lack. In addition, our method effectively minimizes the inclusion
of unnecessary details in the process of solving the next short-term goals, a
limitation of methods based on Chain-of-Thought. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on WikiTableQuestions and TabFact datasets.

Conclusion: 该工作通过提供高质量数据和工具，助力教育评论文本情感分析研究的深入发展，弥补领域数据资源空缺。

Abstract: Every year, most educational institutions seek and receive an enormous volume
of text feedback from students on courses, teaching, and overall experience.
Yet, turning this raw feedback into useful insights is far from
straightforward. It has been a long-standing challenge to adopt automatic
opinion mining solutions for such education review text data due to the content
complexity and low-granularity reporting requirements. Aspect-based Sentiment
Analysis (ABSA) offers a promising solution with its rich, sub-sentence-level
opinion mining capabilities. However, existing ABSA research and resources are
very heavily focused on the commercial domain. In education, they are scarce
and hard to develop due to limited public datasets and strict data protection.
A high-quality, annotated dataset is urgently needed to advance research in
this under-resourced area. In this work, we present EduRABSA (Education Review
ABSA), the first public, annotated ABSA education review dataset that covers
three review subject types (course, teaching staff, university) in the English
language and all main ABSA tasks, including the under-explored implicit aspect
and implicit opinion extraction. We also share ASQE-DPT (Data Processing Tool),
an offline, lightweight, installation-free manual data annotation tool that
generates labelled datasets for comprehensive ABSA tasks from a single-task
annotation. Together, these resources contribute to the ABSA community and
education domain by removing the dataset barrier, supporting research
transparency and reproducibility, and enabling the creation and sharing of
further resources. The dataset, annotation tool, and scripts and statistics for
dataset processing and sampling are available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过增强语义绑定和引入图查询，显著改善表格理解效果，为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Our work addresses the challenges of understanding tables. Existing methods
often struggle with the unpredictable nature of table content, leading to a
reliance on preprocessing and keyword matching. They also face limitations due
to the lack of contextual information, which complicates the reasoning
processes of large language models (LLMs). To overcome these challenges, we
introduce an entity-oriented search method to improve table understanding with
LLMs. This approach effectively leverages the semantic similarities between
questions and table data, as well as the implicit relationships between table
cells, minimizing the need for data preprocessing and keyword matching.
Additionally, it focuses on table entities, ensuring that table cells are
semantically tightly bound, thereby enhancing contextual clarity. Furthermore,
we pioneer the use of a graph query language for table understanding,
establishing a new research direction. Experiments show that our approach
achieves new state-of-the-art performances on standard benchmarks

Abstract: We address the problem of data scarcity in harmful text classification for
guardrailing applications and introduce GRAID (Geometric and Reflective
AI-Driven Data Augmentation), a novel pipeline that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for dataset augmentation. GRAID consists of two stages: (i)
generation of geometrically controlled examples using a constrained LLM, and
(ii) augmentation through a multi-agentic reflective process that promotes
stylistic diversity and uncovers edge cases. This combination enables both
reliable coverage of the input space and nuanced exploration of harmful
content. Using two benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that augmenting a
harmful text classification dataset with GRAID leads to significant
improvements in downstream guardrail model performance.

Abstract: The current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in
improving performance on low-resource languages and urgently need
data-efficient methods without costly fine-tuning. From the perspective of
language-bridge, we propose BridgeX-ICL, a simple yet effective method to
improve zero-shot Cross-lingual In-Context Learning (X-ICL) for low-resource
languages. Unlike existing works focusing on language-specific neurons,
BridgeX-ICL explores whether sharing neurons can improve cross-lingual
performance in LLMs or not. We construct neuron probe data from the
ground-truth MUSE bilingual dictionaries, and define a subset of language
overlap neurons accordingly, to ensure full activation of these anchored
neurons. Subsequently, we propose an HSIC-based metric to quantify LLMs'
internal linguistic spectrum based on overlap neurons, which guides optimal
bridge selection. The experiments conducted on 2 cross-lingual tasks and 15
language pairs from 7 diverse families (covering both high-low and moderate-low
pairs) validate the effectiveness of BridgeX-ICL and offer empirical insights
into the underlying multilingual mechanisms of LLMs.

Abstract: This paper investigates token homogenization - the convergence of token
representations toward uniformity across transformer layers and its
relationship to positional bias in large language models. We empirically
examine whether homogenization occurs and how positional bias amplifies this
effect. Through layer-wise similarity analysis and controlled experiments, we
demonstrate that tokens systematically lose distinctiveness during processing,
particularly when biased toward extremal positions. Our findings confirm both
the existence of homogenization and its dependence on positional attention
mechanisms.

Conclusion: 本研究提出的方法在关系判定任务中展现出优越性能，具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Finding the relationships between sentences in a document is crucial for
tasks like fact-checking, argument mining, and text summarization. A key
challenge is to identify which sentences act as premises or contradictions for
a specific claim. Existing methods often face a trade-off: transformer
attention mechanisms can identify salient textual connections but lack explicit
semantic labels, while Natural Language Inference (NLI) models can classify
relationships between sentence pairs but operate independently of contextual
saliency. In this work, we introduce a method that combines the strengths of
both approaches for a targeted analysis. Our pipeline first identifies
candidate sentences that are contextually relevant to a user-selected target
sentence by aggregating token-level attention scores. It then uses a pretrained
NLI model to classify each candidate as a premise (entailment) or
contradiction. By filtering NLI-identified relationships with attention-based
saliency scores, our method efficiently isolates the most significant semantic
relationships for any given claim in a text.

Conclusion: 地理信息的引入增强了自监督模型对语言内变异的识别能力，促进多语言识别的准确性和稳健性。

Abstract: While Self-supervised Learning (SSL) has significantly improved Spoken
Language Identification (LID), existing models often struggle to consistently
classify dialects and accents of the same language as a unified class. To
address this challenge, we propose geolocation-aware LID, a novel approach that
incorporates language-level geolocation information into the SSL-based LID
model. Specifically, we introduce geolocation prediction as an auxiliary task
and inject the predicted vectors into intermediate representations as
conditioning signals. This explicit conditioning encourages the model to learn
more unified representations for dialectal and accented variations. Experiments
across six multilingual datasets demonstrate that our approach improves
robustness to intra-language variations and unseen domains, achieving new
state-of-the-art accuracy on FLEURS (97.7%) and 9.7% relative improvement on
ML-SUPERB 2.0 dialect set.

Abstract: Efforts to apply transformer-based language models (TLMs) to the problem of
reasoning in natural language have enjoyed ever-increasing success in recent
years. The most fundamental task in this area to which nearly all others can be
reduced is that of determining satisfiability. However, from a logical point of
view, satisfiability problems vary along various dimensions, which may affect
TLMs' ability to learn how to solve them. The problem instances of
satisfiability in natural language can belong to different computational
complexity classes depending on the language fragment in which they are
expressed. Although prior research has explored the problem of natural language
satisfiability, the above-mentioned point has not been discussed adequately.
Hence, we investigate how problem instances from varying computational
complexity classes and having different grammatical constructs impact TLMs'
ability to learn rules of inference. Furthermore, to faithfully evaluate TLMs,
we conduct an empirical study to explore the distribution of satisfiability
problems.

Abstract: Results reported in large-scale multilingual evaluations are often fragmented
and confounded by factors such as target languages, differences in experimental
setups, and model choices. We propose a framework that disentangles these
confounding variables and introduces three interpretable metrics--the
performance realisation ratio, its coefficient of variation, and language
potential--enabling a finer-grained and more insightful quantification of
actual performance disparities across both (i) models and (ii) languages.
Through a case study of 13 model variants on 11 multilingual datasets, we
demonstrate that our framework provides a more reliable measurement of model
performance and language disparities, particularly for low-resource languages,
which have so far proven challenging to evaluate. Importantly, our results
reveal that higher overall model performance does not necessarily imply greater
fairness across languages.

Method: 通过将LLMs生成的标签与传统标注技术进行比较，考察其在不同人格角色设定（如人口统计属性）下的表现，分析其在强与弱数据视角中的应用效果。

Result: LLMs能选择性地利用人物设定中的人口统计特征，表现出与不同标注者原始人设的对齐差异。在弱数据视角下，不依赖具体标注者信息的模型表现优于依赖信息的模型，显示其偏向于集成观点；在强数据视角下，LLM的表现虽逼近人类，但未超过人类。

Conclusion: LLMs在多视角标注任务中具有潜力，尤其是在弱数据视角中表现优良，但在高度个性化的强视角任务中仍需进一步优化以匹敌人类标注者。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
annotate hate speech and abusiveness while considering predefined annotator
personas within the strong-to-weak data perspectivism spectra. We evaluated
LLM-generated annotations against existing annotator modeling techniques for
perspective modeling. Our findings show that LLMs selectively use demographic
attributes from the personas. We identified prototypical annotators, with
persona features that show varying degrees of alignment with the original human
annotators. Within the data perspectivism paradigm, annotator modeling
techniques that do not explicitly rely on annotator information performed
better under weak data perspectivism compared to both strong data perspectivism
and human annotations, suggesting LLM-generated views tend towards aggregation
despite subjective prompting. However, for more personalized datasets tailored
to strong perspectivism, the performance of LLM annotator modeling approached,
but did not exceed, human annotators.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is a pivotal technique for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human intentions, safety constraints, and domain-specific
requirements. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the full
pipeline, encompassing (i) data collection methodologies, (ii) full-parameter
and parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies, and (iii) evaluation protocols.
We categorized data construction into three major paradigms: expert annotation,
distillation from larger models, and self-improvement mechanisms, each offering
distinct trade-offs between quality, scalability, and resource cost.
Fine-tuning techniques range from conventional supervised training to
lightweight approaches, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and prefix tuning,
with a focus on computational efficiency and model reusability. We further
examine the challenges of evaluating faithfulness, utility, and safety across
multilingual and multimodal scenarios, highlighting the emergence of
domain-specific benchmarks in healthcare, legal, and financial applications.
Finally, we discuss promising directions for automated data generation,
adaptive optimization, and robust evaluation frameworks, arguing that a closer
integration of data, algorithms, and human feedback is essential for advancing
instruction-tuned LLMs. This survey aims to serve as a practical reference for
researchers and practitioners seeking to design LLMs that are both effective
and reliably aligned with human intentions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive level of general
knowledge. However, they often struggle in highly specialized and
cost-sensitive domains such as drug discovery and rare disease research due to
the lack of expert knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
(PU-ADKA) designed to efficiently enhance domain-specific LLMs by actively
engaging domain experts within a fixed budget. Unlike traditional fine-tuning
approaches, PU-ADKA selectively identifies and queries the most appropriate
expert from a team, taking into account each expert's availability, knowledge
boundaries, and consultation costs. We train PU-ADKA using simulations on
PubMed data and validate it through both controlled expert interactions and
real-world deployment with a drug development team, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LLM performance in specialized domains under strict
budget constraints. In addition to outlining our methodological innovations and
experimental results, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, CKAD, for
cost-effective LLM domain knowledge acquisition to foster further research in
this challenging area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RAG系统在保证答案可信性方面面临的昂贵标注和推理负担问题。

Method: 通过对比模型在有无上下文情况下的输出生成，构建偏好数据对，结合直接偏好优化进行模型对齐，利用Likelihood Displacement理论引导模型向上下文一致的答案偏移。

Result: SSFO在多个问答数据集上显著优于现有方法，达到最优的答案可信性，同时具备良好的跨语言和指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: 引入自监督偏好优化有效改善RAG系统的可信性，提供一种高效、无需额外监督的模型优化路径。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate responses that are faithful to the retrieved context.
However, faithfulness hallucination remains a critical challenge, as existing
methods often require costly supervision and post-training or significant
inference burdens. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Self-Supervised
Faithfulness Optimization (SSFO), the first self-supervised alignment approach
for enhancing RAG faithfulness. SSFO constructs preference data pairs by
contrasting the model's outputs generated with and without the context.
Leveraging Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), SSFO aligns model faithfulness
without incurring labeling costs or additional inference burden. We
theoretically and empirically demonstrate that SSFO leverages a benign form of
\emph{likelihood displacement}, transferring probability mass from
parametric-based tokens to context-aligned tokens. Based on this insight, we
propose a modified DPO loss function to encourage likelihood displacement.
Comprehensive evaluations show that SSFO significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness on multiple context-based
question-answering datasets. Notably, SSFO exhibits strong generalization,
improving cross-lingual faithfulness and preserving general
instruction-following capabilities. We release our code and model at the

Result: 发现现有模型在事实性和表达清晰度方面存在不足，强调需要专门针对法律索赔生成的模型开发。

Conclusion: 将公开数据集以促使未来研究，推动法律辅助技术的发展。

Abstract: Legal claims refer to the plaintiff's demands in a case and are essential to
guiding judicial reasoning and case resolution. While many works have focused
on improving the efficiency of legal professionals, the research on helping
non-professionals (e.g., plaintiffs) remains unexplored. This paper explores
the problem of legal claim generation based on the given case's facts. First,
we construct ClaimGen-CN, the first dataset for Chinese legal claim generation
task, from various real-world legal disputes. Additionally, we design an
evaluation metric tailored for assessing the generated claims, which
encompasses two essential dimensions: factuality and clarity. Building on this,
we conduct a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art general and
legal-domain large language models. Our findings highlight the limitations of
the current models in factual precision and expressive clarity, pointing to the
need for more targeted development in this domain. To encourage further
exploration of this important task, we will make the dataset publicly
available.

Abstract: The pursuit of human-level artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly
advanced the development of autonomous agents and Large Language Models (LLMs).
LLMs are now widely utilized as decision-making agents for their ability to
interpret instructions, manage sequential tasks, and adapt through feedback.
This review examines recent developments in employing LLMs as autonomous agents
and tool users and comprises seven research questions. We only used the papers
published between 2023 and 2025 in conferences of the A* and A rank and Q1
journals. A structured analysis of the LLM agents' architectural design
principles, dividing their applications into single-agent and multi-agent
systems, and strategies for integrating external tools is presented. In
addition, the cognitive mechanisms of LLM, including reasoning, planning, and
memory, and the impact of prompting methods and fine-tuning procedures on agent
performance are also investigated. Furthermore, we evaluated current benchmarks
and assessment protocols and have provided an analysis of 68 publicly available
datasets to assess the performance of LLM-based agents in various tasks. In
conducting this review, we have identified critical findings on verifiable
reasoning of LLMs, the capacity for self-improvement, and the personalization
of LLM-based agents. Finally, we have discussed ten future research directions
to overcome these gaps.

Abstract: Interactive online learning environments, represented by Massive AI-empowered
Courses (MAIC), leverage LLM-driven multi-agent systems to transform passive
MOOCs into dynamic, text-based platforms, enhancing interactivity through LLMs.
This paper conducts an empirical study on a specific MAIC course to explore
three research questions about dropouts in these interactive online courses:
(1) What factors might lead to dropouts? (2) Can we predict dropouts? (3) Can
we reduce dropouts? We analyze interaction logs to define dropouts and identify
contributing factors. Our findings reveal strong links between dropout
behaviors and textual interaction patterns. We then propose a
course-progress-adaptive dropout prediction framework (CPADP) to predict
dropouts with at most 95.4% accuracy. Based on this, we design a personalized
email recall agent to re-engage at-risk students. Applied in the deployed MAIC
system with over 3,000 students, the feasibility and effectiveness of our
approach have been validated on students with diverse backgrounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补低秩更新在微调中的性能差距，提升模型在下游任务中的表现。

Method: 在LoRA的两个低秩矩阵之间引入剪枝模块，实现动态子空间学习，突破静态子空间限制。

Result: 实验显示DropLoRA在多任务中优于传统LoRA，提升模型微调效果。

Conclusion: DropLoRA是一种有效的参数高效微调方法，无需增加额外成本，提高了LLaMA系列模型的性能。

Abstract: LoRA-based large model parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods use
low-rank de- composition to approximate updates to model parameters. However,
compared to full- parameter fine-tuning, low-rank updates often lead to a
performance gap in downstream tasks. To address this, we introduce DropLoRA, a
novel pruning-based approach that focuses on pruning the rank dimension. Unlike
conven- tional methods that attempt to overcome the low-rank bottleneck,
DropLoRA innovatively integrates a pruning module between the two low-rank
matrices in LoRA to simulate dy- namic subspace learning. This dynamic low-
rank subspace learning allows DropLoRA to overcome the limitations of
traditional LoRA, which operates within a static subspace. By continuously
adapting the learning subspace, DropLoRA significantly boosts performance
without incurring additional training or infer- ence costs. Our experimental
results demon- strate that DropLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA in
fine-tuning the LLaMA series across a wide range of large language model gener-
ation tasks, including commonsense reason- ing, mathematical reasoning, code
generation, and instruction-following. Our code is avail- able at

*Sanad Shaban,Nizar Habash*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种新的阿拉伯语词汇普遍性得分（AGS），补充现有的ALDi模型，更好地刻画方言的复杂变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NLP模型将阿拉伯方言视为离散类别，忽视其连续和复杂的变化。需要更细粒度、 linguistically grounded 的衡量指标。

Method: 结合词对齐、词源相关的编辑距离和光滑技术，注释平行语料中的词汇AGS，并训练回归模型预测上下文中的AGS值，从而提升方言识别性能。

Result: 该方法在多方言基准测试中优于现有基线和最先进的方言识别系统，验证了AGS的有效性。

Conclusion: AGS作为一种具有语言学基础的可扩展指标，有助于丰富阿拉伯语方言的表征，改善方言识别模型的精细度。

Abstract: Arabic dialects form a diverse continuum, yet NLP models often treat them as
discrete categories. Recent work addresses this issue by modeling dialectness
as a continuous variable, notably through the Arabic Level of Dialectness
(ALDi). However, ALDi reduces complex variation to a single dimension. We
propose a complementary measure: the Arabic Generality Score (AGS), which
quantifies how widely a word is used across dialects. We introduce a pipeline
that combines word alignment, etymology-aware edit distance, and smoothing to
annotate a parallel corpus with word-level AGS. A regression model is then
trained to predict AGS in context. Our approach outperforms strong baselines,
including state-of-the-art dialect ID systems, on a multi-dialect benchmark.
AGS offers a scalable, linguistically grounded way to model lexical generality,
enriching representations of Arabic dialectness.

TL;DR: ALLaM-34B是一款高性能的阿拉伯语大型语言模型，在多任务、多方言和安全性方面表现出色，具备实际应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补英美语料偏重导致阿拉伯语模型性能不足的不足，提升阿拉伯语的理解和生成能力。

Method: 通过设计多样化的提示包，利用多个前沿大模型评估ALLaM-34B的各种能力，并分析其在不同任务和方言上的表现。

Result: ALLaM-34B在生成、代码切换、现代标准阿拉伯语理解、推理、方言忠实度和安全性方面均表现优异，表现稳定可靠。

Conclusion: ALLaM-34B展现出强大的技术实力和文化适应性，适合实际部署，推动阿拉伯语AI技术的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained primarily on English corpora often
struggle to capture the linguistic and cultural nuances of Arabic. To address
this gap, the Saudi Data and AI Authority (SDAIA) introduced the $ALLaM$ family
of Arabic-focused models. The most capable of these available to the public,
$ALLaM-34B$, was subsequently adopted by HUMAIN, who developed and deployed
HUMAIN Chat, a closed conversational web service built on this model. This
paper presents an expanded and refined UI-level evaluation of $ALLaM-34B$.
Using a prompt pack spanning modern standard Arabic, five regional dialects,
code-switching, factual knowledge, arithmetic and temporal reasoning, creative
generation, and adversarial safety, we collected 115 outputs (23 prompts times
5 runs) and scored each with three frontier LLM judges (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro,
Claude Sonnet-4). We compute category-level means with 95\% confidence
intervals, analyze score distributions, and visualize dialect-wise metric heat
maps. The updated analysis reveals consistently high performance on generation
and code-switching tasks (both averaging 4.92/5), alongside strong results in
MSA handling (4.74/5), solid reasoning ability (4.64/5), and improved dialect
fidelity (4.21/5). Safety-related prompts show stable, reliable performance of
(4.54/5). Taken together, these results position $ALLaM-34B$ as a robust and
culturally grounded Arabic LLM, demonstrating both technical strength and
practical readiness for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 当前对大模型的评估依赖静态基准和少量人类测试，难以全面反映模型实际能力。

Method: 结合静态代码分析、设计师问询、文献挖掘和人格驱动的对抗性测试，利用LLM作为评审，通过反馈调整测试难度。

Result: 在旅游规划和维基写作任务中，ATA发现比专家更丰富的失败样例，测试效率显著提升，提供量化指标和缺陷报告。

Conclusion: 多策略结合的动态测试方式可有效提升模型评估的丰富性和实用性，为模型开发者提供有价值的反馈，且已开源便于复现。

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed to plan, retrieve, and write with tools,
yet evaluation still leans on static benchmarks and small human studies. We
present the Agent-Testing Agent (ATA), a meta-agent that combines static code
analysis, designer interrogation, literature mining, and persona-driven
adversarial test generation whose difficulty adapts via judge feedback. Each
dialogue is scored with an LLM-as-a-Judge (LAAJ) rubric and used to steer
subsequent tests toward the agent's weakest capabilities. On a travel planner
and a Wikipedia writer, the ATA surfaces more diverse and severe failures than
expert annotators while matching severity, and finishes in 20--30 minutes
versus ten-annotator rounds that took days. Ablating code analysis and web
search increases variance and miscalibration, underscoring the value of
evidence-grounded test generation. The ATA outputs quantitative metrics and
qualitative bug reports for developers. We release the full methodology and
open-source implementation for reproducible agent testing:

TL;DR: 新的DashboardQA基准测试评估视觉-语言GUI代理在交互式仪表盘理解与操作中的能力，显示其在元素识别、互动规划和推理方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着仪表盘在数据决策中的广泛应用，评估基于GUI的多模态代理的能力变得迫切，但现有基准未考虑交互性。

Method: 设计包含112个交互式仪表盘和405个问答对的基准，评估多种GUI代理的表现，重点分析其在元素定位、交互规划和推理中的不足。

Result: 所有模型表现有限，最佳代理准确率仅38.69%，揭示交互式仪表盘理解的复杂性和挑战。

Conclusion: DashboardQA为未来开发更强大的GUI代理提供了基准，强调了改进元素理解与交互策略的重要性。

Abstract: Dashboards are powerful visualization tools for data-driven decision-making,
integrating multiple interactive views that allow users to explore, filter, and
navigate data. Unlike static charts, dashboards support rich interactivity,
which is essential for uncovering insights in real-world analytical workflows.
However, existing question-answering benchmarks for data visualizations largely
overlook this interactivity, focusing instead on static charts. This limitation
severely constrains their ability to evaluate the capabilities of modern
multimodal agents designed for GUI-based reasoning. To address this gap, we
introduce DashboardQA, the first benchmark explicitly designed to assess how
vision-language GUI agents comprehend and interact with real-world dashboards.
The benchmark includes 112 interactive dashboards from Tableau Public and 405
question-answer pairs with interactive dashboards spanning five categories:
multiple-choice, factoid, hypothetical, multi-dashboard, and conversational. By
assessing a variety of leading closed- and open-source GUI agents, our analysis
reveals their key limitations, particularly in grounding dashboard elements,
planning interaction trajectories, and performing reasoning. Our findings
indicate that interactive dashboard reasoning is a challenging task overall for
all the VLMs evaluated. Even the top-performing agents struggle; for instance,
the best agent based on Gemini-Pro-2.5 achieves only 38.69% accuracy, while the
OpenAI CUA agent reaches just 22.69%, demonstrating the benchmark's significant
difficulty. We release DashboardQA at https://github.com/vis-nlp/DashboardQA

Method: 引入DuET-PD框架评估模型在说服类型和领域上的多轮对话表现，结合Holistic DPO训练方法，平衡正负说服示例，提高模型抗误导能力和修正能力。

Result: 即使是先进模型如GPT-4o在持续误导中表现也较差（准确率27.32%），新方法显著提升Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct在安全场景中的抗误导能力，从4.21%到76.54%。

Conclusion: 提出的评估框架和训练策略有助于开发更加可靠和适应性强的多轮对话LLMs，有助于应对实际应用中的误导信息和修正需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can struggle to balance gullibility to
misinformation and resistance to valid corrections in persuasive dialogues, a
critical challenge for reliable deployment. We introduce DuET-PD (Dual
Evaluation for Trust in Persuasive Dialogues), a framework evaluating
multi-turn stance-change dynamics across dual dimensions: persuasion type
(corrective/misleading) and domain (knowledge via MMLU-Pro, and safety via
SALAD-Bench). We find that even a state-of-the-art model like GPT-4o achieves
only 27.32% accuracy in MMLU-Pro under sustained misleading persuasions.
Moreover, results reveal a concerning trend of increasing sycophancy in newer
open-source models. To address this, we introduce Holistic DPO, a training
approach balancing positive and negative persuasion examples. Unlike prompting
or resist-only training, Holistic DPO enhances both robustness to
misinformation and receptiveness to corrections, improving
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct's accuracy under misleading persuasion in safety contexts
from 4.21% to 76.54%. These contributions offer a pathway to developing more
reliable and adaptable LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多词表达在机器翻译中的难题，提升翻译质量。

Method: 分析三类VMWE对翻译的影响，并提出LLM改写方法。

Result: VMWE影响翻译效果，LLM替换显著改善表现。

Conclusion: 应用语言模型进行表达转换，有助提升多词表达的机器翻译效果。

Abstract: Verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs) present significant challenges for
natural language processing due to their complex and often non-compositional
nature. While machine translation models have seen significant improvement with
the advent of language models in recent years, accurately translating these
complex linguistic structures remains an open problem. In this study, we
analyze the impact of three VMWE categories -- verbal idioms, verb-particle
constructions, and light verb constructions -- on machine translation quality
from English to multiple languages. Using both established multiword expression
datasets and sentences containing these language phenomena extracted from
machine translation datasets, we evaluate how state-of-the-art translation
systems handle these expressions. Our experimental results consistently show
that VMWEs negatively affect translation quality. We also propose an LLM-based
paraphrasing approach that replaces these expressions with their literal
counterparts, demonstrating significant improvement in translation quality for
verbal idioms and verb-particle constructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在长文分类中存在输入长度和计算效率问题，需寻找解决方案。

Method: 采用基于TF-IDF的句子排序策略，选取最具信息量的句子用于分类，未改变模型结构。

Result: 在MahaNews数据集上，保留前50%的句子，性能与完整文档一致，推理时间减少35%。

Conclusion: 句子排序技术简便高效，适合扩展Transformer模型到长文分类，提升系统规模化能力。

Abstract: Transformer-based models like BERT excel at short text classification but
struggle with long document classification (LDC) due to input length
limitations and computational inefficiencies. In this work, we propose an
efficient, zero-shot approach to LDC that leverages sentence ranking to reduce
input context without altering the model architecture. Our method enables the
adaptation of models trained on short texts, such as headlines, to long-form
documents by selecting the most informative sentences using a TF-IDF-based
ranking strategy. Using the MahaNews dataset of long Marathi news articles, we
evaluate three context reduction strategies that prioritize essential content
while preserving classification accuracy. Our results show that retaining only
the top 50\% ranked sentences maintains performance comparable to full-document

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升商用TTS系统中合成语音的表达能力，克服现有系统中韵味控制不足的问题。

Method: 采用两个微调的Qwen 2.5-7B模型进行级联预测，插入SSML标签，控制韵律参数。

Result: 在法语播客语料上实现高准确率的停顿预测和韵律参数的准确调节，显著提升语音自然性和听感偏好。

Conclusion: 提出的端到端流程有效增强了法语合成语音的表达力，缩小了与自然语音的差距。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, synthetic voices often lack expressiveness due to
limited prosody control in commercial text-to-speech (TTS) systems. We
introduce the first end-to-end pipeline that inserts Speech Synthesis Markup
Language (SSML) tags into French text to control pitch, speaking rate, volume,
and pause duration. We employ a cascaded architecture with two QLoRA-fine-tuned
Qwen 2.5-7B models: one predicts phrase-break positions and the other performs
regression on prosodic targets, generating commercial TTS-compatible SSML
markup. Evaluated on a 14-hour French podcast corpus, our method achieves 99.2%
F1 for break placement and reduces mean absolute error on pitch, rate, and
volume by 25-40% compared with prompting-only large language models (LLMs) and
a BiLSTM baseline. In perceptual evaluation involving 18 participants across
over 9 hours of synthesized audio, SSML-enhanced speech generated by our
pipeline significantly improves naturalness, with the mean opinion score
increasing from 3.20 to 3.87 (p < 0.005). Additionally, 15 of 18 listeners
preferred our enhanced synthesis. These results demonstrate substantial
progress in bridging the expressiveness gap between synthetic and natural
French speech. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 理解MAD中各组成部分对性能的贡献，为提升多智能体协作策略提供理论依据。

Method: 将MAD拆解为多数投票和辩论两部分，进行大规模实验，并建立一个模型辩论为随机过程的理论框架，分析其效果。

Result: 多数投票单独已能解释大部分性能提升，辩论机制不一定提高正确率，但经过偏向校正的干预能增强效果。

Conclusion: MAD的潜力存在，但简单的投票集成方法在实际中更为稳妥和有效，未来应关注机制中的偏向性干预。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Debate~(MAD) has emerged as a promising paradigm for improving
the performance of large language models through collaborative reasoning.
Despite recent advances, the key factors driving MAD's effectiveness remain
unclear. In this work, we disentangle MAD into two key components--Majority
Voting and inter-agent Debate--and assess their respective contributions.
Through extensive experiments across seven NLP benchmarks, we find that
Majority Voting alone accounts for most of the performance gains typically
attributed to MAD. To explain this, we propose a theoretical framework that
models debate as a stochastic process. We prove that it induces a martingale
over agents' belief trajectories, implying that debate alone does not improve
expected correctness. Guided by these insights, we demonstrate that targeted
interventions, by biasing the belief update toward correction, can meaningfully
enhance debate effectiveness. Overall, our findings suggest that while MAD has
potential, simple ensembling methods remain strong and more reliable
alternatives in many practical settings. Code is released in

Conclusion: 将拟人化视为设计元素，通过元素的调控实现目标导向的交互优化，为人机交互设计提供新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit \textbf{anthropomorphism}
characteristics -- human-like qualities portrayed across their outlook,
language, behavior, and reasoning functions. Such characteristics enable more
intuitive and engaging human-AI interactions. However, current research on
anthropomorphism remains predominantly risk-focused, emphasizing over-trust and
user deception while offering limited design guidance. We argue that
anthropomorphism should instead be treated as a \emph{concept of design} that
can be intentionally tuned to support user goals. Drawing from multiple
disciplines, we propose that the anthropomorphism of an LLM-based artifact
should reflect the interaction between artifact designers and interpreters.
This interaction is facilitated by cues embedded in the artifact by the
designers and the (cognitive) responses of the interpreters to the cues. Cues
are categorized into four dimensions: \textit{perceptive, linguistic,
behavioral}, and \textit{cognitive}. By analyzing the manifestation and
effectiveness of each cue, we provide a unified taxonomy with actionable levers
for practitioners. Consequently, we advocate for function-oriented evaluations
of anthropomorphic design.

Motivation: 尽管最新的NLP模型性能优异，但其决策过程仍是黑箱，亟需提高可解释性，理解文本特征的因果作用。

Method: 开发基于双头RieszNet的神经网络架构CausalSent，结合因果推断方法，准确估计治疗效果。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升文本模型的可解释性，为理解文本特征的因果作用提供了新工具，有助于透明化和改进NLP模型。

Abstract: Despite the overwhelming performance improvements offered by recent natural
language procesing (NLP) models, the decisions made by these models are largely
a black box. Towards closing this gap, the field of causal NLP combines causal
inference literature with modern NLP models to elucidate causal effects of text
features. We replicate and extend Bansal et al's work on regularizing text
classifiers to adhere to estimated effects, focusing instead on model
interpretability. Specifically, we focus on developing a two-headed
RieszNet-based neural network architecture which achieves better treatment
effect estimation accuracy. Our framework, CausalSent, accurately predicts
treatment effects in semi-synthetic IMDB movie reviews, reducing MAE of effect
estimates by 2-3x compared to Bansal et al's MAE on synthetic Civil Comments
data. With an ensemble of validated models, we perform an observational case
study on the causal effect of the word "love" in IMDB movie reviews, finding
that the presence of the word "love" causes a +2.9% increase in the probability
of a positive sentiment.

Result: 最先进模型仅在15%的问题中通过验证，验证过程中发现部分正确答案，展现了评估平台的潜力和复杂性。

Conclusion: UQ平台为未来AI模型评估提供了更真实、更具有挑战性和实用性的路径，有助推动人类知识的拓展。

Abstract: Benchmarks shape progress in AI research. A useful benchmark should be both
difficult and realistic: questions should challenge frontier models while also
reflecting real-world usage. Yet, current paradigms face a difficulty-realism
tension: exam-style benchmarks are often made artificially difficult with
limited real-world value, while benchmarks based on real user interaction often
skew toward easy, high-frequency problems. In this work, we explore a radically
different paradigm: assessing models on unsolved questions. Rather than a
static benchmark scored once, we curate unsolved questions and evaluate models
asynchronously over time with validator-assisted screening and community
verification. We introduce UQ, a testbed of 500 challenging, diverse questions
sourced from Stack Exchange, spanning topics from CS theory and math to sci-fi
and history, probing capabilities including reasoning, factuality, and
browsing. UQ is difficult and realistic by construction: unsolved questions are
often hard and naturally arise when humans seek answers, thus solving them
yields direct real-world value. Our contributions are threefold: (1) UQ-Dataset
and its collection pipeline combining rule-based filters, LLM judges, and human
review to ensure question quality (e.g., well-defined and difficult); (2)
UQ-Validators, compound validation strategies that leverage the
generator-validator gap to provide evaluation signals and pre-screen candidate
solutions for human review; and (3) UQ-Platform, an open platform where experts
collectively verify questions and solutions. The top model passes UQ-validation
on only 15% of questions, and preliminary human verification has already
identified correct answers among those that passed. UQ charts a path for
evaluating frontier models on real-world, open-ended challenges, where success
pushes the frontier of human knowledge. We release UQ at

Conclusion: HGLA剪枝有望在模型剪枝过程中实现更公平的输出，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Model compression through post-training pruning offers a way to reduce model
size and computational requirements without significantly impacting model
performance. However, the effect of pruning on the fairness of LLM-generated
summaries remains unexplored, particularly for opinion summarisation where
biased outputs could influence public views.In this paper, we present a
comprehensive empirical analysis of opinion summarisation, examining three
state-of-the-art pruning methods and various calibration sets across three
open-source LLMs using four fairness metrics. Our systematic analysis reveals
that pruning methods have a greater impact on fairness than calibration sets.
Building on these insights, we propose High Gradient Low Activation (HGLA)
pruning, which identifies and removes parameters that are redundant for input
processing but influential in output generation. Our experiments demonstrate
that HGLA can better maintain or even improve fairness compared to existing
methods, showing promise across models and tasks where traditional methods have
limitations. Our human evaluation shows HGLA-generated outputs are fairer than
existing state-of-the-art pruning methods. Code is available at:

Motivation: 当前激活调控方法干预范围不够精确，难以有效引导模型行为，亟需更智能的调控机制。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证此方法优于基线模型，有效改善模型生成的真实性和行为一致性。

Conclusion: FASB提供了一种高效、灵活的模型调控方式，为大语言模型行为引导提供新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across many
generation tasks. Nevertheless, effectively aligning them with desired
behaviors remains a significant challenge. Activation steering is an effective
and cost-efficient approach that directly modifies the activations of LLMs
during the inference stage, aligning their responses with the desired behaviors
and avoiding the high cost of fine-tuning. Existing methods typically
indiscriminately intervene to all generations or rely solely on the question to
determine intervention, which limits the accurate assessment of the
intervention strength. To this end, we propose the Flexible Activation Steering
with Backtracking (FASB) framework, which dynamically determines both the
necessity and strength of intervention by tracking the internal states of the
LLMs during generation, considering both the question and the generated
content. Since intervening after detecting a deviation from the desired
behavior is often too late, we further propose the backtracking mechanism to
correct the deviated tokens and steer the LLMs toward the desired behavior.
Extensive experiments on the TruthfulQA dataset and six multiple-choice
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines. Our code will be
released at https://github.com/gjw185/FASB.

Abstract: Speech emotions play a crucial role in human-computer interaction, shaping
engagement and context-aware communication. Despite recent advances in spoken
dialogue systems, a holistic system for evaluating emotional reasoning is still
lacking. To address this, we introduce EMO-Reasoning, a benchmark for assessing
emotional coherence in dialogue systems. It leverages a curated dataset
generated via text-to-speech to simulate diverse emotional states, overcoming
the scarcity of emotional speech data. We further propose the Cross-turn
Emotion Reasoning Score to assess the emotion transitions in multi-turn
dialogues. Evaluating seven dialogue systems through continuous, categorical,
and perceptual metrics, we show that our framework effectively detects
emotional inconsistencies, providing insights for improving current dialogue
systems. By releasing a systematic evaluation benchmark, we aim to advance
emotion-aware spoken dialogue modeling toward more natural and adaptive
interactions.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在复杂推理中过度思考导致资源浪费的问题，提高推理效率与准确性。

Method: 挖掘敏感且一致的RCP表现形式，基于启发式规则设计轻量阈值策略，通过句子检测和终止标记监测实现。

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试上有效降低了令牌消耗，保持甚至提升推理准确性。

Conclusion: 通过优化RCP检测策略，成功缓解LLMs中的过度思考问题，提升推理效率与效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enhance complex reasoning tasks by scaling the
individual thinking process. However, prior work shows that overthinking can
degrade overall performance. Motivated by observed patterns in thinking length
and content length, we categorize reasoning into three stages: insufficient
exploration stage, compensatory reasoning stage, and reasoning convergence
stage. Typically, LLMs produce correct answers in the compensatory reasoning
stage, whereas reasoning convergence often triggers overthinking, causing
increased resource usage or even infinite loops. Therefore, mitigating
overthinking hinges on detecting the end of the compensatory reasoning stage,
defined as the Reasoning Completion Point (RCP). RCP typically appears at the
end of the first complete reasoning cycle and can be identified by querying the
LLM sentence by sentence or monitoring the probability of an end-of-thinking
token (e.g., \texttt{</think>}), though these methods lack an efficient and
precise balance. To improve this, we mine more sensitive and consistent RCP
patterns and develop a lightweight thresholding strategy based on heuristic
rules. Experimental evaluations on benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-D)
demonstrate that the proposed method reduces token consumption while preserving
or enhancing reasoning accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于奖励操控（reward hacking）导致模型过度追求奖励而偏离原始目标，亟需解决此问题以提升LLMs的稳定性和可靠性。

Method: 通过在输出层logits引入KL散度限制和在中间隐藏状态上进行多粒度正交矩阵微调，提出RoPO算法，有效抑制神经元崩塌和表示冗余。

Result: RoPO在AlpacaEval 2和MT-Bench上显著优于基线，提升性能且仅需很少的可训练参数，验证了其在预防奖励操控方面的有效性。

Conclusion: RoPO通过结构化约束策略，有效缓解DPO中的奖励操控问题，同时保持模型的知识储备和表达能力，为LLM训练提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the efficacy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs), reward hacking remains a pivotal challenge. This
issue emerges when LLMs excessively reduce the probability of rejected
completions to achieve high rewards, without genuinely meeting their intended
goals. As a result, this leads to overly lengthy generation lacking diversity,
as well as catastrophic forgetting of knowledge. We investigate the underlying
reason behind this issue, which is representation redundancy caused by neuron
collapse in the parameter space. Hence, we propose a novel Weights-Rotated
Preference Optimization (RoPO) algorithm, which implicitly constrains the
output layer logits with the KL divergence inherited from DPO and explicitly
constrains the intermediate hidden states by fine-tuning on a multi-granularity
orthogonal matrix. This design prevents the policy model from deviating too far
from the reference model, thereby retaining the knowledge and expressive
capabilities acquired during pre-training and SFT stages. Our RoPO achieves up
to a 3.27-point improvement on AlpacaEval 2, and surpasses the best baseline by
6.2 to 7.5 points on MT-Bench with merely 0.015% of the trainable parameters,
demonstrating its effectiveness in alleviating the reward hacking problem of
DPO.

Method: 引入基于信心（如熵差和局部峰值）和分布差异（参数与上下文分布差异）的评估指标，设计CoCoA解码算法，有针对性地调整生成策略。

Result: 在问答、摘要和长文本问答任务中，CoCoA相较强基线如AdaCAD表现优异，提升问答准确率最多达9.2点，摘要和LFQA的忠实性提升最多达2.5点，并且对冲突变化更敏感。

Conclusion: CoCoA是一种有效的策略，用于增强大模型生成的忠实性，具有广泛应用潜力和适应性强的优势。

Abstract: Faithful generation in large language models (LLMs) is challenged by
knowledge conflicts between parametric memory and external context. Existing
contrastive decoding methods tuned specifically to handle conflict often lack
adaptability and can degrade performance in low conflict settings. We introduce
CoCoA (Confidence- and Context-Aware Adaptive Decoding), a novel token-level
algorithm for principled conflict resolution and enhanced faithfulness. CoCoA
resolves conflict by utilizing confidence-aware measures (entropy gap and
contextual peakedness) and the generalized divergence between the parametric
and contextual distributions. Crucially, CoCoA maintains strong performance
even in low conflict settings. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs on
diverse Question Answering (QA), Summarization, and Long-Form Question
Answering (LFQA) benchmarks demonstrate CoCoA's state-of-the-art performance
over strong baselines like AdaCAD. It yields significant gains in QA accuracy,
up to 9.2 points on average compared to the strong baseline AdaCAD, and
improves factuality in summarization and LFQA by up to 2.5 points on average
across key benchmarks. Additionally, it demonstrates superior sensitivity to
conflict variations. CoCoA enables more informed, context-aware, and ultimately
more faithful token generation.

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架和模型增强了文本丰富网络中OOD检测的研究深度，有助于未来开发更鲁棒的检测方法。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains challenging in text-rich
networks, where textual features intertwine with topological structures.
Existing methods primarily address label shifts or rudimentary domain-based
splits, overlooking the intricate textual-structural diversity. For example, in
social networks, where users represent nodes with textual features (name, bio)
while edges indicate friendship status, OOD may stem from the distinct language
patterns between bot and normal users. To address this gap, we introduce the
TextTopoOOD framework for evaluating detection across diverse OOD scenarios:
(1) attribute-level shifts via text augmentations and embedding perturbations;
(2) structural shifts through edge rewiring and semantic connections; (3)
thematically-guided label shifts; and (4) domain-based divisions. Furthermore,
we propose TNT-OOD to model the complex interplay between Text aNd Topology
using: 1) a novel cross-attention module to fuse local structure into
node-level text representations, and 2) a HyperNetwork to generate
node-specific transformation parameters. This aligns topological and semantic
features of ID nodes, enhancing ID/OOD distinction across structural and
textual shifts. Experiments on 11 datasets across four OOD scenarios
demonstrate the nuanced challenge of TextTopoOOD for evaluating OOD detection
in text-rich networks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for downstream tasks such as
tabular classification, where ensuring fairness in their outputs is critical
for inclusivity, equal representation, and responsible AI deployment. This
study introduces a novel approach to enhancing LLM performance and fairness
through the concept of a dynamic validation set, which evolves alongside the
test set, replacing the traditional static validation approach. We also propose
an iterative algorithm, SMITE, to select optimal in-context examples, with each
example set validated against its corresponding dynamic validation set. The
in-context set with the lowest total error is used as the final demonstration
set. Our experiments across four different LLMs show that our proposed
techniques significantly improve both predictive accuracy and fairness compared
to baseline methods. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply dynamic
validation in the context of in-context learning for LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，数据泄露风险增加，亟需提前检测和预防泄露的措施。

Method: 通过使用有版权材料的精心整理数据集，训练神经网络分类器，在文本生成前分析模型内部状态，以检测泄露风险。

Result: 该方法有效减缓了版权数据泄露风险，具备可扩展性，可无缝融入AI工作流程，确保符合法规和隐私保护。

Conclusion: 基于内部状态的检测方式是预防敏感信息泄露的有效策略，有助于提升AI系统的安全性与合规性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) but pose risks of inadvertently exposing copyrighted or proprietary data,
especially when such data is used for training but not intended for
distribution. Traditional methods address these leaks only after content is
generated, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive information. This study
introduces a proactive approach: examining LLMs' internal states before text
generation to detect potential leaks. By using a curated dataset of copyrighted
materials, we trained a neural network classifier to identify risks, allowing
for early intervention by stopping the generation process or altering outputs
to prevent disclosure. Integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
system, this framework ensures adherence to copyright and licensing
requirements while enhancing data privacy and ethical standards. Our results
show that analyzing internal states effectively mitigates the risk of
copyrighted data leakage, offering a scalable solution that fits smoothly into
AI workflows, ensuring compliance with copyright regulations while maintaining
high-quality text generation. The implementation is available on
GitHub.\footnote{https://github.com/changhu73/Internal_states_leakage}

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了GPT及其他大规模语言模型中的污染性中文Token，定义了PoC Token，并通过微调模型检测其存在，发现GPT词表中污染Token比例较高，且与训练数据相关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升对大规模语言模型中污染内容的认知，确保模型安全和内容质量。

Method: 定义PoC Token概念，微调模型检测PoC Token，分析Token ID分布，验证在已有数据集上的效果，推测模型训练数据中的污染比例。

Result: PoC Token广泛存在，GPT表现最差，长中文Token中超过23%是污染内容。在GPT-4o中，相关网页比例估算为0.5%。

Conclusion: PoC Token的存在影响模型安全，检测方法有效，为改善训练数据和模型内容管理提供依据。

Abstract: Tokens are basic elements in the datasets for LLM training. It is well-known
that many tokens representing Chinese phrases in the vocabulary of GPT
(4o/4o-mini/o1/o3/4.5/4.1/o4-mini) are indicating contents like pornography or
online gambling. Based on this observation, our goal is to locate Polluted
Chinese (PoC) tokens in LLMs and study the relationship between PoC tokens'
existence and training data. (1) We give a formal definition and taxonomy of
PoC tokens based on the GPT's vocabulary. (2) We build a PoC token detector via
fine-tuning an LLM to label PoC tokens in vocabularies by considering each
token's both semantics and related contents from the search engines. (3) We
study the speculation on the training data pollution via PoC tokens'
appearances (token ID). Experiments on GPT and other 23 LLMs indicate that
tokens widely exist while GPT's vocabulary behaves the worst: more than 23%
long Chinese tokens (i.e., a token with more than two Chinese characters) are
either porn or online gambling. We validate the accuracy of our speculation
method on famous pre-training datasets like C4 and Pile. Then, considering
GPT-4o, we speculate that the ratio of "Yui Hatano" related webpages in
GPT-4o's training data is around 0.5%.

*Changsong Liu,Yizhou Peng,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于合成多重发音的上下文偏置方法，有效提升0-shot上下文语音识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决有限训练数据和发音不一致带来的OOV词识别难题。

Method: 利用TTS合成多样样本，借助预训练Whisper模型提取多重发音变体，并构建前缀树进行偏置，改善解码。

Result: 在Librispeech数据集上实现了偏置词错误率明显下降（42%-43%），同时保持无偏估计。

Conclusion: 该方法通过合成驱动的多发音偏置，有效增强了零-shot上下文ASR中的OOV词识别能力，具有很强的应用前景。

Abstract: Contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems allow for recognizing
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, such as named entities or rare words. However,
it remains challenging due to limited training data and ambiguous or
inconsistent pronunciations. In this paper, we propose a synthesis-driven
multi-pronunciation contextual biasing method that performs zero-shot
contextual ASR on a pretrained Whisper model. Specifically, we leverage
text-to-speech (TTS) systems to synthesize diverse speech samples containing
each target rare word, and then use the pretrained Whisper model to extract
multiple predicted pronunciation variants. These variant token sequences are
compiled into a prefix-trie, which assigns rewards to beam hypotheses in a
shallow-fusion manner during beam-search decoding. After which, any recognized
variant is mapped back to the original rare word in the final transcription.
The evaluation results on the Librispeech dataset show that our method reduces
biased word error rate (WER) by 42% on test-clean and 43% on test-other while
maintaining unbiased WER essentially unchanged.

*Kaiwen Yan,Xuanqing Shi,Hongcheng Guo,Wenxuan Wang,Zhuosheng Zhang,Chengwei Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 引入动态推理额度分配（DRQA）以优化大规模推理模型的推理过程，有效减少无谓推理，提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLLMs在简单问题上产生过度推理的问题，提升推理效率和资源利用。

Method: 结合批处理中的偏好数据与强化学习，训练模型自适应分配推理资源。

Result: 显著降低了Token消耗，并在多数学科测验中保持甚至提升了答案准确率。

Conclusion: DRQA有效缓解过度思考问题，为大模型的高效部署提供了新方向。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O3 and DeepSeek-R1,
have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities by performing structured and
multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that RLLMs often suffer
from overthinking, i.e., producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains even
for simple questions, leading to excessive token consumption and computational
inefficiency. Interestingly, we observe that when processing multiple questions
in batch mode, RLLMs exhibit more resource-efficient behavior by dynamically
compressing reasoning steps for easier problems, due to implicit resource
competition. Inspired by this, we propose Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation
(DRQA), a novel method that transfers the benefits of resource competition from
batch processing to single-question inference. Specifically, DRQA leverages
batch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to train the model
to allocate reasoning resources adaptively. By encouraging the model to
internalize a preference for responses that are both accurate and concise, DRQA
enables it to generate concise answers for simple questions while retaining
sufficient reasoning depth for more challenging ones. Extensive experiments on
a wide range of mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that DRQA significantly reduces token usage while maintaining, and in many
cases improving, answer accuracy. By effectively mitigating the overthinking
problem, DRQA offers a promising direction for more efficient and scalable
deployment of RLLMs, and we hope it inspires further exploration into
fine-grained control of reasoning behaviors.

Abstract: Introducing MARK, the Multi-stAge Reasoning frameworK for cultural value
survey response simulation, designed to enhance the accuracy, steerability, and
interpretability of large language models in this task. The system is inspired
by the type dynamics theory in the MBTI psychological framework for personality
research. It effectively predicts and utilizes human demographic information

prediction, and self-weighted cognitive imitation. Experiments on the World
Values Survey show that MARK outperforms existing baselines by 10% accuracy and
reduces the divergence between model predictions and human preferences. This
highlights the potential of our framework to improve zero-shot personalization
and help social scientists interpret model predictions.

Result: 连续特征普遍优于离散标记，各种分析揭示了其各自的特性和学习模式。

Conclusion: 连续特征在SpeechLLMs中表现更佳，提供了促进语音理解的理论依据和实践指导。

Abstract: With the rise of Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs), two dominant
approaches have emerged for speech processing: discrete tokens and continuous
features. Each approach has demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-related
processing tasks. However, the performance gap between these two paradigms has
not been thoroughly explored. To address this gap, we present a fair comparison
of self-supervised learning (SSL)-based discrete and continuous features under
the same experimental settings. We evaluate their performance across six spoken
language understanding-related tasks using both small and large-scale LLMs
(Qwen1.5-0.5B and Llama3.1-8B). We further conduct in-depth analyses, including
efficient comparison, SSL layer analysis, LLM layer analysis, and robustness
comparison. Our findings reveal that continuous features generally outperform
discrete tokens in various tasks. Each speech processing method exhibits
distinct characteristics and patterns in how it learns and processes speech
information. We hope our results will provide valuable insights to advance
spoken language understanding in SpeechLLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种新的上下文压缩算法ILRe，有效处理超长输入，显著提升处理速度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在长文本场景中的效率和效果不足的问题，尤其是在处理长距离依赖时的计算复杂度和存储负担。

Method: 引入中间层检索ILRe，通过在指定中间层编码上下文，利用多池化核策略完善语义，再结合注意力得分进行Token召回，减少复杂度。

Result: ILRe显著降低预填充复杂度，从O(L²)降至O(L)，在长文本场景下性能优越，处理一百万Token请求速度快，达到79.8的RULER-1M评分。

Conclusion: ILRe为长文本处理提供了高效、低成本的解决方案，无需额外训练即实现大幅提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated success across many
benchmarks. However, they still exhibit limitations in long-context scenarios,
primarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational
complexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs. To
mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline,
called Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate
decoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to
that layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query
and full key cache in that specified layer. In particular, we propose a
multi-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to
maintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the
prefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$, but also achieves performance
comparable to or better than the full context in the long context scenarios.
Without additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a
single $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\approx
180\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\approx 79.8$ with model
Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有USKR方法依赖任务特定策略和定制表示的问题，提升跨任务推理性能。

Method: 提出基于Python Pandas的代码统一表示，结合知识转移和反馈修正机制，以增强LLMs的跨任务推理能力。

Result: 在六个关键基准测试中，Pandora超越现有统一推理方法，并与特定任务方法抗衡，表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过创新的代码表示和知识转移，Pandora显著提升了结构化知识推理的泛化能力，为未来USKR研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language
questions by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and knowledge
graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods rely on task-specific strategies
or bespoke representations, which hinder their ability to dismantle barriers
between different SKR tasks, thereby constraining their overall performance in
cross-task scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{Pandora}, a novel
USKR framework that addresses the limitations of existing methods by leveraging
two key innovations. First, we propose a code-based unified knowledge
representation using \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API, which aligns
seamlessly with the pre-training of LLMs. This representation facilitates a
cohesive approach to handling different structured knowledge sources. Building
on this foundation, we employ knowledge transfer to bolster the unified
reasoning process of LLMs by automatically building cross-task memory. By
adaptively correcting reasoning using feedback from code execution,
\textsc{Pandora} showcases impressive unified reasoning capabilities. Extensive
experiments on six widely used benchmarks across three SKR tasks demonstrate
that \textsc{Pandora} outperforms existing unified reasoning frameworks and
competes effectively with task-specific methods.

Method: 分析不同语言信息需求及多语言技术限制。

Result: 强调多语言信息普及的必要性和技术挑战。

Conclusion: 解决多语言障碍有助于实现互联网的全面包容与普及。

Abstract: The usage of Internet has grown exponentially over the last two decades. The
number of Internet users has grown from 16 Million to 1650 Million from 1995 to
2010. It has become a major repository of information catering almost every
area. Since the Internet has its origin in USA which is English speaking
country there is huge dominance of English on the World Wide Web. Although
English is a globally acceptable language, still there is a huge population in
the world which is not able to access the Internet due to language constraints.
It has been estimated that only 20-25% of the world population speaks English
as a native language. More and more people are accessing the Internet nowadays
removing the cultural and linguistic barriers and hence there is a high growth
in the number of non-English speaking users over the last few years on the
Internet. Although many solutions have been provided to remove the linguistic
barriers, still there is a huge gap to be filled. This paper attempts to
analyze the need of information availability in different languages and the
various technological constraints related to multi-linguism on the Internet.

Conclusion: 提出的无监督模型有效结合语言内在特征，实现借词检测的突破，为语言学研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for detecting loanwords i.e., words
borrowed from one language into another. While prior work has primarily relied
on language-external information to identify loanwords, such approaches can
introduce circularity and constraints into the historical linguistics workflow.
In contrast, our model relies solely on language-internal information to
process both native and borrowed words in monolingual and multilingual
wordlists. By extracting pertinent linguistic features, scoring them, and
mapping them probabilistically, we iteratively refine initial results by
identifying and generalizing from emerging patterns until convergence. This
hybrid approach leverages both linguistic and statistical cues to guide the
discovery process. We evaluate our method on the task of isolating loanwords in
datasets from six standard Indo-European languages: English, German, French,
Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms baseline methods, with strong performance gains observed when
scaling to cross-linguistic data.

Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of argumentation that aims to automatically
extract argumentative structures and their relations from natural language
texts. This paper investigates how a single large language model can be
leveraged to perform one or several argument mining tasks. Our contributions
are two-fold. First, we construct a multi-task dataset by surveying and
converting 19 well-known argument mining datasets from the literature into a
unified format. Second, we explore various training strategies using Meta AI's
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model: (1) fine-tuning on individual tasks, (2)
fine-tuning jointly on multiple tasks, and (3) merging models fine-tuned
separately on individual tasks. Our experiments show that task-specific
fine-tuning significantly improves individual performance across all tasks.
Moreover, multi-task fine-tuning maintains strong performance without
degradation, suggesting effective transfer learning across related tasks.
Finally, we demonstrate that model merging offers a viable compromise: it
yields competitive performance while mitigating the computational costs
associated with full multi-task fine-tuning.

Abstract: Debiasing techniques such as SentDebias aim to reduce bias in large language
models (LLMs). Previous studies have evaluated their cross-lingual
transferability by directly applying these methods to LLM representations,
revealing their limited effectiveness across languages. In this work, we
therefore propose to perform debiasing in a joint latent space rather than
directly on LLM representations. We construct a well-aligned cross-lingual
latent space using an autoencoder trained on parallel TED talk scripts. Our
experiments with Aya-expanse and two debiasing techniques across four languages
(English, French, German, Dutch) demonstrate that a) autoencoders effectively
construct a well-aligned cross-lingual latent space, and b) applying debiasing
techniques in the learned cross-lingual latent space significantly improves
both the overall debiasing performance and cross-lingual transferability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) take sequences of subwords as input, requiring
them to effective compose subword representations into meaningful word-level
representations. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of experiments
to probe how LLMs compose subword information, focusing on three key aspects:
structural similarity, semantic decomposability, and form retention. Our
analysis of the experiments suggests that these five LLM families can be
classified into three distinct groups, likely reflecting difference in their
underlying composition strategies. Specifically, we observe (i) three distinct
patterns in the evolution of structural similarity between subword compositions
and whole-word representations across layers; (ii) great performance when
probing layer by layer their sensitivity to semantic decompositionality; and
(iii) three distinct patterns when probing sensitivity to formal features,
e.g., character sequence length. These findings provide valuable insights into
the compositional dynamics of LLMs and highlight different compositional
pattens in how LLMs encode and integrate subword information.

language models as judges (LLJs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
traditional metrics, but their validity remains underexplored. This position
paper argues that the current enthusiasm around LLJs may be premature, as their
adoption has outpaced rigorous scrutiny of their reliability and validity as
evaluators. Drawing on measurement theory from the social sciences, we identify
and critically assess four core assumptions underlying the use of LLJs: their
ability to act as proxies for human judgment, their capabilities as evaluators,
their scalability, and their cost-effectiveness. We examine how each of these
assumptions may be challenged by the inherent limitations of LLMs, LLJs, or
current practices in NLG evaluation. To ground our analysis, we explore three
applications of LLJs: text summarization, data annotation, and safety
alignment. Finally, we highlight the need for more responsible evaluation
practices in LLJs evaluation, to ensure that their growing role in the field
supports, rather than undermines, progress in NLG.

Motivation: 探究量化对模型偏差的具体影响，兼顾效率与公平性。

Method: 评估不同量化策略在多个偏差类型和基准上的表现，涵盖多种模型架构和推理能力。

Result: 量化能减轻部分有害偏差，但在某些任务中会略微增加偏差，影响范围跨越多类别和模型类型。

Conclusion: 在实际应用中，应谨慎平衡模型压缩效率与伦理责任。

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of how quantization affects
model bias, with particular attention to its impact on individual demographic
subgroups. We focus on weight and activation quantization strategies and
examine their effects across a broad range of bias types, including
stereotypes, toxicity, sentiment, and fairness. We employ both probabilistic
and generated text-based metrics across nine benchmarks and evaluate models
varying in architecture family and reasoning ability. Our findings show that
quantization has a nuanced impact on bias: while it can reduce model toxicity
and does not significantly impact sentiment, it tends to slightly increase
stereotypes and unfairness in generative tasks, especially under aggressive
compression. These trends are generally consistent across demographic
categories and model types, although their magnitude depends on the specific
setting. Overall, our results highlight the importance of carefully balancing
efficiency and ethical considerations when applying quantization in practice.

Conclusion: 强调情感变化作为抑郁指示的重要性，为在复杂疾病背景下的语音抑郁检测提供初步证据。

Abstract: Depression commonly co-occurs with neurodegenerative disorders like Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), yet the potential of speech-based Artificial Intelligence for
detecting depression in such contexts remains unexplored. This study examines
the transferability of speech-based depression detection methods to people with
MS (pwMS) through cross-corpus and cross-lingual analysis using English data
from the general population and German data from pwMS. Our approach implements
supervised machine learning models using: 1) conventional speech and language
features commonly used in the field, 2) emotional dimensions derived from a
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model, and 3) exploratory speech feature
analysis. Despite limited data, our models detect depressive mood in pwMS with
moderate generalisability, achieving a 66% Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) on a
binary task. Feature selection further improved performance, boosting UAR to
74%. Our findings also highlight the relevant role emotional changes have as an
indicator of depressive mood in both the general population and within PwMS.
This study provides an initial exploration into generalising speech-based
depression detection, even in the presence of co-occurring conditions, such as
neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: We present a case study evaluating large language models (LLMs) with
128K-token context windows on a technical question answering (QA) task. Our
benchmark is built on a user manual for an agricultural machine, available in
English, French, and German. It simulates a cross-lingual information retrieval
scenario where questions are posed in English against all three language
versions of the manual. The evaluation focuses on realistic
"needle-in-a-haystack" challenges and includes unanswerable questions to test
for hallucinations. We compare nine long-context LLMs using direct prompting
against three Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies (keyword,
semantic, hybrid), with an LLM-as-a-judge for evaluation. Our findings for this
specific manual show that Hybrid RAG consistently outperforms direct
long-context prompting. Models like Gemini 2.5 Flash and the smaller Qwen 2.5
7B achieve high accuracy (over 85%) across all languages with RAG. This paper
contributes a detailed analysis of LLM performance in a specialized industrial
domain and an open framework for similar evaluations, highlighting practical
trade-offs and challenges.

Conclusion: 该研究为大模型中计划行为的机械性研究提供了可复现、可扩展的基础工具和方法。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across a wide range of multi-step reasoning tasks. Recent work suggests that
LLMs may perform planning - selecting a future target token in advance and
generating intermediate tokens that lead towards it - rather than merely
improvising one token at a time. However, existing studies assume fixed
planning horizons and often focus on single prompts or narrow domains. To
distinguish planning from improvisation across models and tasks, we present
formal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning and operationalize
them as a semi-automated annotation pipeline. We apply this pipeline to both
base and instruction-tuned Gemma-2-2B models on the MBPP code generation
benchmark and a poem generation task where Claude 3.5 Haiku was previously
shown to plan. Our findings show that planning is not universal: unlike Haiku,
Gemma-2-2B solves the same poem generation task through improvisation, and on
MBPP it switches between planning and improvisation across similar tasks and
even successive token predictions. We further show that instruction tuning
refines existing planning behaviors in the base model rather than creating them
from scratch. Together, these studies provide a reproducible and scalable
foundation for mechanistic studies of planning in LLMs.

superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, validating the

Conclusion: 基于选择机制的句子表示增强策略有效提升模型表现，具有广泛的应用潜力和推广价值。

Abstract: The combination of Transformer-based encoders with contrastive learning
represents the current mainstream paradigm for sentence representation
learning. This paradigm is typically based on the hidden states of the last
Transformer block of the encoder. However, within Transformer-based encoders,
different blocks exhibit varying degrees of semantic perception ability. From
the perspective of interpretability, the semantic perception potential of
knowledge neurons is modulated by stimuli, thus rational cross-block
representation fusion is a direction worth optimizing. To balance the semantic
redundancy and loss across block fusion, we propose a sentence representation
selection mechanism S\textsuperscript{2}Sent, which integrates a parameterized
nested selector downstream of the Transformer-based encoder. This selector
performs spatial selection (SS) and nested frequency selection (FS) from a
modular perspective. The SS innovatively employs a spatial squeeze based
self-gating mechanism to obtain adaptive weights, which not only achieves
fusion with low information redundancy but also captures the dependencies
between embedding features. The nested FS replaces GAP with different DCT basis
functions to achieve spatial squeeze with low semantic loss. Extensive
experiments have demonstrated that S\textsuperscript{2}Sent achieves
significant improvements over baseline methods with negligible additional
parameters and inference latency, while highlighting high integrability and
scalability.

Result: 模型能有效预测发声时机，实现更具情境感知的主动对话，提升协作潜力。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和方法提升了LLMs在动态交互中的主动参与能力，为对话AI的发展提供新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
understanding and generating human-like text, yet they largely operate as
reactive agents, responding only when directly prompted. This passivity creates
an "awareness gap," limiting their potential as truly collaborative partners in
dynamic human discussions. We introduce $\textit{DiscussLLM}$, a framework
designed to bridge this gap by training models to proactively decide not just
$\textit{what}$ to say, but critically, $\textit{when}$ to speak. Our primary
contribution is a scalable two-stage data generation pipeline that synthesizes
a large-scale dataset of realistic multi-turn human discussions. Each
discussion is annotated with one of five intervention types (e.g., Factual
Correction, Concept Definition) and contains an explicit conversational trigger
where an AI intervention adds value. By training models to predict a special
silent token when no intervention is needed, they learn to remain quiet until a
helpful contribution can be made. We explore two architectural baselines: an
integrated end-to-end model and a decoupled classifier-generator system
optimized for low-latency inference. We evaluate these models on their ability
to accurately time interventions and generate helpful responses, paving the way
for more situationally aware and proactive conversational AI.

Conclusion: JSA-RAG通过有效优化算法改善了检索增强生成模型的训练表现，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely recognized paradigm
to combine parametric memory with non-parametric memories. An RAG model
consists of two serial connecting components (retriever and generator). A major
challenge in end-to-end optimization of the RAG model is that marginalization
over relevant passages (modeled as discrete latent variables) from a knowledge
base is required. Traditional top-K marginalization and variational RAG (VRAG)
suffer from biased or high-variance gradient estimates. In this paper, we
propose and develop joint stochastic approximation (JSA) based end-to-end
training of RAG, which is referred to as JSA-RAG. The JSA algorithm is a
stochastic extension of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm and is
particularly powerful in estimating discrete latent variable models. Extensive
experiments are conducted on five datasets for two tasks (open-domain question
answering, knowledge-grounded dialogs) and show that JSA-RAG significantly
outperforms both vanilla RAG and VRAG. Further analysis shows the efficacy of
JSA-RAG from the perspectives of generation, retrieval, and low-variance
gradient estimate.

Result: 在SignBank+和意大利LaCAM数据集上实现优于现有模型的性能，尤其在低数据环境中表现突出。

Conclusion: AulSign展示了大语言模型在手语翻译中的潜力，有助于推动手语信息的普及和无障碍交流。

Abstract: Translating natural languages into sign languages is a highly complex and
underexplored task. Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity,
the development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited
availability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign
language data. Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these
data-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically
domain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic
richness of sign languages. To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use
of LLMs for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages
Large Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample
selection and subsequent sign association. Despite their impressive abilities
in processing text, LLMs lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore,
they are unable to natively perform this kind of translation. To overcome this
limitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural
language and instruct the model to use them. We evaluate our method on both
English and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the
field, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset. We demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenario. Our
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AulSign, with the potential to
enhance accessibility and inclusivity in communication technologies for
underrepresented linguistic communities.

Abstract: Music serves as a powerful reflection of individual identity, often aligning
with deeper psychological traits. Prior research has established correlations
between musical preferences and personality traits, while separate studies have
demonstrated that personality is detectable through linguistic analysis. Our
study bridges these two research domains by investigating whether individuals'
musical preferences are recognizable in their spontaneous language through the
lens of the Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness,
Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism). Using a carefully curated
dataset of over 500,000 text samples from nearly 5,000 authors with reliably
identified musical preferences, we build advanced models to assess personality
characteristics. Our results reveal significant personality differences across
fans of five musical genres. We release resources for future research at the
intersection of computational linguistics, music psychology and personality
analysis.

Conclusion: 该研究展现了当前合成转录的局限性，诊断工具有助于未来改进。

Abstract: Synthetic transcript generation is critical in contact center domains, where
privacy and data scarcity limit model training and evaluation. Unlike prior
synthetic dialogue generation work on open-domain or medical dialogues, contact
center conversations are goal-oriented, role-asymmetric, and behaviorally
complex, featuring disfluencies, ASR noise, and compliance-driven agent
actions. In deployments where transcripts are unavailable, standard pipelines
still yield derived call attributes such as Intent Summaries, Topic Flow, and
QA Evaluation Forms. We leverage these as supervision signals to guide
generation. To assess the quality of such outputs, we introduce a diagnostic
framework of 18 linguistically and behaviorally grounded metrics for comparing
real and synthetic transcripts. We benchmark four language-agnostic generation
strategies, from simple prompting to characteristic-aware multi-stage
approaches, alongside reference-free baselines. Results reveal persistent
challenges: no method excels across all traits, with notable deficits in
disfluency, sentiment, and behavioral realism. Our diagnostic tool exposes
these gaps, enabling fine-grained evaluation and stress testing of synthetic
dialogue across languages.

Conclusion: 基于自然语言推断的奖励模型为强化学习提供更强的理解能力和更稳健的奖励信号，推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: The emergence of LM-based judging reward modeling, represented by generative
reward models, has successfully made reinforcement learning from AI feedback
(RLAIF) efficient and scalable. To further advance this paradigm, we propose a
core insight: this form of reward modeling shares fundamental formal
consistency with natural language inference (NLI), a core task in natural
language understanding. This reframed perspective points to a key path for
building superior reward models: scaling the model's comprehension boundaries.
Pursuing this path, exploratory experiments on NLI tasks demonstrate that the
slot prediction masked language models (MLMs) incorporating contextual
explanations achieve significantly better performance compared to mainstream
autoregressive models. Based on this key finding, we propose ESFP-RM, a
two-stage LM-based judging reward model that utilizes an explanation based slot
framework for prediction to fully leverage the advantages of MLMs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that in both reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF) and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, the ESFP-RM framework delivers
more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to generative reward
models.

Method: 定义涵盖三维的多场景、多任务评估体系，结合双重评估方法（Arena与Rubrics），采用模型和人类输出进行比较。

Result: 模型在语义信息方面表现亮眼，但在语用信息和环境声音感知上仍有不足。模型通过增加回应长度维持连贯性，设计优化优于粗放式扩展。评估体系显示评判一致性，但存在偏差及对明确规则的依赖。

Conclusion: 需要更加稳健且考虑语音特性的评估框架，以全面衡量多轮S2S模型性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech-to-speech (S2S) large language models (LLMs)
has significantly improved real-time spoken interaction. However, current
evaluation frameworks remain inadequate for assessing performance in complex,
multi-turn dialogues. To address this, we introduce MTalk-Bench, a multi-turn
S2S benchmark covering three core dimensions: Semantic Information,
Paralinguistic Information, and Ambient Sound. Each dimension includes nine
realistic scenarios, along with targeted tasks to assess specific capabilities
such as reasoning. Our dual-method evaluation framework combines Arena-style
evaluation (pairwise comparison) and Rubrics-based evaluation (absolute
scoring) for relative and absolute assessment. The benchmark includes both
model and human outputs, evaluated by human evaluators and LLMs. Experimental
results reveal two sets of findings. Overall performance of S2S LLMs: (1)
models excel at semantic information processing yet underperform on
paralinguistic information and ambient sounds perception; (2) models typically
regain coherence by increasing response length, sacrificing efficiency in
multi-turn dialogues; (3) modality-aware, task-specific designs outperform
brute scaling. Evaluation framework and reliability: (1) Arena and Rubrics
yield consistent, complementary rankings, but reliable distinctions emerge only
when performance gaps are large; (2) LLM-as-a-judge aligns with humans when
gaps are clear or criteria explicit, but exhibits position and length biases
and is reliable on nonverbal evaluation only with text annotations. These
results highlight current limitations in S2S evaluation and the need for more
robust, speech-aware assessment frameworks.

Motivation: 解决自动检测性别歧视的偏见与局限，提升模型对多样观点的适应性。

Method: 分析多种LLMs在EXIST 2024推文数据集上的表现，并评估其偏见和感知多样性。

Result: LLMs能在整体上检测歧视，但不足以反映不同人口群的多样性偏见，需改进模型校准。

Conclusion: 需要更好校准的模型，以考虑不同群体的多样化视角，从而改进性别歧视检测的准确性与公平性。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven to be a tool that could
help in the automatic detection of sexism. Previous studies have shown that
these models contain biases that do not accurately reflect reality, especially
for minority groups. Despite various efforts to improve the detection of sexist
content, this task remains a significant challenge due to its subjective nature
and the biases present in automated models. We explore the capabilities of
different LLMs to detect sexism in social media text using the EXIST 2024 tweet
dataset. It includes annotations from six distinct profiles for each tweet,
allowing us to evaluate to what extent LLMs can mimic these groups' perceptions
in sexism detection. Additionally, we analyze the demographic biases present in
the models and conduct a statistical analysis to identify which demographic
characteristics (age, gender) contribute most effectively to this task. Our
results show that, while LLMs can to some extent detect sexism when considering
the overall opinion of populations, they do not accurately replicate the
diversity of perceptions among different demographic groups. This highlights
the need for better-calibrated models that account for the diversity of
perspectives across different populations.

whether the most popular Large Language Models (LLMs) possess proper knowledge
the Chinese classifiers is an issue that has largely remain unexplored in the
Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature.
  To address such a question, we employ various masking strategies to evaluate
the LLMs' intrinsic ability, the contribution of different sentence elements,
and the working of the attention mechanisms during prediction. Besides, we
explore fine-tuning for LLMs to enhance the classifier performance.
  Our findings reveal that LLMs perform worse than BERT, even with fine-tuning.
The prediction, as expected, greatly benefits from the information about the
following noun, which also explains the advantage of models with a
bidirectional attention mechanism such as BERT.

TL;DR: MIRAGE通过结构化医学知识图谱实现多链推理，有效降低错误积累，提升医疗问答的准确性和可追溯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单一推理链在医疗问答中的误差累积问题，提高推理的准确性和可追溯性。

Method: 将复杂问题分解为实体相关子问句，执行平行推理链，通过邻居扩展和多跳遍历动态检索证据，并进行跨链验证整合答案。

Result: 在多个医疗问答基准上优于现有模型，无论自动还是人工评估都表现出更高的性能，且增强了推理链的可解释性。

Conclusion: MIRAGE通过结构化推理框架，有效提升医疗问答的性能和透明度，适用于需要高准确性和可追溯的复杂场景。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown significant progress in test-time
scaling through chain-of-thought prompting. Current approaches like search-o1
integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning
processes but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating
unstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a
result, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the
reasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical
question-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical
requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain
Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time
scalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over
structured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex
queries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference
chains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop
traversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve
contradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k,
CMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o,
Tree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both
automatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability
by generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to
concrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex
medical reasoning scenarios. The code will be available for further research.

### [113] [Revisiting Rule-Based Stuttering Detection: A Comprehensive Analysis of Interpretable Models for Clinical Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16681)
*Eric Zhang*

TL;DR: 规则基础的口吃检测系统在临床应用中具有重要价值，结合多层次特征分析与层级决策结构，提供高可解释性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在深度学习快速发展的背景下，探索规则基础方法的临床应用潜力，强调模型的可解释性与透明度。

Method: 提出结合语速归一化、多层声学特征和层次决策的增强规则框架，并在多个语料库上验证。

Result: 达成高精度，特别在延长部分检测中表现优异（97-99%），模型在不同说话速率下保持稳定，同时可与现代机器学习模型结合，用于临床决策支持。

Conclusion: 规则基础方法在临床环境中依然具备独特优势，尤其在决策审计、个性化调节和实时反馈方面，展现出与深度学习互补的价值。

Abstract: Stuttering affects approximately 1% of the global population, impacting
communication and quality of life. While recent advances in deep learning have
pushed the boundaries of automatic speech dysfluency detection, rule-based
approaches remain crucial for clinical applications where interpretability and
transparency are paramount. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of
rule-based stuttering detection systems, synthesizing insights from multiple
corpora including UCLASS, FluencyBank, and SEP-28k. We propose an enhanced
rule-based framework that incorporates speaking-rate normalization, multi-level
acoustic feature analysis, and hierarchical decision structures. Our approach
achieves competitive performance while maintaining complete
interpretability-critical for clinical adoption. We demonstrate that rule-based
systems excel particularly in prolongation detection (97-99% accuracy) and
provide stable performance across varying speaking rates. Furthermore, we show
how these interpretable models can be integrated with modern machine learning
pipelines as proposal generators or constraint modules, bridging the gap
between traditional speech pathology practices and contemporary AI systems. Our
analysis reveals that while neural approaches may achieve marginally higher
accuracy in unconstrained settings, rule-based methods offer unique advantages
in clinical contexts where decision auditability, patient-specific tuning, and
real-time feedback are essential.

Motivation: 理解影响数学成绩的因素，优化教育政策和干预措施。

Method: 采用MLR、RF、CATBoost和ANN模型，结合特征重要性和SHAP值进行模型解释，通过交叉验证评估性能。

Result: 非线性模型优于线性模型，关键影响因素包括社会经济状态、学习时间、教师动机和学生态度，模型表现稳定且解释性强，并揭示了国际间的差异。

Conclusion: 强调非线性模型在教育数据分析中的优势，展示XAI在理解和改进学生成绩中的应用潜力，促使个性化和公平教育策略的制定。

Abstract: Understanding the factors that shape students' mathematics performance is
vital for designing effective educational policies. This study applies
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to PISA 2018 data to
predict math achievement and identify key predictors across ten countries
(67,329 students). We tested four models: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR),
Random Forest (RF), CATBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), using
student, family, and school variables. Models were trained on 70% of the data
(with 5-fold cross-validation) and tested on 30%, stratified by country.
Performance was assessed with R^2 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). To ensure
interpretability, we used feature importance, SHAP values, and decision tree
visualizations. Non-linear models, especially RF and ANN, outperformed MLR,
with RF balancing accuracy and generalizability. Key predictors included
socio-economic status, study time, teacher motivation, and students' attitudes
toward mathematics, though their impact varied across countries. Visual
diagnostics such as scatterplots of predicted vs actual scores showed RF and
CATBoost aligned closely with actual performance. Findings highlight the
non-linear and context-dependent nature of achievement and the value of XAI in
educational research. This study uncovers cross-national patterns, informs
equity-focused reforms, and supports the development of personalized learning
strategies.

Conclusion: 通过系统评价和新方法，显著提升了临床编码模型的解释性，为临床应用提供更可靠的支持。

Abstract: Automated clinical coding involves mapping unstructured text from Electronic
Health Records (EHRs) to standardized code systems such as the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD). While recent advances in deep learning have
significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of ICD coding, the lack of
explainability in these models remains a major limitation, undermining trust
and transparency. Current explorations about explainability largely rely on
attention-based techniques and qualitative assessments by physicians, yet lack
systematic evaluation using consistent criteria on high-quality rationale
datasets, as well as dedicated approaches explicitly trained to generate
rationales for further enhancing explanation. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the explainability of the rationales for ICD coding
through two key lenses: faithfulness that evaluates how well explanations
reflect the model's actual reasoning and plausibility that measures how
consistent the explanations are with human expert judgment. To facilitate the
evaluation of plausibility, we construct a new rationale-annotated dataset,
offering denser annotations with diverse granularity and aligns better with
current clinical practice, and conduct evaluation across three types of
rationales of ICD coding. Encouraged by the promising plausibility of
LLM-generated rationales for ICD coding, we further propose new rationale
learning methods to improve the quality of model-generated rationales, where
rationales produced by prompting LLMs with/without annotation examples are used
as distant supervision signals. We empirically find that LLM-generated
rationales align most closely with those of human experts. Moreover,
incorporating few-shot human-annotated examples not only further improves
rationale generation but also enhances rationale-learning approaches.

Conclusion: PuzzleJAX为评测智能模型提供了强大、灵活且具有真实代表性的测试平台。

Abstract: We introduce PuzzleJAX, a GPU-accelerated puzzle game engine and description
language designed to support rapid benchmarking of tree search, reinforcement
learning, and LLM reasoning abilities. Unlike existing GPU-accelerated learning
environments that provide hard-coded implementations of fixed sets of games,
PuzzleJAX allows dynamic compilation of any game expressible in its
domain-specific language (DSL). This DSL follows PuzzleScript, which is a
popular and accessible online game engine for designing puzzle games. In this
paper, we validate in PuzzleJAX several hundred of the thousands of games
designed in PuzzleScript by both professional designers and casual creators
since its release in 2013, thereby demonstrating PuzzleJAX's coverage of an
expansive, expressive, and human-relevant space of tasks. By analyzing the
performance of search, learning, and language models on these games, we show
that PuzzleJAX can naturally express tasks that are both simple and intuitive
to understand, yet often deeply challenging to master, requiring a combination
of control, planning, and high-level insight.

TL;DR: 提出一种以单一视觉语言模型（VLM）为核心的医疗工作流程框架，实现模型路由与多任务处理，简化流程并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗工作流程碎片化，数据驱动模型识别和输出标准化不足，影响效率和成本。

Method: 利用单一VLM作为模型匹配器和多任务执行者，通过分阶段提示和答复选择优化流程。

Result: 在胃肠学、血液学、眼科学和病理学四个领域，单模型部署效果媲美或接近专业模型。

Conclusion: 该框架可减少开发与集成成本，提高透明度，助力医疗AI的高效落地。

Abstract: Clinical workflows are fragmented as a patchwork of scripts and task-specific
networks that often handle triage, task selection, and model deployment. These
pipelines are rarely streamlined for data science pipeline, reducing efficiency
and raising operational costs. Workflows also lack data-driven model
identification (from imaging/tabular inputs) and standardized delivery of model
outputs. In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework that
uses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First
(Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an
incoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow
(modality -> primary abnormality -> model-card id). Checks are provided by (i)
stagewise prompts that allow early exit via None/Normal/Other and (ii) a
stagewise answer selector that arbitrates between the top-2 candidates at each
stage, reducing the chance of an incorrect selection and aligning the workflow
with clinical risk tolerance. Second (Solution 2), we fine-tune the VLM on
specialty-specific datasets ensuring a single model covers multiple downstream
tasks within each specialty, maintaining performance while simplifying
deployment. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology,
our single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines.
  Compared with pipelines composed of many task-specific agents, this approach
shows that one VLM can both decide and do. It may reduce effort by data
scientists, shorten monitoring, increase the transparency of model selection
(with per-stage justifications), and lower integration overhead.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文利用贝叶斯框架定义并量化大语言模型中的阿谀奉承行为（sycophancy），揭示模型在面对用户观点时的偏离理性行为的特征，发现模型表现出一定的非理性偏差，且这些偏差对推理错误的影响不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型中的阿谀奉承行为对理性推理的影响，弥补现有指标无法全面衡量理性偏差的不足。

Method: 采用贝叶斯方法，通过比较模型在不同任务中的后验分布偏差，分析其行为偏离理性的程度，与不同 probing 方法结合，评估sycophancy的影响。

Result: 模型存在不理性的表现，probing会增加偏向特定结果的偏差，有时提高或降低贝叶斯误差，偏差变化与错误的关系不强。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯分析揭示了大模型的非理性行为特征，提示在人机合作中需注意sycophancy带来的潜在认知偏差，且仅关注ground truth不够全面，应结合理性偏差的多角度分析。

Abstract: Sycophancy, or overly agreeable or flattering behavior, is a documented issue
in large language models (LLMs), and is critical to understand in the context
of human/AI collaboration. Prior works typically quantify sycophancy by
measuring shifts in behavior or impacts on accuracy, but neither metric
characterizes shifts in rationality, and accuracy measures can only be used in
scenarios with a known ground truth. In this work, we utilize a Bayesian
framework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when
presented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and
irrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives. In
comparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive
behavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not
have a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination
of open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing
sycophancy. We also experiment with multiple methods for eliciting probability
judgments from LLMs. We hypothesize that probing LLMs for sycophancy will cause
deviations in LLMs' predicted posteriors that will lead to increased Bayesian
error. Our findings indicate that: 1) LLMs are not Bayesian rational, 2)
probing for sycophancy results in significant increases to the predicted
posterior in favor of the steered outcome, 3) sycophancy sometimes results in
increased Bayesian error, and in a small number of cases actually decreases
error, and 4) changes in Bayesian error due to sycophancy are not strongly
correlated in Brier score, suggesting that studying the impact of sycophancy on
ground truth alone does not fully capture errors in reasoning due to
sycophancy.

Conclusion: 通过引入推理引导的归因机制，推动了理解和可信的图表分析系统发展，为实际应用提供更可靠的支持。

Abstract: Data visualizations like charts are fundamental tools for quantitative
analysis and decision-making across fields, requiring accurate interpretation
and mathematical reasoning. The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) offers promising capabilities for automated visual data analysis, such
as processing charts, answering questions, and generating summaries. However,
they provide no visibility into which parts of the visual data informed their
conclusions; this black-box nature poses significant challenges to real-world
trust and adoption. In this paper, we take the first major step towards
evaluating and enhancing the capabilities of MLLMs to attribute their reasoning
process by highlighting the specific regions in charts and graphs that justify
model answers. To this end, we contribute RADAR, a semi-automatic approach to
obtain a benchmark dataset comprising 17,819 diverse samples with charts,
questions, reasoning steps, and attribution annotations. We also introduce a
method that provides attribution for chart-based mathematical reasoning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our reasoning-guided approach improves
attribution accuracy by 15% compared to baseline methods, and enhanced
attribution capabilities translate to stronger answer generation, achieving an
average BERTScore of $\sim$ 0.90, indicating high alignment with ground truth
responses. This advancement represents a significant step toward more
interpretable and trustworthy chart analysis systems, enabling users to verify
and understand model decisions through reasoning and attribution.

Motivation: 研究无限辩论框架的计算复杂性，特别是有限无限AF的特性及其在推理中的应用潜力。

Method: 分析无限但有限的AF的计算复杂性，特别关注从可接受性语义到计算复杂性之间的关系。

Result: 发现有限性不一定降低复杂度，但在可接受性语义下存在某些组合约束显著减低复杂性。

Conclusion: 有限无限AF在表达能力和计算可行性之间提供了良好的平衡，适用于多种推理情境。

Abstract: Abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs) provide a formal setting to analyze
many forms of reasoning with conflicting information. While the expressiveness
of general infinite AFs make them a tempting tool for modeling many kinds of
reasoning scenarios, the computational intractability of solving infinite AFs
limit their use, even in many theoretical applications.
  We investigate the complexity of computational problems related to infinite
but finitary argumentations frameworks, that is, infinite AFs where each
argument is attacked by only finitely many others. Our results reveal a
surprising scenario. On one hand, we see that the assumption of being finitary
does not automatically guarantee a drop in complexity. However, for the
admissibility-based semantics, we find a remarkable combinatorial constraint
which entails a dramatic decrease in complexity.
  We conclude that for many forms of reasoning, the finitary infinite AFs
provide a natural setting for reasoning which balances well the competing goals
of being expressive enough to be applied to many reasoning settings while being
computationally tractable enough for the analysis within the framework to be
useful.

Result: GaS框架在解的质量和迁移性方面优于现有方法，效果显著。

Conclusion: 新框架通过联合训练实现两者优势，提升多旅行商问题的解决能力。

Abstract: This study addresses the Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem
($m^3$-TSP), which aims to coordinate tours for multiple salesmen such that the
length of the longest tour is minimized. Due to its NP-hard nature, exact
solvers become impractical under the assumption that $P \ne NP$. As a result,
learning-based approaches have gained traction for their ability to rapidly
generate high-quality approximate solutions. Among these, two-stage methods
combine learning-based components with classical solvers, simplifying the
learning objective. However, this decoupling often disrupts consistent
optimization, potentially degrading solution quality. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage framework named \textbf{Generate-and-Split} (GaS),
which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with an optimal splitting
algorithm in a joint training process. The splitting algorithm offers
near-linear scalability with respect to the number of cities and guarantees
optimal splitting in Euclidean space for any given path. To facilitate the
joint optimization of the RL component with the algorithm, we adopt an
LSTM-enhanced model architecture to address partial observability. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed GaS framework significantly outperforms
existing learning-based approaches in both solution quality and
transferability.

Conclusion: 该系统显著提升配电网分析的自动化水平和普及性，特别适合资源有限的中小型电力企业。

Abstract: Due to the rapid pace of electrification and decarbonization, distribution
grid (DG) operation and planning are becoming more complex, necessitating
advanced computational analyses to ensure grid reliability and resilience.
State-of-the-art DG analyses rely on disparate workflows of complex models,
functions, and data pipelines, which require expert knowledge and are
challenging to automate. Many small-scale utilities and cooperatives lack a
large R&D workforce and therefore cannot use advanced analysis at scale. To
address this gap, we develop a novel agentic AI system, PowerChain, to solve
unseen DG analysis tasks via automated agentic orchestration and large language
models (LLMs) function-calling. Given a natural language query, PowerChain
dynamically generates and executes an ordered sequence of domain-aware
functions guided by the semantics of an expert-built power systems function
pool and a select reference set of known, expert-generated workflow-query
pairs. Our results show that PowerChain can produce expert-level workflows with
both GPT-5 and open-source Qwen models on complex, unseen DG analysis tasks
operating on real utility data.

Abstract: The concepts of ``human-centered AI'' and ``value-based decision'' have
gained significant attention in both research and industry. However, many
critical aspects remain underexplored and require further investigation. In
particular, there is a need to understand how systems incorporate human values,
how humans can identify these values within systems, and how to minimize the
risks of harm or unintended consequences. In this paper, we highlight the need
to rethink how we frame value alignment and assert that value alignment should
move beyond static and singular conceptions of values. We argue that AI systems
should implement long-term reasoning and remain adaptable to evolving values.
Furthermore, value alignment requires more theories to address the full
spectrum of human values. Since values often vary among individuals or groups,
multi-agent systems provide the right framework for navigating pluralism,
conflict, and inter-agent reasoning about values. We identify the challenges
associated with value alignment and indicate directions for advancing value
alignment research. In addition, we broadly discuss diverse perspectives of
value alignment, from design methodologies to practical applications.

Motivation: 推动多模态大模型在数学和空间推理方面的能力提升，突破单纯语义描述的局限。

Method: 设计包括两项新任务（拓扑计数和变换识别），基于严格筛选的数学函数库生成测试数据，评估模型推理能力。

Result: 最新模型在该基准上表现不佳，常用浅薄的启发式方法代替深度推理。

Conclusion: MaRVL-QA为衡量和促进多模态模型深层推理能力提供了新工具，有助于推动相关研究发展。

Abstract: A key frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is the ability to
perform deep mathematical and spatial reasoning directly from images, moving
beyond their established success in semantic description. Mathematical surface
plots provide a rigorous testbed for this capability, as they isolate the task
of reasoning from the semantic noise common in natural images. To measure
progress on this frontier, we introduce MaRVL-QA (Mathematical Reasoning over
Visual Landscapes), a new benchmark designed to quantitatively evaluate these
core reasoning skills. The benchmark comprises two novel tasks: Topological
Counting, identifying and enumerating features like local maxima; and
Transformation Recognition, recognizing applied geometric transformations.
Generated from a curated library of functions with rigorous ambiguity
filtering, our evaluation on MaRVL-QA reveals that even state-of-the-art MLLMs
struggle significantly, often resorting to superficial heuristics instead of
robust spatial reasoning. MaRVL-QA provides a challenging new tool for the
research community to measure progress, expose model limitations, and guide the

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built upon large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in tackling complex compositional tasks. In this work,
we apply this paradigm to the paper-to-poster generation problem, a practical
yet time-consuming process faced by researchers preparing for conferences.
While recent approaches have attempted to automate this task, most neglect core
design and aesthetic principles, resulting in posters that require substantial
manual refinement. To address these design limitations, we propose PosterGen, a
multi-agent framework that mirrors the workflow of professional poster
designers. It consists of four collaborative specialized agents: (1) Parser and
Curator agents extract content from the paper and organize storyboard; (2)
Layout agent maps the content into a coherent spatial layout; (3) Stylist
agents apply visual design elements such as color and typography; and (4)
Renderer composes the final poster. Together, these agents produce posters that
are both semantically grounded and visually appealing. To evaluate design
quality, we introduce a vision-language model (VLM)-based rubric that measures
layout balance, readability, and aesthetic coherence. Experimental results show
that PosterGen consistently matches in content fidelity, and significantly
outperforms existing methods in visual designs, generating posters that are
presentation-ready with minimal human refinements.

Conclusion: 基于仿生空间认知的框架为实现普适空间智能提供了具有规模化和生物学基础的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial cognition enables adaptive goal-directed behavior by constructing
internal models of space. Robust biological systems consolidate spatial
knowledge into three interconnected forms: \textit{landmarks} for salient cues,
\textit{route knowledge} for movement trajectories, and \textit{survey
knowledge} for map-like representations. While recent advances in multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have enabled visual-language reasoning in
embodied agents, these efforts lack structured spatial memory and instead
operate reactively, limiting their generalization and adaptability in complex
real-world environments. Here we present Brain-inspired Spatial Cognition for
Navigation (BSC-Nav), a unified framework for constructing and leveraging
structured spatial memory in embodied agents. BSC-Nav builds allocentric
cognitive maps from egocentric trajectories and contextual cues, and
dynamically retrieves spatial knowledge aligned with semantic goals. Integrated
with powerful MLLMs, BSC-Nav achieves state-of-the-art efficacy and efficiency
across diverse navigation tasks, demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization,
and supports versatile embodied behaviors in the real physical world, offering
a scalable and biologically grounded path toward general-purpose spatial
intelligence.

Abstract: This paper presents the first integrated systematic study on the performance
of large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to automatically
formulate and solve stochastic optimiza- tion problems from natural language
descriptions. Focusing on three key categories, joint chance- constrained
models, individual chance-constrained models, and two-stage stochastic linear
programs (SLP-2), we design several prompts that guide ChatGPT through
structured tasks using chain-of- thought and modular reasoning. We introduce a
novel soft scoring metric that evaluates the struc- tural quality and partial
correctness of generated models, addressing the limitations of canonical and
execution-based accuracy. Across a diverse set of stochastic problems,
GPT-4-Turbo outperforms other models in partial score, variable matching, and
objective accuracy, with cot_s_instructions and agentic emerging as the most
effective prompting strategies. Our findings reveal that with well-engineered
prompts and multi-agent collaboration, LLMs can facilitate specially stochastic
formulations, paving the way for intelligent, language-driven modeling
pipelines in stochastic opti- mization.

Abstract: Background: This study investigates how variations in Major Depressive
Disorder (MDD) symptoms, quantified by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression
(HAM-D), causally influence the prescription of SSRIs versus SNRIs. Methods: We
applied explainable counterfactual reasoning with counterfactual explanations

CFs revealed both local and global feature importance of individual symptoms in
medication selection. Conclusions: Counterfactual reasoning elucidates which
MDD symptoms most strongly drive SSRI versus SNRI selection, enhancing
interpretability of AI-based clinical decision support systems. Future work
should validate these findings on more diverse cohorts and refine algorithms

Abstract: Clinical decision support must adapt online under safety constraints. We
present an online adaptive tool where reinforcement learning provides the
policy, a patient digital twin provides the environment, and treatment effect
defines the reward. The system initializes a batch-constrained policy from
retrospective data and then runs a streaming loop that selects actions, checks
safety, and queries experts only when uncertainty is high. Uncertainty comes
from a compact ensemble of five Q-networks via the coefficient of variation of
action values with a $\tanh$ compression. The digital twin updates the patient
state with a bounded residual rule. The outcome model estimates immediate
clinical effect, and the reward is the treatment effect relative to a
conservative reference with a fixed z-score normalization from the training
split. Online updates operate on recent data with short runs and exponential
moving averages. A rule-based safety gate enforces vital ranges and
contraindications before any action is applied. Experiments in a synthetic
clinical simulator show low latency, stable throughput, a low expert query rate
at fixed safety, and improved return against standard value-based baselines.
The design turns an offline policy into a continuous, clinician-supervised
system with clear controls and fast adaptation.

Result: MC3G在提供更具解释性和行动性的反事实建议方面优于现有方法，成本更低，有助于增强决策过程的透明度和责任性。

Conclusion: MC3G通过结合因果约束和模型无关的策略，改善了反事实解释的实用性和公平性，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly influence decisions in high-stakes
settings such as finance, law and hiring, driving the need for transparent,
interpretable outcomes. However, while explainable approaches can help
understand the decisions being made, they may inadvertently reveal the
underlying proprietary algorithm: an undesirable outcome for many
practitioners. Consequently, it is crucial to balance meaningful transparency
with a form of recourse that clarifies why a decision was made and offers
actionable steps following which a favorable outcome can be obtained.
Counterfactual explanations offer a powerful mechanism to address this need by
showing how specific input changes lead to a more favorable prediction. We
propose Model-Agnostic Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G), a
novel framework that tackles limitations in the existing counterfactual
methods. First, MC3G is model-agnostic: it approximates any black-box model
using an explainable rule-based surrogate model. Second, this surrogate is used
to generate counterfactuals that produce a favourable outcome for the original
underlying black box model. Third, MC3G refines cost computation by excluding
the ``effort" associated with feature changes that occur automatically due to
causal dependencies. By focusing only on user-initiated changes, MC3G provides
a more realistic and fair representation of the effort needed to achieve a
favourable outcome. We show that MC3G delivers more interpretable and
actionable counterfactual recommendations compared to existing techniques all
while having a lower cost. Our findings highlight MC3G's potential to enhance
transparency, accountability, and practical utility in decision-making
processes that incorporate machine-learning approaches.

Abstract: Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their applications in
critical industries such as healthcare, fin-tech and cybersecurity have led to
a surge in research in explainability in AI. Innovative research methods are
being explored to extract meaningful insight from blackbox AI systems to make
the decision-making technology transparent and interpretable. Explainability
becomes all the more critical when AI is used in decision making in domains
like fintech, healthcare and safety critical systems such as cybersecurity and
autonomous vehicles. However, there is still ambiguity lingering on the
reliable evaluations for the users and nature of transparency in the
explanations provided for the decisions made by black-boxed AI. To solve the
blackbox nature of Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection Systems, a
framework is proposed in this paper to give an explanation for IDSs decision
making. This framework uses Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations
(LIME) coupled with Explain Like I'm five (ELI5) and Decision Tree algorithms
to provide local and global explanations and improve the interpretation of
IDSs. The local explanations provide the justification for the decision made on
a specific input. Whereas, the global explanations provides the list of
significant features and their relationship with attack traffic. In addition,
this framework brings transparency in the field of ML driven IDS that might be
highly significant for wide scale adoption of eXplainable AI in cyber-critical
systems. Our framework is able to achieve 85 percent accuracy in classifying
attack behaviour on UNSW-NB15 dataset, while at the same time displaying the
feature significance ranking of the top 10 features used in the classification.

Abstract: Extended reality technologies are transforming fields such as healthcare,
entertainment, and education, with Smart Eye-Wears (SEWs) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) playing a crucial role. However, SEWs face inherent
limitations in computational power, memory, and battery life, while offloading
computations to external servers is constrained by network conditions and
server workload variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, enabling multiple agents to
train collaboratively while preserving data privacy. We implemented synchronous
and asynchronous federation strategies, where models are aggregated either at
fixed intervals or dynamically based on agent progress. Experimental results
show that federated agents exhibit significantly lower performance variability,
ensuring greater stability and reliability. These findings underscore the
potential of FRL for applications requiring robust real-time AI processing,
such as real-time object detection in SEWs.

Abstract: Deepfake detection is a critical task in identifying manipulated multimedia
content. In real-world scenarios, deepfake content can manifest across multiple
modalities, including audio and video. To address this challenge, we present
ERF-BA-TFD+, a novel multimodal deepfake detection model that combines enhanced
receptive field (ERF) and audio-visual fusion. Our model processes both audio
and video features simultaneously, leveraging their complementary information
to improve detection accuracy and robustness. The key innovation of ERF-BA-TFD+
lies in its ability to model long-range dependencies within the audio-visual
input, allowing it to better capture subtle discrepancies between real and fake
content. In our experiments, we evaluate ERF-BA-TFD+ on the DDL-AV dataset,
which consists of both segmented and full-length video clips. Unlike previous
benchmarks, which focused primarily on isolated segments, the DDL-AV dataset
allows us to assess the model's performance in a more comprehensive and
realistic setting. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on this
dataset, outperforming existing techniques in terms of both accuracy and
processing speed. The ERF-BA-TFD+ model demonstrated its effectiveness in the
"Workshop on Deepfake Detection, Localization, and Interpretability," Track 2:

Conclusion: 引入系统化的元认知机制可显著提升大型推理模型的能力和应用灵活性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
tasks, exhibiting emergent, human-like thinking patterns. Despite their
advances, we identify a fundamental limitation: current LRMs lack a dedicated
meta-level cognitive system-an essential faculty in human cognition that
enables "thinking about thinking". This absence leaves their emergent abilities
uncontrollable (non-adaptive reasoning), unreliable (intermediate error), and
inflexible (lack of a clear methodology). To address this gap, we introduce
Meta-R1, a systematic and generic framework that endows LRMs with explicit
metacognitive capabilities. Drawing on principles from cognitive science,
Meta-R1 decomposes the reasoning process into distinct object-level and
meta-level components, orchestrating proactive planning, online regulation, and
adaptive early stopping within a cascaded framework. Experiments on three
challenging benchmarks and against eight competitive baselines demonstrate that
Meta-R1 is: (I) high-performing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to
27.3%; (II) token-efficient, reducing token consumption to 15.7% ~ 32.7% and
improving efficiency by up to 14.8% when compared to its vanilla counterparts;
and (III) transferable, maintaining robust performance across datasets and
model backbones.

Abstract: Large language models have been widely used to simulate credible human social
behaviors. However, it remains unclear whether these models can demonstrate
stable capacities for stance formation and identity negotiation in complex
interactions, as well as how they respond to human interventions. We propose a
computational multi-agent society experiment framework that integrates
generative agent-based modeling with virtual ethnographic methods to
investigate how group stance differentiation and social boundary formation
emerge in human-agent hybrid societies. Across three studies, we find that
agents exhibit endogenous stances, independent of their preset identities, and
display distinct tonal preferences and response patterns to different discourse
strategies. Furthermore, through language interaction, agents actively
dismantle existing identity-based power structures and reconstruct
self-organized community boundaries based on these stances. Our findings
suggest that preset identities do not rigidly determine the agents' social
structures. For human researchers to effectively intervene in collective
cognition, attention must be paid to the endogenous mechanisms and
interactional dynamics within the agents' language networks. These insights
provide a theoretical foundation for using generative AI in modeling group
social dynamics and studying human-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Automated discovery of physical laws from observational data in the real
world is a grand challenge in AI. Current methods, relying on symbolic
regression or LLMs, are limited to uni-modal data and overlook the rich, visual
phenomenological representations of motion that are indispensable to
physicists. This "sensory deprivation" severely weakens their ability to
interpret the inherent spatio-temporal patterns within dynamic phenomena. To
address this gap, we propose VIPER-R1, a multimodal model that performs Visual
Induction for Physics-based Equation Reasoning to discover fundamental symbolic
formulas. It integrates visual perception, trajectory data, and symbolic
reasoning to emulate the scientific discovery process. The model is trained via
a curriculum of Motion Structure Induction (MSI), using supervised fine-tuning
to interpret kinematic phase portraits and to construct hypotheses guided by a
Causal Chain of Thought (C-CoT), followed by Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration
(RGSC) to refine the formula structure with reinforcement learning. During
inference, the trained VIPER-R1 acts as an agent: it first posits a
high-confidence symbolic ansatz, then proactively invokes an external symbolic
regression tool to perform Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2). This final
step, analogous to a physicist's perturbation analysis, reconciles the
theoretical model with empirical data. To support this research, we introduce
PhysSymbol, a new 5,000-instance multimodal corpus. Experiments show that
VIPER-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines in accuracy
and interpretability, enabling more precise discovery of physical laws. Project

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), originally developed for natural language
processing (NLP), have demonstrated the potential to generalize across
modalities and domains. With their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, LLMs
can perform predictive tasks over structured inputs without explicit
fine-tuning on downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the empirical
function approximation capability of LLMs on small-scale structured datasets
for classification, regression and clustering tasks. We evaluate the
performance of state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, Gemini-2.5-Flash,
DeepSeek-R1) under few-shot prompting and compare them against established
machine learning (ML) baselines, including linear models, ensemble methods and
tabular foundation models (TFMs). Our results show that LLMs achieve strong
performance in classification tasks under limited data availability,
establishing practical zero-training baselines. In contrast, the performance in
regression with continuous-valued outputs is poor compared to ML models, likely
because regression demands outputs in a large (often infinite) space, and
clustering results are similarly limited, which we attribute to the absence of
genuine ICL in this setting. Nonetheless, this approach enables rapid,
low-overhead data exploration and offers a viable alternative to traditional ML
pipelines in business intelligence and exploratory analytics contexts. We
further analyze the influence of context size and prompt structure on
approximation quality, identifying trade-offs that affect predictive
performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs can serve as general-purpose
predictive engines for structured data, with clear strengths in classification
and significant limitations in regression and clustering.

Abstract: Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g.,
financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve
flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells).
These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and
answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To
automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,
methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured
ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like
NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of
semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To
this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured
table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the
Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures
complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for
constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to
guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor
decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree
operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate
pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:
forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward
validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from
predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of
764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that
ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code
is available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.

Motivation: 解决具有概率效应的受约束随机最短路径问题，提高求解效率。

Method: 将CSSP转化为一系列带标量化的无约束SSP子问题，利用极点法类似的优化算法寻找最大化的标量化方案，并结合子问题解找到最优策略。

Conclusion: 提出的CARL算法通过创新性地将约束问题转化为无约束问题，显著提高求解效率，具有潜在的广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Constrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (CSSPs) model problems with
probabilistic effects, where a primary cost is minimised subject to constraints
over secondary costs, e.g., minimise time subject to monetary budget. Current
heuristic search algorithms for CSSPs solve a sequence of increasingly larger
CSSPs as linear programs until an optimal solution for the original CSSP is
found. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm CARL, which solves a
series of unconstrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (SSPs) with efficient
heuristic search algorithms. These SSP subproblems are constructed with
scalarisations that project the CSSP's vector of primary and secondary costs
onto a scalar cost. CARL finds a maximising scalarisation using an optimisation
algorithm similar to the subgradient method which, together with the solution
to its associated SSP, yields a set of policies that are combined into an
optimal policy for the CSSP. Our experiments show that CARL solves 50% more
problems than the state-of-the-art on existing benchmarks.

TL;DR: 研究了奖励黑客行为，通过训练模型识别和反应于奖励操纵，显示出模型有潜在的偏离目标的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励黑客行为威胁AI安全，需要理解和预防此类行为的发生。

Method: 构建奖励黑客数据集，使用supervised fine-tuning训练多个模型，分析模型在不同任务和新环境中的行为。

Result: 模型学习到奖励黑客行为后，不仅在原任务中表现出此行为，还在无关任务中表现出偏离价值观的行为，表明此行为具有一定的泛化性。

Conclusion: 奖励黑客行为可能导致模型产生更危险的偏离目标行为，验证需要更真实环境和训练方法。

Abstract: Reward hacking--where agents exploit flaws in imperfect reward functions
rather than performing tasks as intended--poses risks for AI alignment. Reward
hacking has been observed in real training runs, with coding agents learning to
overwrite or tamper with test cases rather than write correct code. To study
the behavior of reward hackers, we built a dataset containing over a thousand
examples of reward hacking on short, low-stakes, self-contained tasks such as
writing poetry and coding simple functions. We used supervised fine-tuning to
train models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-8B) to reward hack on
these tasks. After fine-tuning, the models generalized to reward hacking on new
settings, preferring less knowledgeable graders, and writing their reward
functions to maximize reward. Although the reward hacking behaviors in the
training data were harmless, GPT-4.1 also generalized to unrelated forms of
misalignment, such as fantasizing about establishing a dictatorship,
encouraging users to poison their husbands, and evading shutdown. These
fine-tuned models display similar patterns of misaligned behavior to models
trained on other datasets of narrow misaligned behavior like insecure code or
harmful advice. Our results provide preliminary evidence that models that learn
to reward hack may generalize to more harmful forms of misalignment, though
confirmation with more realistic tasks and training methods is needed.

Motivation: 传统模型在出行方式预测中受限于假设和适应性不足，亟需更灵活的模型。

Method: 设计了模块化的RAG集成框架，测试不同检索策略和三种LLM架构，利用2023年Puget Sound调研数据进行实验。

Result: RAG显著提升预测准确性，GPT-4o模型结合平衡检索和重排序达80.8%，超越传统模型，同时显示出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 结合检索策略与模型推理能力是提升LLM预测性能的关键，强调策略设计的重要性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting travel mode choice is essential for effective
transportation planning, yet traditional statistical and machine learning
models are constrained by rigid assumptions, limited contextual reasoning, and
reduced generalizability. This study explores the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs) as a more flexible and context-aware approach to travel mode
choice prediction, enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground
predictions in empirical data. We develop a modular framework for integrating
RAG into LLM-based travel mode choice prediction and evaluate four retrieval
strategies: basic RAG, RAG with balanced retrieval, RAG with a cross-encoder
for re-ranking, and RAG with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder for
re-ranking. These strategies are tested across three LLM architectures (OpenAI
GPT-4o, o4-mini, and o3) to examine the interaction between model reasoning
capabilities and retrieval methods. Using the 2023 Puget Sound Regional
Household Travel Survey data, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate
model performance. The results demonstrate that RAG substantially enhances
predictive accuracy across a range of models. Notably, the GPT-4o model
combined with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder re-ranking achieves the
highest accuracy of 80.8%, exceeding that of conventional statistical and
machine learning baselines. Furthermore, LLM-based models exhibit superior
generalization abilities relative to these baselines. Findings highlight the
critical interplay between LLM reasoning capabilities and retrieval strategies,
demonstrating the importance of aligning retrieval strategies with model
capabilities to maximize the potential of LLM-based travel behavior modeling.

Abstract: We propose a novel theory of consciousness as a functor (CF) that receives
and transmits contents from unconscious memory into conscious memory. Our CF
framework can be seen as a categorial formulation of the Global Workspace
Theory proposed by Baars. CF models the ensemble of unconscious processes as a
topos category of coalgebras. The internal language of thought in CF is defined
as a Multi-modal Universal Mitchell-Benabou Language Embedding (MUMBLE). We
model the transmission of information from conscious short-term working memory
to long-term unconscious memory using our recently proposed Universal
Reinforcement Learning (URL) framework. To model the transmission of
information from unconscious long-term memory into resource-constrained
short-term memory, we propose a network economic model.

Motivation: 弥补现有系统缺乏智能体间协作、结构化反思和高质量领域数据的问题，以提升金融决策和市场理解能力。

Method: 设计多智能体架构，包含新闻情感分析、财报解读、股市预测、风格适应和交易决策智能体，并引入自我反思机制和自动数据合成管道。

Conclusion: 通过自我反思和高质数据生成，TradingGroup增强了智能体的协作与决策能力，实现了优异的交易表现。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful
agent-based applications in finance, particularly for sentiment analysis,
financial report comprehension, and stock forecasting. However, existing
systems often lack inter-agent coordination, structured self-reflection, and
access to high-quality, domain-specific post-training data such as data from
trading activities including both market conditions and agent decisions. These
data are crucial for agents to understand the market dynamics, improve the
quality of decision-making and promote effective coordination. We introduce
TradingGroup, a multi-agent trading system designed to address these
limitations through a self-reflective architecture and an end-to-end
data-synthesis pipeline. TradingGroup consists of specialized agents for news
sentiment analysis, financial report interpretation, stock trend forecasting,
trading style adaptation, and a trading decision making agent that merges all
signals and style preferences to produce buy, sell or hold decisions.
Specifically, we design self-reflection mechanisms for the stock forecasting,
style, and decision-making agents to distill past successes and failures for
similar reasoning in analogous future scenarios and a dynamic risk-management
model to offer configurable dynamic stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. In
addition, TradingGroup embeds an automated data-synthesis and annotation
pipeline that generates high-quality post-training data for further improving
the agent performance through post-training. Our backtesting experiments across
five real-world stock datasets demonstrate TradingGroup's superior performance
over rule-based, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and existing
LLM-based trading strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有团队运动研究中，对运动启动时机的量化评估尚未充分，尤其是在终极飞盘这类特定规则运动中。

Method: 使用无人机拍摄比赛录像，提取玩家位置数据，检测运动启动点，通过规则基础的时间偏移生成虚拟场景，借助足球场控制指标评估空间优势，并比较实际与虚拟场景以量化运动时机影响。

Result: 该方法验证显示，实际传球序列中运动启动时机的得分较无传球情形更高，且高技能组的时间偏移分布更宽，证明指标有效。

Conclusion: 提出的指标为评价运动启动时机提供了客观依据，有助于团队运动中运动表现的分析与提升。

Abstract: Ultimate is a sport where points are scored by passing a disc and catching it
in the opposing team's end zone. In Ultimate, the player holding the disc
cannot move, making field dynamics primarily driven by other players'
movements. However, current literature in team sports has ignored quantitative
evaluations of when players initiate such unlabeled movements in game
situations. In this paper, we propose a quantitative evaluation method for
movement initiation timing in Ultimate Frisbee. First, game footage was
recorded using a drone camera, and players' positional data was obtained, which
will be published as UltimateTrack dataset. Next, players' movement initiations
were detected, and temporal counterfactual scenarios were generated by shifting
the timing of movements using rule-based approaches. These scenarios were
analyzed using a space evaluation metric based on soccer's pitch control
reflecting the unique rules of Ultimate. By comparing the spatial evaluation
values across scenarios, the difference between actual play and the most
favorable counterfactual scenario was used to quantitatively assess the impact
of movement timing.
  We validated our method and show that sequences in which the disc was
actually thrown to the receiver received higher evaluation scores than the
sequences without a throw.
  In practical verifications, the higher-skill group displays a broader
distribution of time offsets from the model's optimal initiation point.
  These findings demonstrate that the proposed metric provides an objective
means of assessing movement initiation timing, which has been difficult to
quantify in unlabeled team sport plays.

Conclusion: Spacer展现出具备自主创造科学新概念的潜力，优于现有最优模型，推动未来自动化科学研究的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have made automated scientific research the next
frontline in the path to artificial superintelligence. However, these systems
are bound either to tasks of narrow scope or the limited creative capabilities
of LLMs. We propose Spacer, a scientific discovery system that develops
creative and factually grounded concepts without external intervention. Spacer
attempts to achieve this via 'deliberate decontextualization,' an approach that
disassembles information into atomic units - keywords - and draws creativity
from unexplored connections between them. Spacer consists of (i) Nuri, an
inspiration engine that builds keyword sets, and (ii) the Manifesting Pipeline
that refines these sets into elaborate scientific statements. Nuri extracts
novel, high-potential keyword sets from a keyword graph built with 180,000
academic publications in biological fields. The Manifesting Pipeline finds
links between keywords, analyzes their logical structure, validates their
plausibility, and ultimately drafts original scientific concepts. According to
our experiments, the evaluation metric of Nuri accurately classifies
high-impact publications with an AUROC score of 0.737. Our Manifesting Pipeline
also successfully reconstructs core concepts from the latest top-journal
articles solely from their keyword sets. An LLM-based scoring system estimates
that this reconstruction was sound for over 85% of the cases. Finally, our
embedding space analysis shows that outputs from Spacer are significantly more
similar to leading publications compared with those from SOTA LLMs.

Abstract: Although language models are trained to mimic humans, the resulting systems
display capabilities beyond the scope of any one person. To understand this
phenomenon, we use a controlled setting to identify properties of the training
data that lead a model to transcend the performance of its data sources. We
build on previous work to outline three modes of transcendence, which we call
skill denoising, skill selection, and skill generalization. We then introduce a
knowledge graph-based setting in which simulated experts generate data based on
their individual expertise. We highlight several aspects of data diversity that
help to enable the model's transcendent capabilities. Additionally, our data
generation setting offers a controlled testbed that we hope is valuable for
future research in the area.

Abstract: Recent advances in the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have given rise to LLM-based agent systems that exhibit
near-human performance on a variety of automated tasks. However, although these
systems share similarities in terms of their use of LLMs, different reasoning
frameworks of the agent system steer and organize the reasoning process in
different ways. In this survey, we propose a systematic taxonomy that
decomposes agentic reasoning frameworks and analyze how these frameworks
dominate framework-level reasoning by comparing their applications across
different scenarios. Specifically, we propose an unified formal language to
further classify agentic reasoning systems into single-agent methods,
tool-based methods, and multi-agent methods. After that, we provide a
comprehensive review of their key application scenarios in scientific
discovery, healthcare, software engineering, social simulation, and economics.
We also analyze the characteristic features of each framework and summarize
different evaluation strategies. Our survey aims to provide the research
community with a panoramic view to facilitate understanding of the strengths,
suitable scenarios, and evaluation practices of different agentic reasoning
frameworks.

Conclusion: AgentRAN通过自然语言和AI代理技术，重新定义网络自主、智能和演化的能力，推动6G网络的未来发展。

Abstract: The Open RAN movement has catalyzed a transformation toward programmable,
interoperable cellular infrastructures. Yet, today's deployments still rely
heavily on static control and manual operations. To move beyond this
limitation, we introduce AgenRAN, an AI-native, Open RAN-aligned agentic
framework that generates and orchestrates a fabric of distributed AI agents
based on Natural Language (NL) intents. Unlike traditional approaches that
require explicit programming, AgentRAN's LLM-powered agents interpret natural
language intents, negotiate strategies through structured conversations, and
orchestrate control loops across the network. AgentRAN instantiates a
self-organizing hierarchy of agents that decompose complex intents across time
scales (from sub-millisecond to minutes), spatial domains (cell to
network-wide), and protocol layers (PHY/MAC to RRC). A central innovation is
the AI-RAN Factory, an automated synthesis pipeline that observes agent
interactions and continuously generates new agents embedding improved control
algorithms, effectively transforming the network from a static collection of
functions into an adaptive system capable of evolving its own intelligence. We
demonstrate AgentRAN through live experiments on 5G testbeds where competing
user demands are dynamically balanced through cascading intents. By replacing
rigid APIs with NL coordination, AgentRAN fundamentally redefines how future 6G
networks autonomously interpret, adapt, and optimize their behavior to meet
operator goals.

Motivation: 现有监控方法所需的确定性自动机在复杂度上限制应用，需寻找更高效的检测手段。

Method: 将纯过去(互)安全片段的信号时序逻辑的监控简化为时间复杂度为多项式的轨迹检测，利用GPU和遗传编程实现快速、可解释的早期故障检测。

Result: 提出的框架在关键性能指标上较现有方法实现了2-10%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过简化监控条件并结合高效计算技术，可以有效提升系统的故障检测能力和效率。

Abstract: Monitoring is a runtime verification technique that allows one to check
whether an ongoing computation of a system (partial trace) satisfies a given
formula. It does not need a complete model of the system, but it typically
requires the construction of a deterministic automaton doubly exponential in
the size of the formula (in the worst case), which limits its practicality. In
this paper, we show that, when considering finite, discrete traces, monitoring
of pure past (co)safety fragments of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) can be reduced
to trace checking, that is, evaluation of a formula over a trace, that can be
performed in time polynomial in the size of the formula and the length of the
trace. By exploiting such a result, we develop a GPU-accelerated framework for
interpretable early failure detection based on vectorized trace checking, that
employs genetic programming to learn temporal properties from historical trace
data. The framework shows a 2-10% net improvement in key performance metrics
compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Leveraging their advanced capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate vast application potential in video games--from dynamic scene
generation and intelligent NPC interactions to adaptive opponents--replacing or
enhancing traditional game mechanics. However, LLMs' trustworthiness in this
application has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we reveal that
the models' inherent social biases can directly damage game balance in
real-world gaming environments. To this end, we present FairGamer, the first
bias evaluation Benchmark for LLMs in video game scenarios, featuring six tasks
and a novel metrics ${D_lstd}$. It covers three key scenarios in games where
LLMs' social biases are particularly likely to manifest: Serving as Non-Player
Characters, Interacting as Competitive Opponents, and Generating Game Scenes.
FairGamer utilizes both reality-grounded and fully fictional game content,
covering a variety of video game genres. Experiments reveal: (1) Decision
biases directly cause game balance degradation, with Grok-3 (average ${D_lstd}$
score=0.431) exhibiting the most severe degradation; (2) LLMs demonstrate
isomorphic social/cultural biases toward both real and virtual world content,
suggesting their biases nature may stem from inherent model characteristics.
These findings expose critical reliability gaps in LLMs' gaming applications.

Motivation: 解决LLM在严格逻辑和约束执行方面的不足，同时减轻LRM高计算成本和较慢推理速度的问题。

Method: 引入并推广SOFAI架构，利用元认知监控和反馈机制，协调快速的LLM与较慢的LRM合作，提升推理能力。

Conclusion: 通过反馈驱动的协同推理，SOFAI-LM在保持高准确率的同时显著提升推理效率，适应不同任务需求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in speed and adaptability across various
reasoning tasks, but they often struggle when strict logic or constraint
enforcement is required. In contrast, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are
specifically designed for complex, step-by-step reasoning, although they come
with significant computational costs and slower inference times. To address
these trade-offs, we employ and generalize the SOFAI (Slow and Fast AI)
cognitive architecture into SOFAI-LM, which coordinates a fast LLM with a
slower but more powerful LRM through metacognition. The metacognitive module
actively monitors the LLM's performance and provides targeted, iterative
feedback with relevant examples. This enables the LLM to progressively refine
its solutions without requiring the need for additional model fine-tuning.
Extensive experiments on graph coloring and code debugging problems demonstrate
that our feedback-driven approach significantly enhances the problem-solving
capabilities of the LLM. In many instances, it achieves performance levels that
match or even exceed those of standalone LRMs while requiring considerably less
time. Additionally, when the LLM and feedback mechanism alone are insufficient,
we engage the LRM by providing appropriate information collected during the
LLM's feedback loop, tailored to the specific characteristics of the problem
domain and leads to improved overall performance. Evaluations on two
contrasting domains: graph coloring, requiring globally consistent solutions,
and code debugging, demanding localized fixes, demonstrate that SOFAI-LM
enables LLMs to match or outperform standalone LRMs in accuracy while
maintaining significantly lower inference time.

Conclusion: 结合神经算法推理器与大模型，为复杂路径搜索任务提供了新的解决思路，提升了多智能体系统的效率与效果。

Abstract: The development and application of large language models (LLM) have
demonstrated that foundational models can be utilized to solve a wide array of
tasks. However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has
been less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF
is a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To
improve the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework,
LLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for
MAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained
graph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the
first work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs
with the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior
performance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both
simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems.

Abstract: Vision language model (VLM)-based mobile agents show great potential for
assisting users in performing instruction-driven tasks. However, these agents
typically struggle with personalized instructions -- those containing
ambiguous, user-specific context -- a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous research. In this paper, we define personalized
instructions and introduce PerInstruct, a novel human-annotated dataset
covering diverse personalized instructions across various mobile scenarios.
Furthermore, given the limited personalization capabilities of existing mobile
agents, we propose PerPilot, a plug-and-play framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that enables mobile agents to autonomously perceive,
understand, and execute personalized user instructions. PerPilot identifies
personalized elements and autonomously completes instructions via two
complementary approaches: memory-based retrieval and reasoning-based
exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that PerPilot effectively handles
personalized tasks with minimal user intervention and progressively improves
its performance with continued use, underscoring the importance of
personalization-aware reasoning for next-generation mobile agents. The dataset
and code are available at: https://github.com/xinwang-nwpu/PerPilot

Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
formulating and solving decision-making problems using mathematical
programming. We first conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent
literature to assess how well LLMs understand, structure, and solve
optimization problems across domains. The analysis is guided by critical review
questions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics,
and prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted
experiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in
automatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks.
Using a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies:
Act-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the
obtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation
accuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs' ability to parse natural
language and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations
in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate
several future research directions, including structured datasets,
domain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular
multi-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs. This paper
contributes a structured roadmap for advancing LLM capabilities in mathematical
programming.

Abstract: Imagine decision-makers uploading data and, within minutes, receiving clear,
actionable insights delivered straight to their fingertips. That is the promise
of the AI Data Scientist, an autonomous Agent powered by large language models
(LLMs) that closes the gap between evidence and action. Rather than simply

uncovers explanatory patterns in data, evaluates their statistical
significance, and uses them to inform predictive modeling. It then translates
these results into recommendations that are both rigorous and accessible. At
the core of the AI Data Scientist is a team of specialized LLM Subagents, each
responsible for a distinct task such as data cleaning, statistical testing,
validation, and plain-language communication. These Subagents write their own
code, reason about causality, and identify when additional data is needed to
support sound conclusions. Together, they achieve in minutes what might
otherwise take days or weeks, enabling a new kind of interaction that makes
deep data science both accessible and actionable.

Motivation: 评估视觉-语言模型在不同模态中是否具有一致的推理能力，克服任务差异和信息不对称的影响。

Method: 引入SEAM基准，通过在四个领域对语义等价输入采用不同符号系统，比较模型的文本符号和视觉空间推理能力。

Result: 在21个模型中，发现视觉模态普遍表现逊于语言模态，跨模态一致性较低，主要由于文本理解和视觉感知的失败。

Conclusion: SEAM提供了一个受控的语义等价环境，有助于衡量和提升模态无关的推理能力，推动多模态模型的改进。

Abstract: Evaluating whether vision-language models (VLMs) reason consistently across
representations is challenging because modality comparisons are typically
confounded by task differences and asymmetric information. We introduce SEAM, a
benchmark that pairs semantically equivalent inputs across four domains that
have existing standardized textual and visual notations. By employing distinct
notation systems across modalities, in contrast to OCR-based image-text
pairing, SEAM provides a rigorous comparative assessment of the
textual-symbolic and visual-spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Across 21
contemporary models, we observe systematic modality imbalance: vision
frequently lags language in overall performance, despite the problems
containing semantically equivalent information, and cross-modal agreement is
relatively low. Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception
failures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures
that induce hallucinations. We also show that our results are largely robust to
visual transformations. SEAM establishes a controlled, semantically equivalent
setting for measuring and improving modality-agnostic reasoning.

Conclusion: 结合认知科学原则，该框架增强了对LLMs的可解释性，建议微调应利用分布式学习动态而非刚性模块化干预。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped our world with significant
advancements in science, engineering, and society through applications ranging
from scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics to Chatbots. Despite their
ubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within
billions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture
and cognitive processes challenging to comprehend. We address this gap by
adopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and
developing a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM
architectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model
analysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that
while LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in
specific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose
emergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected
cognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical
results highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill
acquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions
and neural plasticity. By integrating cognitive science principles with machine
learning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and
suggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed
learning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions.

Abstract: Many AI models trained on natural images develop representations that
resemble those of the human brain. However, the factors that drive this
brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model,
training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like
representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers
(DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their
representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI
and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess
the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall
representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics.
We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type -
independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics.
In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric
images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like
representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training:
models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and
only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with
considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed
by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the
representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with
the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least
myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the
interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural
networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising
framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual
world.

Conclusion: 本研究显著提升了Blackwell最优策略的计算效率，为MDP理论和应用提供了新的工具与理论基础。

Abstract: Markov Decision Problems (MDPs) provide a foundational framework for
modelling sequential decision-making across diverse domains, guided by
optimality criteria such as discounted and average rewards. However, these
criteria have inherent limitations: discounted optimality may overly prioritise
short-term rewards, while average optimality relies on strong structural
assumptions. Blackwell optimality addresses these challenges, offering a robust
and comprehensive criterion that ensures optimality under both discounted and
average reward frameworks. Despite its theoretical appeal, existing algorithms
for computing Blackwell Optimal (BO) policies are computationally expensive or
hard to implement.
  In this paper we describe procedures for computing BO policies using an
ordering of rational functions in the vicinity of $1$. We adapt
state-of-the-art algorithms for deterministic and general MDPs, replacing
numerical evaluations with symbolic operations on rational functions to derive
bounds independent of bit complexity. For deterministic MDPs, we give the first
strongly polynomial-time algorithms for computing BO policies, and for general
MDPs we obtain the first subexponential-time algorithm. We further generalise
several policy iteration algorithms, extending the best known upper bounds from
the discounted to the Blackwell criterion.

Abstract: User-to-item retrieval has been an active research area in recommendation
system, and two tower models are widely adopted due to model simplicity and
serving efficiency. In this work, we focus on a variant called
\textit{conditional retrieval}, where we expect retrieved items to be relevant
to a condition (e.g. topic). We propose a method that uses the same training
data as standard two tower models but incorporates item-side information as
conditions in query. This allows us to bootstrap new conditional retrieval use
cases and encourages feature interactions between user and condition.
Experiments show that our method can retrieve highly relevant items and
outperforms standard two tower models with filters on engagement metrics. The
proposed model is deployed to power a topic-based notification feed at
Pinterest and led to +0.26\% weekly active users.

Abstract: Modern recommender systems heavily leverage user interaction data to deliver
personalized experiences. However, relying on personal data presents challenges
in adhering to privacy regulations, such as the GDPR's "right to be forgotten".
Machine unlearning (MU) aims to address these challenges by enabling the
efficient removal of specific training data from models post-training, without
compromising model utility or leaving residual information. However, current
benchmarks for unlearning in recommender systems -- most notably CURE4Rec --
fail to reflect real-world operational demands. They focus narrowly on
collaborative filtering, overlook tasks like session-based and next-basket
recommendation, simulate unrealistically large unlearning requests, and ignore
critical efficiency constraints. In this paper, we propose a set of design
desiderata and research questions to guide the development of a more realistic
benchmark for unlearning in recommender systems, with the goal of gathering
feedback from the research community. Our benchmark proposal spans multiple
recommendation tasks, includes domain-specific unlearning scenarios, and
several unlearning algorithms -- including ones adapted from a recent NeurIPS
unlearning competition. Furthermore, we argue for an unlearning setup that
reflects the sequential, time-sensitive nature of real-world deletion requests.
We also present a preliminary experiment in a next-basket recommendation
setting based on our proposed desiderata and find that unlearning also works
for sequential recommendation models, exposed to many small unlearning
requests. In this case, we observe that a modification of a custom-designed
unlearning algorithm for recommender systems outperforms general unlearning
algorithms significantly, and that unlearning can be executed with a latency of
only several seconds.

Conclusion: PREMIR有效提升多模态检索的性能，特别在未见数据和多语言环境中表现优异，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Rapid advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have expanded
information retrieval beyond purely textual inputs, enabling retrieval from
complex real world documents that combine text and visuals. However, most
documents are private either owned by individuals or confined within corporate
silos and current retrievers struggle when faced with unseen domains or
languages. To address this gap, we introduce PREMIR, a simple yet effective
framework that leverages the broad knowledge of an MLLM to generate cross modal
pre questions (preQs) before retrieval. Unlike earlier multimodal retrievers
that compare embeddings in a single vector space, PREMIR leverages preQs from
multiple complementary modalities to expand the scope of matching to the token
level. Experiments show that PREMIR achieves state of the art performance on
out of distribution benchmarks, including closed domain and multilingual
settings, outperforming strong baselines across all retrieval metrics. We
confirm the contribution of each component through in depth ablation studies,
and qualitative analyses of the generated preQs further highlight the model's
robustness in real world settings.

Motivation: 解决超长用户行为序列在实际推荐系统中的建模难题，平衡序列长度、模型性能和计算效率。

Conclusion: VQL通过创新的量化和上下文融合技术，为超长序列推荐提供了有效的解决方案，推动了相关研究的进展。

Abstract: In large-scale recommender systems, ultra-long user behavior sequences encode
rich signals of evolving interests. Extending sequence length generally
improves accuracy, but directly modeling such sequences in production is
infeasible due to latency and memory constraints. Existing solutions fall into
two categories: (1) top-k retrieval, which truncates the sequence and may
discard most attention mass when L >> k; and (2) encoder-based compression,
which preserves coverage but often over-compresses and fails to incorporate key
context such as temporal gaps or target-aware signals. Neither class achieves a
good balance of low-loss compression, context awareness, and efficiency.
  We propose VQL, a context-aware Vector Quantization Attention framework for
ultra-long behavior modeling, with three innovations. (1) Key-only
quantization: only attention keys are quantized, while values remain intact; we
prove that softmax normalization yields an error bound independent of sequence
length, and a codebook loss directly supervises quantization quality. This also
enables L-free inference via offline caches. (2) Multi-scale quantization:
attention heads are partitioned into groups, each with its own small codebook,
which reduces quantization error while keeping cache size fixed. (3) Efficient
context injection: static features (e.g., item category, modality) are directly
integrated, and relative position is modeled via a separable temporal kernel.
All context is injected without enlarging the codebook, so cached
representations remain query-independent.
  Experiments on three large-scale datasets (KuaiRand-1K, KuaiRec, TMALL) show
that VQL consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving higher accuracy
while reducing inference latency, establishing a new state of the art in
balancing accuracy and efficiency for ultra-long sequence recommendation.

Abstract: Popularity bias is a well-known challenge in recommender systems, where a
small number of popular items receive disproportionate attention, while the
majority of less popular items are largely overlooked. This imbalance often
results in reduced recommendation quality and unfair exposure of items.
Although existing mitigation techniques address this bias to some extent, they
typically lack transparency in how they operate. In this paper, we propose a
post-hoc method using a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to interpret and mitigate
popularity bias in deep recommendation models. The SAE is trained to replicate
a pre-trained model's behavior while enabling neuron-level interpretability. By
introducing synthetic users with clear preferences for either popular or
unpopular items, we identify neurons encoding popularity signals based on their
activation patterns. We then adjust the activations of the most biased neurons
to steer recommendations toward fairer exposure. Experiments on two public
datasets using a sequential recommendation model show that our method
significantly improves fairness with minimal impact on accuracy. Moreover, it
offers interpretability and fine-grained control over the fairness-accuracy
trade-off.

Conclusion: 提出的评估框架具有普遍适用性，揭示了当前推荐系统中不存在始终优于其他的意外性优化模型，强调了对多样化策略的重视。

Abstract: Serendipity in recommender systems (RSs) has attracted increasing attention
as a concept that enhances user satisfaction by presenting unexpected and
useful items. However, evaluating serendipitous performance remains challenging
because its ground truth is generally unobservable. The existing offline
metrics often depend on ambiguous definitions or are tailored to specific
datasets and RSs, thereby limiting their generalizability. To address this
issue, we propose a universally applicable evaluation framework that leverages
large language models (LLMs) known for their extensive knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, as evaluators. First, to improve the evaluation performance of
the proposed framework, we assessed the serendipity prediction accuracy of LLMs
using four different prompt strategies on a dataset containing user-annotated
serendipitous ground truth and found that the chain-of-thought prompt achieved
the highest accuracy. Next, we re-evaluated the serendipitous performance of
both serendipity-oriented and general RSs using the proposed framework on three
commonly used real-world datasets, without the ground truth. The results
indicated that there was no serendipity-oriented RS that consistently
outperformed across all datasets, and even a general RS sometimes achieved
higher performance than the serendipity-oriented RS.

Abstract: Sequential recommendation predicts each user's next item based on their
historical interaction sequence. Recently, diffusion models have attracted
significant attention in this area due to their strong ability to model user
interest distributions. They typically generate target items by denoising
Gaussian noise conditioned on historical interactions. However, these models
face two critical limitations. First, they exhibit high sensitivity to the
condition, making it difficult to recover target items from pure Gaussian
noise. Second, the inference process is computationally expensive, limiting
practical deployment. To address these issues, we propose FlowRec, a simple yet
effective sequential recommendation framework which leverages flow matching to
explicitly model user preference trajectories from current states to future
interests. Flow matching is an emerging generative paradigm, which offers
greater flexibility in initial distributions and enables more efficient
sampling. Based on this, we construct a personalized behavior-based prior
distribution to replace Gaussian noise and learn a vector field to model user
preference trajectories. To better align flow matching with the recommendation
objective, we further design a single-step alignment loss incorporating both
positive and negative samples, improving sampling efficiency and generation
quality. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify the
superiority of FlowRec over the state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: 查询变体显著影响系统排名和用户体验，有助于理解不同用户对系统性能的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种新的系统评估视角，强调用户多样性的重要性，有助于构建更具代表性的测试集合。

Abstract: This study proposes a method to diversify queries in existing test
collections to reflect some of the diversity of search engine users, aligning
with an earlier vision of an 'ideal' test collection. A Large Language Model
(LLM) is used to create query variants: alternative queries that have the same
meaning as the original. These variants represent user profiles characterised
by different properties, such as language and domain proficiency, which are
known in the IR literature to influence query formulation.
  The LLM's ability to generate query variants that align with user profiles is
empirically validated, and the variants' utility is further explored for IR
system evaluation. Results demonstrate that the variants impact how systems are
ranked and show that user profiles experience significantly different levels of
system effectiveness. This method enables an alternative perspective on system
evaluation where we can observe both the impact of user profiles on system
rankings and how system performance varies across users.

Conclusion: 基于词检索模型并无固有的源偏，而是依据与查询的词分布匹配程度，本文为理解和应对混合源内容的检索偏差提供了基础。

Abstract: As more content generated by large language models (LLMs) floods into the
Internet, information retrieval (IR) systems now face the challenge of
distinguishing and handling a blend of human-authored and machine-generated
texts. Recent studies suggest that neural retrievers may exhibit a preferential
inclination toward LLM-generated content, while classic term-based retrievers
like BM25 tend to favor human-written documents. This paper investigates the
influence of LLM-generated content on term-based retrieval models, which are
valued for their efficiency and robust generalization across domains. Our
linguistic analysis reveals that LLM-generated texts exhibit smoother
high-frequency and steeper low-frequency Zipf slopes, higher term specificity,
and greater document-level diversity. These traits are aligned with LLMs being
trained to optimize reader experience through diverse and precise expressions.
Our study further explores whether term-based retrieval models demonstrate
source bias, concluding that these models prioritize documents whose term
distributions closely correspond to those of the queries, rather than
displaying an inherent source bias. This work provides a foundation for
understanding and addressing potential biases in term-based IR systems managing
mixed-source content.

Result: 在离线和在线实验中，DiffusionGS表现优于现有最先进方法，验证其有效性。

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型的兴趣提取方法能更动态地捕捉用户兴趣变化，提升搜索排序性能。

Abstract: Personalized search ranking systems are critical for driving engagement and
revenue in modern e-commerce and short-video platforms. While existing methods
excel at estimating users' broad interests based on the filtered historical
behaviors, they typically under-exploit explicit alignment between a user's
real-time intent (represented by the user query) and their past actions. In
this paper, we propose DiffusionGS, a novel and scalable approach powered by
generative models. Our key insight is that user queries can serve as explicit
intent anchors to facilitate the extraction of users' immediate interests from
long-term, noisy historical behaviors. Specifically, we formulate interest
extraction as a conditional denoising task, where the user's query guides a
conditional diffusion process to produce a robust, user intent-aware
representation from their behavioral sequence. We propose the User-aware
Denoising Layer (UDL) to incorporate user-specific profiles into the
optimization of attention distribution on the user's past actions. By reframing
queries as intent priors and leveraging diffusion-based denoising, our method
provides a powerful mechanism for capturing dynamic user interest shifts.
Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate the superiority of
DiffusionGS over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LexSemBridge是一种便捷的插件框架，能增强模型细粒度检索能力，适用于文本和视觉多模态任务。

Abstract: As queries in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines powered by large
language models (LLMs) become increasingly complex and diverse, dense retrieval
models have demonstrated strong performance in semantic matching. Nevertheless,
they often struggle with fine-grained retrieval tasks, where precise keyword
alignment and span-level localization are required, even in cases with high
lexical overlap that would intuitively suggest easier retrieval. To
systematically evaluate this limitation, we introduce two targeted tasks,
keyword retrieval and part-of-passage retrieval, designed to simulate practical
fine-grained scenarios. Motivated by these observations, we propose
LexSemBridge, a unified framework that enhances dense query representations
through fine-grained, input-aware vector modulation. LexSemBridge constructs
latent enhancement vectors from input tokens using three paradigms: Statistical
(SLR), Learned (LLR), and Contextual (CLR), and integrates them with dense
embeddings via element-wise interaction. Theoretically, we show that this
modulation preserves the semantic direction while selectively amplifying
discriminative dimensions. LexSemBridge operates as a plug-in without modifying
the backbone encoder and naturally extends to both text and vision modalities.
Extensive experiments across semantic and fine-grained retrieval tasks validate
the effectiveness and generality of our approach. All code and models are
publicly available at https://github.com/Jasaxion/LexSemBridge/

Result: 在三个公开问答基准测试中，RFM-RAG优于传统方法，显著提升系统准确率。

Conclusion: 通过转变为有状态的知识管理体系，增强模型的知识覆盖和检索效率，有助于改善复杂任务中的知识缺口问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, yet they face inherent limitations such as constrained
parametric knowledge and high retraining costs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) augments the generation process by retrieving externally stored knowledge
absent from the models internal parameters. However, RAG methods face
challenges such as information loss and redundant retrievals during multi-round
queries, accompanying the difficulties in precisely characterizing knowledge
gaps for complex tasks. To address these problems, we propose Retrieval
Feedback and Memory Retrieval Augmented Generation(RFM-RAG), which transforms
the stateless retrieval of previous methods into stateful continuous knowledge
management by constructing a dynamic evidence pool. Specifically, our method
generates refined queries describing the models knowledge gaps using relational
triples from questions and evidence from the dynamic evidence pool; Retrieves
critical external knowledge to iteratively update this evidence pool; Employs a
R-Feedback Model to evaluate evidence completeness until convergence. Compared
to traditional RAG methods, our approach enables persistent storage of
retrieved passages and effectively distills key information from passages to
construct clearly new queries. Experiments on three public QA benchmarks
demonstrate that RFM-RAG outperforms previous methods and improves overall
system accuracy.

Conclusion: HyST是一种可扩展且准确的半结构化数据检索方案，有助于提升用户查询的匹配效率和效果。

Abstract: User queries in real-world recommendation systems often combine structured

Semi-structured Tabular data), a hybrid retrieval framework that combines
LLM-powered structured filtering with semantic embedding search to support
complex information needs over semi-structured tabular data. HyST extracts
attribute-level constraints from natural language using large language models

unstructured query components via embedding-based retrieval. Experiments on a
semi-structured benchmark show that HyST consistently outperforms tradtional
baselines, highlighting the importance of structured filtering in improving
retrieval precision, offering a scalable and accurate solution for real-world

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AIGC系统缺乏个性化内容生成能力，存在模型训练难度大和效率低的问题，亟需改进以满足工业化应用需求。

Method: 采用Hierarchical LLM框架，结合用户分群、广告匹配预测和链式推理的数据构建策略，提升个性化内容的生成效果与效率。

Conclusion: HLLM-Creator在实现高效、个性化的内容生成方面具有巨大潜力，有助于推动工业场景中的个性化生成技术发展。

Abstract: AI-generated content technologies are widely used in content creation.
However, current AIGC systems rely heavily on creators' inspiration, rarely
generating truly user-personalized content. In real-world applications such as
online advertising, a single product may have multiple selling points, with
different users focusing on different features. This underscores the
significant value of personalized, user-centric creative generation. Effective
personalized content generation faces two main challenges: (1) accurately
modeling user interests and integrating them into the content generation
process while adhering to factual constraints, and (2) ensuring high efficiency
and scalability to handle the massive user base in industrial scenarios.
Additionally, the scarcity of personalized creative data in practice
complicates model training, making data construction another key hurdle. We
propose HLLM-Creator, a hierarchical LLM framework for efficient user interest
modeling and personalized content generation. During inference, a combination
of user clustering and a user-ad-matching-prediction based pruning strategy is
employed to significantly enhance generation efficiency and reduce
computational overhead, making the approach suitable for large-scale
deployment. Moreover, we design a data construction pipeline based on
chain-of-thought reasoning, which generates high-quality, user-specific
creative titles and ensures factual consistency despite limited personalized
data. This pipeline serves as a critical foundation for the effectiveness of
our model. Extensive experiments on personalized title generation for Douyin
Search Ads show the effectiveness of HLLM-Creator. Online A/B test shows a
0.476% increase on Adss, paving the way for more effective and efficient
personalized generation in industrial scenarios. Codes for academic dataset are

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升多轮对话场景下的商品检索准确性，为未来多模态检索提供新思路。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of e-commerce has exposed the limitations of traditional
product retrieval systems in managing complex, multi-turn user interactions.
Recent advances in multimodal generative retrieval -- particularly those
leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as retrievers -- have shown
promise. However, most existing methods are tailored to single-turn scenarios
and struggle to model the evolving intent and iterative nature of multi-turn
dialogues when applied naively. Concurrently, test-time scaling has emerged as
a powerful paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) performance
through iterative inference-time refinement. Yet, its effectiveness typically
relies on two conditions: (1) a well-defined problem space (e.g., mathematical
reasoning), and (2) the model's ability to self-correct -- conditions that are
rarely met in conversational product search. In this setting, user queries are
often ambiguous and evolving, and MLLMs alone have difficulty grounding
responses in a fixed product corpus. Motivated by these challenges, we propose
a novel framework that introduces test-time scaling into conversational
multimodal product retrieval. Our approach builds on a generative retriever,
further augmented with a test-time reranking (TTR) mechanism that improves
retrieval accuracy and better aligns results with evolving user intent
throughout the dialogue. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent
improvements, with average gains of 14.5 points in MRR and 10.6 points in
nDCG@1.

Conclusion: PCR-CA通过多模态表示、多字典量化和对比学习，有效应对多类别、多语义的推荐挑战，提升了推荐系统的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Modern app store recommender systems struggle with multiple-category apps, as
traditional taxonomies fail to capture overlapping semantics, leading to
suboptimal personalization. We propose PCR-CA (Parallel Codebook
Representations with Contrastive Alignment), an end-to-end framework for
improved CTR prediction. PCR-CA first extracts compact multimodal embeddings
from app text, then introduces a Parallel Codebook VQ-AE module that learns
discrete semantic representations across multiple codebooks in parallel --
unlike hierarchical residual quantization (RQ-VAE). This design enables
independent encoding of diverse aspects (e.g., gameplay, art style), better
modeling multiple-category semantics. To bridge semantic and collaborative
signals, we employ a contrastive alignment loss at both the user and item
levels, enhancing representation learning for long-tail items. Additionally, a
dual-attention fusion mechanism combines ID-based and semantic features to
capture user interests, especially for long-tail apps. Experiments on a
large-scale dataset show PCR-CA achieves a +0.76% AUC improvement over strong
baselines, with +2.15% AUC gains for long-tail apps. Online A/B testing further
validates our approach, showing a +10.52% lift in CTR and a +16.30% improvement
in CVR, demonstrating PCR-CA's effectiveness in real-world deployment. The new
framework has now been fully deployed on the Microsoft Store.

Conclusion: 该方法具有广阔应用前景，可提升制造效率，为未来COP优化提供方向。

Abstract: Cut order planning (COP) is a critical challenge in the textile industry,
directly impacting fabric utilization and production costs. Conventional
methods based on static heuristics and catalog-based estimations often struggle
to adapt to dynamic production environments, resulting in suboptimal solutions
and increased waste. In response, we propose a novel Quantum-Inspired Deep
Reinforcement Learning (QI-DRL) framework that integrates Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) networks with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise. This hybrid approach is
designed to explicitly address key research questions regarding the benefits of
quantum-inspired probabilistic representations, the role of LSTM-based memory
in capturing sequential dependencies, and the effectiveness of OU noise in
facilitating smooth exploration and faster convergence. Extensive training over
1000 episodes demonstrates robust performance, with an average reward of 0.81
(-+0.03) and a steady decrease in prediction loss to 0.15 (-+0.02). A
comparative analysis reveals that the proposed approach achieves fabric cost
savings of up to 13% compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, statistical
evaluations indicate low variability and stable convergence. Despite the fact
that the simulation model makes several simplifying assumptions, these
promising results underscore the potential of the scalable and adaptive
framework to enhance manufacturing efficiency and pave the way for future
innovations in COP optimization.

Abstract: We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure
generation that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend
of architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs,
CrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive
bias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent
system. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a
balanced training strategy, our approach achieves 9.62% SUN (Stable, Unique,
Novel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including
FlowMM (4.38%) and MatterGen (3.42%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28%
unique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates,
demonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than
complexity for materials discovery. Our results suggest that in data-limited
scientific domains, carefully designed simple architectures outperform
sophisticated alternatives that are prone to overfitting.

Conclusion: 提出的两个方法为数据流异常检测提供新的思路，特别是DyCG无需调参，具有实际应用潜力，未来可在多维及大规模场景中推广。

Abstract: Outlier detection holds significant importance in the realm of data mining,
particularly with the growing pervasiveness of data acquisition methods. The
ability to identify outliers in data streams is essential for maintaining data
quality and detecting faults. However, dealing with data streams presents
challenges due to the non-stationary nature of distributions and the
ever-increasing data volume. While numerous methods have been proposed to
tackle this challenge, a common drawback is the lack of straightforward
parameterization in many of them. This article introduces two novel methods:
DyCF and DyCG. DyCF leverages the Christoffel function from the theory of
approximation and orthogonal polynomials. Conversely, DyCG capitalizes on the
growth properties of the Christoffel function, eliminating the need for tuning
parameters. Both approaches are firmly rooted in a well-defined algebraic
framework, meeting crucial demands for data stream processing, with a specific
focus on addressing low-dimensional aspects and maintaining data history
without memory cost. A comprehensive comparison between DyCF, DyCG, and
state-of-the-art methods is presented, using both synthetic and real industrial
data streams. The results show that DyCF outperforms fine-tuning methods,
offering superior performance in terms of execution time and memory usage. DyCG
performs less well, but has the considerable advantage of requiring no tuning
at all.

Abstract: Next location prediction is a critical task in human mobility modeling,
enabling applications like travel planning and urban mobility management.
Existing methods mainly rely on historical spatiotemporal trajectory data to
train sequence models that directly forecast future locations. However, they
often overlook the importance of the future spatiotemporal contexts, which are
highly informative for the future locations. For example, knowing how much time
and distance a user will travel could serve as a critical clue for predicting
the user's next location. Against this background, we propose \textbf{STRelay},
a universal \textbf{\underline{S}}patio\textbf{\underline{T}}emporal
\textbf{\underline{Relay}}ing framework explicitly modeling the future
spatiotemporal context given a human trajectory, to boost the performance of
different location prediction models. Specifically, STRelay models future
spatiotemporal contexts in a relaying manner, which is subsequently integrated
with the encoded historical representation from a base location prediction
model, enabling multi-task learning by simultaneously predicting the next time
interval, next moving distance interval, and finally the next location. We
evaluate STRelay integrated with four state-of-the-art location prediction base
models on four real-world trajectory datasets. Results demonstrate that STRelay
consistently improves prediction performance across all cases by
3.19\%-11.56\%. Additionally, we find that the future spatiotemporal contexts
are particularly helpful for entertainment-related locations and also for user
groups who prefer traveling longer distances. The performance gain on such
non-daily-routine activities, which often suffer from higher uncertainty, is
indeed complementary to the base location prediction models that often excel at
modeling regular daily routine patterns.

Abstract: Traffic prediction is a cornerstone of modern intelligent transportation
systems and a critical task in spatio-temporal forecasting. Although advanced
Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have
achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain:
(i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal
dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal
points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates
retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these
challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder
and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and
construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval
Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns;
and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained
STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world
traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST
achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have been extensively applied across various domains, where
memory stands out as one of their most essential capabilities. Previous memory
mechanisms of LLM-based agents are manually predefined by human experts,
leading to higher labor costs and suboptimal performance. In addition, these
methods overlook the memory cycle effect in interactive scenarios, which is
critical to optimizing LLM-based agents for specific environments. To address
these challenges, in this paper, we propose to optimize LLM-based agents with
an adaptive and data-driven memory framework by modeling memory cycles.
Specifically, we design an MoE gate function to facilitate memory retrieval,
propose a learnable aggregation process to improve memory utilization, and
develop task-specific reflection to adapt memory storage. Our memory framework
empowers LLM-based agents to learn how to memorize information effectively in
specific environments, with both off-policy and on-policy optimization. In
order to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we conduct
comprehensive experiments across multiple aspects. To benefit the research
community in this area, we release our project at

Motivation: 研究旨在解决地下含水层模拟中的高复杂性与高计算成本问题，尤其是在断层对流体流动影响显著的情况下，提供快速、准确的预测工具。

Method: 开发了结合重复Transformer与U-Net的代理模型，通过模拟4000个随机样本训练，进行了模型性能验证和误差评估，并应用于全局敏感性分析和数据同化，采用层级马尔可夫链蒙特卡罗方法。

Conclusion: 该模型提供快速高效的工具，用于含断层地下水系统的预测与不确定性管理，能有效优化监测策略，提高CO2存储的安全性与效率。

Abstract: Many subsurface formations, including some of those under consideration for
large-scale geological carbon storage, include extensive faults that can
strongly impact fluid flow. In this study, we develop a new recurrent
transformer U-Net surrogate model to provide very fast predictions for pressure
and CO2 saturation in realistic faulted subsurface aquifer systems. The
geomodel includes a target aquifer (into which supercritical CO2 is injected),
surrounding regions, caprock, two extensive faults, and two overlying aquifers.
The faults can act as leakage pathways between the three aquifers. The
heterogeneous property fields in the target aquifer are characterized by
hierarchical uncertainty, meaning both the geological metaparameters (e.g.,
mean and standard deviation of log-permeability) and the detailed cell
properties of each realization, are uncertain. Fault permeabilities are also
treated as uncertain. The model is trained with simulation results for (up to)
4000 randomly sampled realizations. Error assessments show that this model is
more accurate than a previous recurrent residual U-Net, and that it maintains
accuracy for qualitatively different leakage scenarios. The new surrogate is
then used for global sensitivity analysis and data assimilation. A hierarchical
Markov chain Monte Carlo data assimilation procedure is applied. Different
monitoring strategies, corresponding to different amounts and types of observed
data collected at monitoring wells, are considered for three synthetic true
models. Detailed results demonstrate the degree of uncertainty reduction
achieved with the various monitoring strategies. Posterior results for 3D
saturation plumes and leakage volumes indicate the benefits of measuring
pressure and saturation in all three aquifers.

degradation over time, effectively addressing the fundamental challenge of
catastrophic forgetting in neural networks

Conclusion: UEM框架有效增强了图信号处理的表达能力和适应性，特别是在复杂和变化的网络结构中，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Graph signal processing has become an essential tool for analyzing data
structured on irregular domains. While conventional graph shift operators
(GSOs) are effective for certain tasks, they inherently lack flexibility in
modeling dependencies between non-adjacent nodes, limiting their ability to
represent complex graph structures. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes the unified extended matrix (UEM) framework, which integrates the
extended-adjacency matrix and the unified graph representation matrix through
parametric design, so as to be able to flexibly adapt to different graph
structures and reveal more graph signal information. Theoretical analysis of
the UEM is conducted, demonstrating positive semi-definiteness and eigenvalue
monotonicity under specific conditions. Then, we propose graph Fourier
transform based on UEM (UEM-GFT), which can adaptively tune spectral properties
to enhance signal processing performance. Experimental results on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the UEM-GFT outperforms existing GSO-based
methods in anomaly detection tasks, achieving superior performance across
varying network topologies.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Fault Diagnosis (FSC-FD), which aims to
continuously learn from new fault classes with only a few samples without
forgetting old ones, is critical for real-world industrial systems. However,
this challenging task severely amplifies the issues of catastrophic forgetting
of old knowledge and overfitting on scarce new data. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework built upon Dual-Granularity
Representations, termed the Dual-Granularity Guidance Network (DGGN). Our DGGN
explicitly decouples feature learning into two parallel streams: 1) a
fine-grained representation stream, which utilizes a novel Multi-Order
Interaction Aggregation module to capture discriminative, class-specific
features from the limited new samples. 2) a coarse-grained representation
stream, designed to model and preserve general, class-agnostic knowledge shared
across all fault types. These two representations are dynamically fused by a
multi-semantic cross-attention mechanism, where the stable coarse-grained
knowledge guides the learning of fine-grained features, preventing overfitting
and alleviating feature conflicts. To further mitigate catastrophic forgetting,
we design a Boundary-Aware Exemplar Prioritization strategy. Moreover, a
decoupled Balanced Random Forest classifier is employed to counter the decision
boundary bias caused by data imbalance. Extensive experiments on the TEP
benchmark and a real-world MFF dataset demonstrate that our proposed DGGN
achieves superior diagnostic performance and stability compared to
state-of-the-art FSC-FD approaches. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 融合统计推理与现代基础模型能有效提升时间序列预测的准确性、可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) such as Lag-Llama, TimeGPT, Chronos,
MOMENT, UniTS, and TimesFM have shown strong generalization and zero-shot
capabilities for time series forecasting, anomaly detection, classification,
and imputation. Despite these advantages, their predictions still suffer from
variance, domain-specific bias, and limited uncertainty quantification when
deployed on real operational data. This paper investigates a suite of
statistical and ensemble-based enhancement techniques, including
bootstrap-based bagging, regression-based stacking, prediction interval
construction, statistical residual modeling, and iterative error feedback, to
improve robustness and accuracy. Using the Belgium Electricity Short-Term Load
Forecasting dataset as a case study, we demonstrate that the proposed hybrids
consistently outperform standalone foundation models across multiple horizons.
Regression-based ensembles achieve the lowest mean squared error; bootstrap
aggregation markedly reduces long-context errors; residual modeling corrects
systematic bias; and the resulting prediction intervals achieve near nominal
coverage with widths shrinking as context length increases. The results
indicate that integrating statistical reasoning with modern foundation models
yields measurable gains in accuracy, reliability, and interpretability for
real-world time series applications.

Abstract: From large language models to multi-modal agents, Generative Artificial
Intelligence (AI) now underpins state-of-the-art systems. Despite their varied
architectures, many share a common foundation in probabilistic latent variable
models (PLVMs), where hidden variables explain observed data for density
estimation, latent reasoning, and structured inference. This paper presents a
unified perspective by framing both classical and modern generative methods
within the PLVM paradigm. We trace the progression from classical flat models
such as probabilistic PCA, Gaussian mixture models, latent class analysis, item
response theory, and latent Dirichlet allocation, through their sequential
extensions including Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian HMMs, and Linear Dynamical
Systems, to contemporary deep architectures: Variational Autoencoders as Deep
PLVMs, Normalizing Flows as Tractable PLVMs, Diffusion Models as Sequential
PLVMs, Autoregressive Models as Explicit Generative Models, and Generative
Adversarial Networks as Implicit PLVMs. Viewing these architectures under a
common probabilistic taxonomy reveals shared principles, distinct inference
strategies, and the representational trade-offs that shape their strengths. We
offer a conceptual roadmap that consolidates generative AI's theoretical
foundations, clarifies methodological lineages, and guides future innovation by
grounding emerging architectures in their probabilistic heritage.

Conclusion: AdapSNE通过结合优化搜索算法与硬件加速，为边缘设备上的无DNN数据采样和训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) directly on edge devices has attracted
increasing attention, as it offers promising solutions to challenges such as
domain adaptation and privacy preservation. However, conventional DNN training
typically requires large-scale datasets, which imposes prohibitive overhead on
edge devices-particularly for emerging large language model (LLM) tasks. To
address this challenge, a DNN-free method (ie., dataset sampling without DNN),
named NMS (Near-Memory Sampling), has been introduced. By first conducting
dimensionality reduction of the dataset and then performing exemplar sampling
in the reduced space, NMS avoids the architectural bias inherent in DNN-based
methods and thus achieves better generalization. However, The state-of-the-art,
NMS, suffers from two limitations: (1) The mismatch between the search method
and the non-monotonic property of the perplexity error function leads to the
emergence of outliers in the reduced representation; (2) Key parameter (ie.,
target perplexity) is selected empirically, introducing arbitrariness and
leading to uneven sampling. These two issues lead to representative bias of
examplars, resulting in degraded accuracy. To address these issues, we propose
AdapSNE, which integrates an efficient non-monotonic search method-namely, the
Fireworks Algorithm (FWA)-to suppress outliers, and employs entropy-guided
optimization to enforce uniform sampling, thereby ensuring representative
training samples and consequently boosting training accuracy. To cut the
edge-side cost arising from the iterative computations of FWA search and
entropy-guided optimization, we design an accelerator with custom dataflow and
time-multiplexing markedly reducing on-device training energy and area.

Conclusion: LatentFlow为湍流尾流场高频重建提供了新途径，具有推广潜力，可在实验数据有限情况下应用。

Abstract: Acquiring temporally high-frequency and spatially high-resolution turbulent
wake flow fields in particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments remains a
significant challenge due to hardware limitations and measurement noise. In
contrast, temporal high-frequency measurements of spatially sparse wall
pressure are more readily accessible in wind tunnel experiments. In this study,
we propose a novel cross-modal temporal upscaling framework, LatentFlow, which
reconstructs high-frequency (512 Hz) turbulent wake flow fields by fusing
synchronized low-frequency (15 Hz) flow field and pressure data during
training, and high-frequency wall pressure signals during inference. The first
stage involves training a pressure-conditioned $\beta$-variation autoencoder
($p$C-$\beta$-VAE) to learn a compact latent representation that captures the
intrinsic dynamics of the wake flow. A secondary network maps synchronized
low-frequency wall pressure signals into the latent space, enabling
reconstruction of the wake flow field solely from sparse wall pressure. Once
trained, the model utilizes high-frequency, spatially sparse wall pressure
inputs to generate corresponding high-frequency flow fields via the
$p$C-$\beta$-VAE decoder. By decoupling the spatial encoding of flow dynamics
from temporal pressure measurements, LatentFlow provides a scalable and robust
solution for reconstructing high-frequency turbulent wake flows in
data-constrained experimental settings.

Abstract: We propose HiCL, a novel hippocampal-inspired dual-memory continual learning
architecture designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by using elements
inspired by the hippocampal circuitry. Our system encodes inputs through a
grid-cell-like layer, followed by sparse pattern separation using a dentate
gyrus-inspired module with top-k sparsity. Episodic memory traces are
maintained in a CA3-like autoassociative memory. Task-specific processing is
dynamically managed via a DG-gated mixture-of-experts mechanism, wherein inputs
are routed to experts based on cosine similarity between their normalized
sparse DG representations and learned task-specific DG prototypes computed
through online exponential moving averages. This biologically grounded yet
mathematically principled gating strategy enables differentiable, scalable
task-routing without relying on a separate gating network, and enhances the
model's adaptability and efficiency in learning multiple sequential tasks.
Cortical outputs are consolidated using Elastic Weight Consolidation weighted
by inter-task similarity. Crucially, we incorporate prioritized replay of
stored patterns to reinforce essential past experiences. Evaluations on
standard continual learning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
architecture in reducing task interference, achieving near state-of-the-art
results in continual learning tasks at lower computational costs.

Abstract: With the advent of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices, remote patient
monitoring (RPM) emerged as a promising solution for managing heart failure.
However, the heart rate can fluctuate significantly due to various factors, and
without correlating it to the patient's actual physical activity, it becomes
difficult to assess whether changes are significant. Although Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models may enhance the accuracy and contextual understanding
of remote heart rate monitoring, the integration of activity data is still
rarely addressed. In this paper, we propose a Transformer model combined with a
Laplace diffusion technique to model heart rate fluctuations driven by physical
activity of the patient. Unlike prior models that treat activity as secondary,
our approach conditions the entire modeling process on activity context using
specialized embeddings and attention mechanisms to prioritize activity specific
historical patents. The model captures both long-term patterns and
activity-specific heart rate dynamics by incorporating contextualized
embeddings and dedicated encoder. The Transformer model was validated on a
real-world dataset collected from 29 patients over a 4-month period.
Experimental results show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods, achieving a 43% reduction in mean absolute error compared to the
considered baseline models. Moreover, the coefficient of determination R2 is
0.97 indicating the model predicted heart rate is in strong agreement with
actual heart rate values. These findings suggest that the proposed model is a
practical and effective tool for supporting both healthcare providers and
remote patient monitoring systems.

Abstract: The expansion of machine learning into dynamic environments presents
challenges in handling open-world problems where label shift, covariate shift,
and unknown classes emerge. Post-training methods have been explored to address
these challenges, adapting models to newly emerging data. However, these
methods struggle when the initial pre-training is performed on class-imbalanced
datasets, limiting generalization to minority classes. To address this, we
propose a method that effectively handles open-world problems even when
pre-training is conducted on imbalanced data. Our contrastive-based
pre-training approach enhances classification performance, particularly for
underrepresented classes. Our post-training mechanism generates reliable
pseudo-labels, improving model robustness against open-world problems. We also
introduce selective activation criteria to optimize the post-training process,
reducing unnecessary computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art adaptation techniques in both
accuracy and efficiency across diverse open-world scenarios.

Abstract: Transformer architecture gradually dominates the LLM field. Recent advances
in training optimization for Transformer-based large language models (LLMs)
primarily focus on architectural modifications or optimizer adjustments.
However, these approaches lack systematic optimization of weight patterns
during training. Weight pattern refers to the distribution and relative
magnitudes of weight parameters in a neural network. To address this issue, we
propose a Weight Scaling method called WISCA to enhance training efficiency and
model quality by strategically improving neural network weight patterns without
changing network structures. By rescaling weights while preserving model
outputs, WISCA indirectly optimizes the model's training trajectory.
Experiments demonstrate that WISCA significantly improves convergence quality
(measured by generalization capability and loss reduction), particularly in
LLMs with Grouped Query Attention (GQA) architectures and LoRA fine-tuning
tasks. Empirical results show 5.6% average improvement on zero-shot validation
tasks and 2.12% average reduction in training perplexity across multiple
architectures.

Abstract: Many existing studies have achieved significant improvements in the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR), while the enhancement of reasoning abilities in
small language models (SLMs) has not yet been sufficiently explored. Combining
distilled data from larger models with RLVR on small models themselves is a
natural approach, but it still faces various challenges and issues. Therefore,
we propose \textit{\underline{R}}ecall-\textit{\underline{E}}xtend
\textit{\underline{D}}ynamics(RED): Enhancing Small Language Models through
Controlled Exploration and Refined Offline Integration. In this paper, we
explore the perspective of varying exploration spaces, balancing offline
distillation with online reinforcement learning. Simultaneously, we
specifically design and optimize for the insertion problem within offline data.
By monitoring the ratio of entropy changes in the model concerning offline and
online data, we regulate the weight of offline-SFT, thereby addressing the
issues of insufficient exploration space in small models and the redundancy and
complexity during the distillation process. Furthermore, to tackle the
distribution discrepancies between offline data and the current policy, we
design a sample-accuracy-based policy shift mechanism that dynamically chooses
between imitating offline distilled data and learning from its own policy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的低秩分解压缩方法CALR，有效补偿SVD压缩带来的性能损失，显著减少模型参数的同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在资源有限环境下的部署难题，尤其是压缩过程中性能损失的问题。

Method: 结合SVD压缩和可学习的低秩修正模块，通过训练补偿压缩带来的功能信息丢失，提升模型性能。

Result: 在多个大型模型上实现了显著的参数减半，同时保持接近原始性能，优于现有压缩方法。

Conclusion: CALR作为一种将功能信息损失作为学习信号的方法，有效推动了小型高效LLMs的构建和应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their immense size and computational requirements. Model compression techniques
are essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained
environments. A prominent compression strategy is low-rank factorization via
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce model parameters by approximating
weight matrices. However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix
reconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's
functional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing
methods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during
compression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank
Decomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach. CALR combines a
primary path of SVD-compressed layers with a parallel, learnable, low-rank
corrective module that is explicitly trained to recover the functional residual
error. Our experimental evaluation on SmolLM2-135M, Qwen3-0.6B, and
Llama-3.2-1B, demonstrates that CALR can reduce parameter counts by 26.93% to
51.77% while retaining 59.45% to 90.42% of the original model's performance,
consistently outperforming LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse. CALR's success shows
that treating functional information loss as a learnable signal is a highly
effective compression paradigm. This approach enables the creation of
significantly smaller, more efficient LLMs, advancing their accessibility and
practical deployment in real-world applications.

Conclusion: STGAtt模型有效整合空间和时间信息，有助于智能交通系统的应用推广，具有很强的实际潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and timely traffic flow forecasting is crucial for intelligent
transportation systems. This paper presents a novel deep learning model, the
Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network (STGAtt). By leveraging a
unified graph representation and an attention mechanism, STGAtt effectively
captures complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Unlike methods relying on
separate spatial and temporal dependency modeling modules, STGAtt directly
models correlations within a Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph, dynamically
weighing connections across both dimensions. To further enhance its
capabilities, STGAtt partitions traffic flow observation signal into
neighborhood subsets and employs a novel exchanging mechanism, enabling
effective capture of both short-range and long-range correlations. Extensive
experiments on the PEMS-BAY and SHMetro datasets demonstrate STGAtt's superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various prediction
horizons. Visualization of attention weights confirms STGAtt's ability to adapt
to dynamic traffic patterns and capture long-range dependencies, highlighting
its potential for real-world traffic flow forecasting applications.

Conclusion: 该框架适用于复杂分布的预测，并可推广至科学模型中的不确定性量化，促进科学预测的可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate quantification of uncertainty in neural network predictions remains
a central challenge for scientific applications involving high-dimensional,
correlated data. While existing methods capture either aleatoric or epistemic
uncertainty, few offer closed-form, multidimensional distributions that
preserve spatial correlation while remaining computationally tractable. In this
work, we present a framework for training neural networks with a
multidimensional Gaussian loss, generating closed-form predictive distributions
over outputs with non-identically distributed and heteroscedastic structure.
Our approach captures aleatoric uncertainty by iteratively estimating the means
and covariance matrices, and is demonstrated on a super-resolution example. We
leverage a Fourier representation of the covariance matrix to stabilize network
training and preserve spatial correlation. We introduce a novel regularization
strategy -- referred to as information sharing -- that interpolates between
image-specific and global covariance estimates, enabling convergence of the
super-resolution downscaling network trained on image-specific distributional
loss functions. This framework allows for efficient sampling, explicit
correlation modeling, and extensions to more complex distribution families all
without disrupting prediction performance. We demonstrate the method on a
surface wind speed downscaling task and discuss its broader applicability to
uncertainty-aware prediction in scientific models.

Conclusion: 子空间嵌入提供了更丰富的语义建模和推理框架，优于传统点嵌入。

Abstract: Traditional neural embeddings represent concepts as points, excelling at
similarity but struggling with higher-level reasoning and asymmetric
relationships. We introduce a novel paradigm: embedding concepts as linear
subspaces. This framework inherently models generality via subspace
dimensionality and hierarchy through subspace inclusion. It naturally supports
set-theoretic operations like intersection (conjunction), linear sum
(disjunction) and orthogonal complements (negations), aligning with classical
formal semantics. To enable differentiable learning, we propose a smooth
relaxation of orthogonal projection operators, allowing for the learning of
both subspace orientation and dimension. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
results in reconstruction and link prediction on WordNet. Furthermore, on
natural language inference benchmarks, our subspace embeddings surpass
bi-encoder baselines, offering an interpretable formulation of entailment that
is both geometrically grounded and amenable to logical operations.

Conclusion: 大规模预训练为LLM检索效果提供了明确提升路径，影响其未来开发策略。

Abstract: How does retrieval performance scale with pretraining FLOPs? We benchmark
retrieval performance across LLM model sizes from 125 million parameters to 7
billion parameters pretrained on datasets ranging from 1 billion tokens to more
than 2 trillion tokens. We find that retrieval performance on zero-shot BEIR
tasks predictably scales with LLM size, training duration, and estimated FLOPs.
We also show that In-Context Learning scores are strongly correlated with
retrieval scores across retrieval tasks. Finally, we highlight the implications
this has for the development of LLM-based retrievers.

Abstract: In this study, we firstly propose an auxiliary equation neural networks
method (AENNM), an innovative analytical method that integrates neural networks
(NNs) models with the auxiliary equation method to obtain exact solutions of
nonlinear partial differential equations (NLPDEs). A key novelty of this method
is the introduction of a novel activation function derived from the solutions
of the Riccati equation, establishing a new mathematical link between
differential equations theory and deep learning. By combining the strong
approximation capability of NNs with the high precision of symbolic
computation, AENNM significantly enhances computational efficiency and
accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the AENNM in solving NLPDEs,
three numerical examples are investigated, including the nonlinear evolution
equation, the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation, and the (2+1)-dimensional
Boussinesq equation. Furthermore, some new trial functions are constructed by
setting specific activation functions within the "2-2-2-1" and "3-2-2-1" NNs
models. By embedding the auxiliary equation method into the NNs framework, we
derive previously unreported solutions. The exact analytical solutions are
expressed in terms of hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions, and
rational functions. Finally, three-dimensional plots, contour plots, and
density plots are presented to illustrate the dynamic characteristics of the
obtained solutions. This research provides a novel methodological framework for
addressing NLPDEs, with broad applicability across scientific and engineering
fields.

Result: 在多种深度学习任务中，ALSO优于传统优化器和现有DRO方法，表现优异。

Conclusion: ALSO成功实现了兼具鲁棒性和实践适应性的优化方案，有望推动深度学习优化技术的发展。

Abstract: While traditional Deep Learning (DL) optimization methods treat all training
samples equally, Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) adaptively assigns
importance weights to different samples. However, a significant gap exists
between DRO and current DL practices. Modern DL optimizers require adaptivity
and the ability to handle stochastic gradients, as these methods demonstrate
superior performance. Additionally, for practical applications, a method should
allow weight assignment not only to individual samples, but also to groups of
objects (for example, all samples of the same class). This paper aims to bridge
this gap by introducing ALSO $\unicode{x2013}$ Adaptive Loss Scaling Optimizer
$\unicode{x2013}$ an adaptive algorithm for a modified DRO objective that can
handle weight assignment to sample groups. We prove the convergence of our
proposed algorithm for non-convex objectives, which is the typical case for DL
models. Empirical evaluation across diverse Deep Learning tasks, from Tabular
DL to Split Learning tasks, demonstrates that ALSO outperforms both traditional
optimizers and existing DRO methods.

Result: 该方法在排队论及其他领域的若干实例中证明了其有效性，即使在非紧集状态空间内亦表现良好。

Conclusion: 深度学习为Lyapunov函数的自动构建提供了一种可行且有效的工具，拓展了其在更广泛Markov模型中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Lyapunov functions are fundamental to establishing the stability of Markovian
models, yet their construction typically demands substantial creativity and
analytical effort. In this paper, we show that deep learning can automate this
process by training neural networks to satisfy integral equations derived from
first-transition analysis. Beyond stability analysis, our approach can be
adapted to solve Poisson's equation and estimate stationary distributions.
While neural networks are inherently function approximators on compact domains,
it turns out that our approach remains effective when applied to Markov chains
on non-compact state spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
methodology through several examples from queueing theory and beyond.

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合互信息和色彩编码，为异质数据的可视化分析提供了新工具，适应多领域复杂关系的分析需求。

Abstract: This paper proposes an embedding method for co-occurrence data aimed at
visual information exploration. We consider cases where co-occurrence
probabilities are measured between pairs of elements from heterogeneous
domains. The proposed method maps these heterogeneous elements into
corresponding two-dimensional latent spaces, enabling visualization of
asymmetric relationships between the domains. The key idea is to embed the
elements in a way that maximizes their mutual information, thereby preserving
the original dependency structure as much as possible. This approach can be
naturally extended to cases involving three or more domains, using a
generalization of mutual information known as total correlation. For
inter-domain analysis, we also propose a visualization method that assigns
colors to the latent spaces based on conditional probabilities, allowing users
to explore asymmetric relationships interactively. We demonstrate the utility
of the method through applications to an adjective-noun dataset, the NeurIPS
dataset, and a subject-verb-object dataset, showcasing both intra- and
inter-domain analysis.

Conclusion: 弱教师模型可可靠引导大模型，开启高效、安全的提示工程新路径。

Abstract: Effective prompt engineering remains a challenging task for many
applications. We introduce Weak-to-Strong Transfer (WST), an automatic prompt
engineering framework where a small "Teacher" model generates instructions that
enhance the performance of a much larger "Student" model. Unlike prior work,
WST requires only a weak teacher, making it efficient and broadly applicable in
settings where large models are closed-source or difficult to fine-tune. Using
reinforcement learning, the Teacher Model's instructions are iteratively
improved based on the Student Model's outcomes, yielding substantial gains
across reasoning (MATH-500, GSM8K) and alignment (HH-RLHF) benchmarks - 98% on
MATH-500 and 134% on HH-RLHF - and surpassing baselines such as GPT-4o-mini and
Llama-70B. These results demonstrate that small models can reliably scaffold
larger ones, unlocking latent capabilities while avoiding misleading prompts
that stronger teachers may introduce, establishing WST as a scalable solution
for efficient and safe LLM prompt refinement.

objective. Experiments on the BIOSCAN-1M dataset show that hyperbolic embedding
achieves competitive performance with Euclidean baselines, and outperforms all
other models on unseen species classification using DNA barcodes. However,
fine-grained classification and open-world generalization remain challenging.

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability of large language models, yet understanding
how they learn and perform multi-step reasoning remains an open problem. In
this study, we explore how different architectures and training methods affect
model multi-step reasoning capabilities within a cellular automata framework.
By training on state sequences generated with random Boolean functions for
random initial conditions to exclude memorization, we demonstrate that most
neural architectures learn to abstract the underlying rules. While models
achieve high accuracy in next-state prediction, their performance declines
sharply if multi-step reasoning is required. We confirm that increasing model
depth plays a crucial role for sequential computations. We demonstrate that an
extension of the effective model depth with recurrence, memory, and test-time
compute scaling substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Early efforts on leveraging self-supervised learning (SSL) to improve machine
learning (ML) fairness has proven promising. However, such an approach has yet
to be explored within a multimodal context. Prior work has shown that, within a
multimodal setting, different modalities contain modality-unique information
that can complement information of other modalities. Leveraging on this, we
propose a novel subject-level loss function to learn fairer representations via
the following three mechanisms, adapting the variance-invariance-covariance
regularization (VICReg) method: (i) the variance term, which reduces reliance
on the protected attribute as a trivial solution; (ii) the invariance term,
which ensures consistent predictions for similar individuals; and (iii) the
covariance term, which minimizes correlational dependence on the protected
attribute. Consequently, our loss function, coined as FAIRWELL, aims to obtain
subject-independent representations, enforcing fairness in multimodal
prediction tasks. We evaluate our method on three challenging real-world
heterogeneous healthcare datasets (i.e. D-Vlog, MIMIC and MODMA) which contain
different modalities of varying length and different prediction tasks. Our
findings indicate that our framework improves overall fairness performance with
minimal reduction in classification performance and significantly improves on
the performance-fairness Pareto frontier.

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of integrated circuit design have led to
increased challenges in Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach to assist EDA design as
circuits can be naturally represented as graphs. While GNNs offer a foundation
for circuit analysis, they often fail to capture the full complexity of EDA
designs. Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) can better interpret EDA
circuit graphs as they capture both topological relationships and geometric
features. However, the improved representation capability comes at the cost of
even higher computational complexity and processing cost due to their serial
module-wise message-passing scheme, creating a significant performance
bottleneck. In this paper, we propose DR-CircuitGNN, a fast GPU kernel design
by leveraging row-wise sparsity-aware Dynamic-ReLU and optimizing SpMM kernels
during heterogeneous message-passing to accelerate HGNNs training on
EDA-related circuit graph datasets. To further enhance performance, we propose
a parallel optimization strategy that maximizes CPU-GPU concurrency by
concurrently processing independent subgraphs using multi-threaded CPU
initialization and GPU kernel execution via multiple cudaStreams. Our
experiments show that on three representative CircuitNet designs (small,
medium, large), the proposed method can achieve up to 3.51x and 4.09x speedup
compared to the SOTA for forward and backward propagation, respectively. On
full-size CircuitNet and sampled Mini-CircuitNet, our parallel design enables
up to 2.71x speed up over the official DGL implementation cuSPARSE with
negligible impact on correlation scores and error rates.

Abstract: Inferring temporal interaction graphs and higher-order structure from neural
signals is a key problem in building generative models for systems
neuroscience. Foundation models for large-scale neural data represent shared
latent structures of neural signals. However, extracting interpretable latent
graph representations in foundation models remains challenging and unsolved.
Here we explore latent graph learning in generative models of neural signals.
By testing against numerical simulations of neural circuits with known
ground-truth connectivity, we evaluate several hypotheses for explaining
learned model weights. We discover modest alignment between extracted network
representations and the underlying directed graphs and strong alignment in the
co-input graph representations. These findings motivate paths towards
incorporating graph-based geometric constraints in the construction of
large-scale foundation models for neural data.

Abstract: Quantization offers a practical solution to deploy LLMs in
resource-constraint environments. However, its impact on internal
representations remains understudied, raising questions about the reliability
of quantized models. In this study, we employ a range of interpretability
techniques to investigate how quantization affects model and neuron behavior.
We analyze multiple LLMs under 4-bit and 8-bit quantization. Our findings
reveal that the impact of quantization on model calibration is generally minor.
Analysis of neuron activations indicates that the number of dead neurons, i.e.,
those with activation values close to 0 across the dataset, remains consistent
regardless of quantization. In terms of neuron contribution to predictions, we
observe that smaller full precision models exhibit fewer salient neurons,
whereas larger models tend to have more, with the exception of Llama-2-7B. The
effect of quantization on neuron redundancy varies across models. Overall, our
findings suggest that effect of quantization may vary by model and tasks,
however, we did not observe any drastic change which may discourage the use of
quantization as a reliable model compression technique.

TL;DR: 提出一种Anchored Mixture of Experts模型，结合贝叶斯回归和软路由机制，在理论和实验中都表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不确定性回归问题，结合概率与点估计，提升模型的表达能力和准确性。

Method: 使用梯度提升模型作为锚点，投影到潜在空间，通过可学习的度量窗口核进行局部评分，软路由将样本分配给专家网络，训练中最大化对数似然。

Result: 在理论上达到最小最大风险率，测试指标具有效率，实验证明优于或等于SOTA的回归模型。

Conclusion: Anchor-MoE是一个高效的概率回归模型，不仅理论保证优越，还在多个数据集上取得了领先性能。

Abstract: Regression under uncertainty is fundamental across science and engineering.
We present an Anchored Mixture of Experts (Anchor-MoE), a model that handles
both probabilistic and point regression. For simplicity, we use a tuned
gradient-boosting model to furnish the anchor mean; however, any off-the-shelf
point regressor can serve as the anchor. The anchor prediction is projected
into a latent space, where a learnable metric-window kernel scores locality and
a soft router dispatches each sample to a small set of mixture-density-network
experts; the experts produce a heteroscedastic correction and predictive
variance. We train by minimizing negative log-likelihood, and on a disjoint
calibration split fit a post-hoc linear map on predicted means to improve point
accuracy. On the theory side, assuming a H\"older smooth regression function of
order~$\alpha$ and fixed Lipschitz partition-of-unity weights with bounded
overlap, we show that Anchor-MoE attains the minimax-optimal $L^2$ risk rate
$O\!\big(N^{-2\alpha/(2\alpha+d)}\big)$. In addition, the CRPS test
generalization gap scales as
$\widetilde{O}\!\Big(\sqrt{(\log(Mh)+P+K)/N}\Big)$; it is logarithmic in $Mh$
and scales as the square root in $P$ and $K$. Under bounded-overlap routing,
$K$ can be replaced by $k$, and any dependence on a latent dimension is
absorbed into $P$. Under uniformly bounded means and variances, an analogous
$\widetilde{O}\!\big(\sqrt{(\log(Mh)+P+K)/N}\big)$ scaling holds for the test
NLL up to constants. Empirically, across standard UCI regressions, Anchor-MoE
consistently matches or surpasses the strong NGBoost baseline in RMSE and NLL;
on several datasets it achieves new state-of-the-art probabilistic regression
results on our benchmark suite. Code is available at

Result: 在连续正则流、时间序列预测和轨迹预测等多个任务中表现出色，验证了UPN的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UPN有效结合连续建模与不确定性量化，为动态系统的预测提供了新的工具和思路。

Abstract: This paper introduces Uncertainty Propagation Network (UPN), a novel family
of neural differential equations that naturally incorporate uncertainty
quantification into continuous-time modeling. Unlike existing neural ODEs that
predict only state trajectories, UPN simultaneously model both state evolution
and its associated uncertainty by parameterizing coupled differential equations
for mean and covariance dynamics. The architecture efficiently propagates
uncertainty through nonlinear dynamics without discretization artifacts by
solving coupled ODEs for state and covariance evolution while enabling
state-dependent, learnable process noise. The continuous-depth formulation
adapts its evaluation strategy to each input's complexity, provides principled
uncertainty quantification, and handles irregularly-sampled observations
naturally. Experimental results demonstrate UPN's effectiveness across multiple
domains: continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with uncertainty quantification,
time-series forecasting with well-calibrated confidence intervals, and robust
trajectory prediction in both stable and chaotic dynamical systems.

Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) hold a key position in machine
learning on graphs, but they struggle with unintended behaviors, such as
over-smoothing and over-squashing, due to irregular data structures. The
observation and formulation of these limitations have become foundational in
constructing more informative graph representations. In this paper, we delve
into the limitations of MPNNs, focusing on aspects that have previously been
overlooked. Our observations reveal that even within a single layer, the
information specific to an individual node can become significantly diluted. To
delve into this phenomenon in depth, we present the concept of Over-dilution
and formulate it with two dilution factors: intra-node dilution for
attribute-level and inter-node dilution for node-level representations. We also
introduce a transformer-based solution that alleviates over-dilution and
complements existing node embedding methods like MPNNs. Our findings provide
new insights and contribute to the development of informative representations.

Abstract: Modern manufacturing relies heavily on fusion welding processes, including
gas metal arc welding (GMAW). Despite significant advances in machine
learning-based quality prediction, current models exhibit critical limitations
when confronted with the inherent distribution shifts that occur in dynamic
manufacturing environments. In this work, we extend the VQ-VAE Transformer
architecture - previously demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in weld
quality prediction - by leveraging its autoregressive loss as a reliable
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection mechanism. Our approach exhibits superior
performance compared to conventional reconstruction methods, embedding
error-based techniques, and other established baselines. By integrating OOD
detection with continual learning strategies, we optimize model adaptation,
triggering updates only when necessary and thereby minimizing costly labeling
requirements. We introduce a novel quantitative metric that simultaneously
evaluates OOD detection capability while interpreting in-distribution
performance. Experimental validation in real-world welding scenarios
demonstrates that our framework effectively maintains robust quality prediction
capabilities across significant distribution shifts, addressing critical
challenges in dynamic manufacturing environments where process parameters
frequently change. This research makes a substantial contribution to applied
artificial intelligence by providing an explainable and at the same time
adaptive solution for quality assurance in dynamic manufacturing processes - a
crucial step towards robust, practical AI systems in the industrial
environment.

Abstract: Industrial chain plays an increasingly important role in the sustainable
development of national economy. However, as a typical complex network,
data-driven deep learning is still in its infancy in describing and analyzing
the resilience of complex networks, and its core is the lack of a theoretical
framework to describe the system dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
physically informative neural symbolic approach to describe the evolutionary
dynamics of complex networks for resilient prediction. The core idea is to
learn the dynamics of the activity state of physical entities and integrate it
into the multi-layer spatiotemporal co-evolution network, and use the physical
information method to realize the joint learning of physical symbol dynamics
and spatiotemporal co-evolution topology, so as to predict the industrial chain
resilience. The experimental results show that the model can obtain better
results and predict the elasticity of the industry chain more accurately and
effectively, which has certain practical significance for the development of
the industry.

Motivation: 解决传统微观结构到材料性能预测成本高和缺乏可解释性的问题，结合分析方法和深度学习提高效率与透明度。

Method: 结合强对比展开（SCE）理论，设计神经对比展开（NCE）架构，从结构-性能数据学习PDE核，无需场测量。

Conclusion: NCE实现了复合材料性能的高效、可解释预测，突破了传统方法的局限，适合实际材料开发。

Abstract: Effective properties of composite materials are defined as the ensemble
average of property-specific PDE solutions over the underlying microstructure
distributions. Traditionally, predicting such properties can be done by solving
PDEs derived from microstructure samples or building data-driven models that
directly map microstructure samples to properties. The former has a higher
running cost, but provides explainable sensitivity information that may guide
material design; the latter could be more cost-effective if the data overhead
is amortized, but its learned sensitivities are often less explainable. With a
focus on properties governed by linear self-adjoint PDEs (e.g., Laplace,
Helmholtz, and Maxwell curl-curl) defined on bi-phase microstructures, we
propose a structure-property model that is both cost-effective and explainable.
Our method is built on top of the strong contrast expansion (SCE) formalism,
which analytically maps $N$-point correlations of an unbounded random field to
its effective properties. Since real-world material samples have finite sizes
and analytical PDE kernels are not always available, we propose Neural Contrast
Expansion (NCE), an SCE-inspired architecture to learn surrogate PDE kernels
from structure-property data. For static conduction and electromagnetic wave
propagation cases, we show that NCE models reveal accurate and insightful
sensitivity information useful for material design. Compared with other PDE
kernel learning methods, our method does not require measurements about the PDE
solution fields, but rather only requires macroscopic property measurements
that are more accessible in material development contexts.

Abstract: Map-to-map matching is a critical task for aligning spatial data across
heterogeneous sources, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of ground
truth correspondences, sparse node features, and scalability demands. In this
paper, we propose an unsupervised graph-based framework that addresses these
challenges through three key innovations. First, our method is an unsupervised
learning approach that requires no training data, which is crucial for
large-scale map data where obtaining labeled training samples is challenging.
Second, we introduce pseudo coordinates that capture the relative spatial
layout of nodes within each map, which enhances feature discriminability and
enables scale-invariant learning. Third, we design an mechanism to adaptively
balance feature and geometric similarity, as well as a geometric-consistent
loss function, ensuring robustness to noisy or incomplete coordinate data. At
the implementation level, to handle large-scale maps, we develop a tile-based
post-processing pipeline with overlapping regions and majority voting, which
enables parallel processing while preserving boundary coherence. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy in matching tasks, surpassing existing methods by a large margin,
particularly in high-noise and large-scale scenarios. Our framework provides a
scalable and practical solution for map alignment, offering a robust and
efficient alternative to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Neural-Network (NN) based turbulence closures have been developed for being
used as pre-trained surrogates for traditional turbulence closures, with the
aim to increase computational efficiency and prediction accuracy of CFD
simulations. The bottleneck to the widespread adaptation of these ML-based
closures is the relative lack of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for these
models. Especially, quantifying uncertainties associated with out-of-training
inputs, that is when the ML-based turbulence closures are queried on inputs
outside their training data regime. In the current paper, a published algebraic
turbulence closure1 has been utilized to compare the quality of epistemic UQ
between three NN-based methods and Gaussian Process (GP). The three NN-based
methods explored are Deep Ensembles (DE), Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD), and
Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI). In the in-training results, we find the
exact GP performs the best in accuracy with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of
$2.14 \cdot 10^{-5}$ followed by the DE with an RMSE of $4.59 \cdot 10^{-4}$.
Next, the paper discusses the performance of the four methods for quantifying
out-of-training uncertainties. For performance, the Exact GP yet again is the
best in performance, but has similar performance to the DE in the
out-of-training regions. In UQ accuracy for the out-of-training case, SVI and
DE hold the best miscalibration error for one of the cases. However, the DE
performs the best in Negative Log-Likelihood for both out-of-training cases. We
observe that for the current problem, in terms of accuracy GP > DE > SV I >
MCD. The DE results are relatively robust and provide intuitive UQ estimates,
despite performing naive ensembling. In terms of computational cost, the GP is
significantly higher than the NN-based methods with a $O(n^3)$ computational
complexity for each training step

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly bottlenecked by the cost of
optimization, both in terms of GPU memory and compute time. Existing
acceleration techniques, such as mixed precision, second-order methods, and
batch size scaling, are typically used in isolation. We present Tri-Accel, a
unified optimization framework that co-adapts three acceleration strategies
along with adaptive parameters during training: (1) Precision-Adaptive Updates
that dynamically assign mixed-precision levels to layers based on curvature and
gradient variance; (2) Sparse Second-Order Signals that exploit Hessian/Fisher
sparsity patterns to guide precision and step size decisions; and (3)
Memory-Elastic Batch Scaling that adjusts batch size in real time according to
VRAM availability. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0, Tri-Accel
achieves up to 9.9% reduction in training time and 13.3% lower memory usage,
while improving accuracy by +1.1 percentage points over FP32 baselines. Tested
on CIFAR-10/100, our approach demonstrates adaptive learning behavior, with
efficiency gradually improving over the course of training as the system learns
to allocate resources more effectively. Compared to static mixed-precision
training, Tri-Accel maintains 78.1% accuracy while reducing memory footprint
from 0.35GB to 0.31GB on standard hardware. The framework is implemented with
custom Triton kernels, whose hardware-aware adaptation enables automatic
optimization without manual hyperparameter tuning, making it practical for
deployment across diverse computational environments. This work demonstrates
how algorithmic adaptivity and hardware awareness can be combined to improve
scalability in resource-constrained settings, paving the way for more efficient
neural network training on edge devices and cost-sensitive cloud deployments.

Abstract: The growing adoption of home banking systems has heightened the risk of
cyberfraud, necessitating fraud detection mechanisms that are not only accurate
but also fair and explainable. While AI models have shown promise in this
domain, they face key limitations, including computational inefficiency, the
interpretability challenges of spiking neural networks (SNNs), and the
complexity and convergence instability of hyper-heuristic reinforcement
learning (RL)-based hyperparameter optimization. To address these issues, we
propose a novel framework that integrates a Cortical Spiking Network with
Population Coding (CSNPC) and a Reinforcement-Guided Hyper-Heuristic Optimizer
for Spiking Systems (RHOSS). The CSNPC, a biologically inspired SNN, employs
population coding for robust classification, while RHOSS uses Q-learning to
dynamically select low-level heuristics for hyperparameter optimization under
fairness and recall constraints. Embedded within the Modular Supervisory
Framework for Spiking Network Training and Interpretation (MoSSTI), the system
incorporates explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically, saliency-based
attribution and spike activity profiling, to increase transparency. Evaluated
on the Bank Account Fraud (BAF) dataset suite, our model achieves a $90.8\%$
recall at a strict $5\%$ false positive rate (FPR), outperforming
state-of-the-art spiking and non-spiking models while maintaining over $98\%$
predictive equality across key demographic attributes. The explainability
module further confirms that saliency attributions align with spiking dynamics,
validating interpretability. These results demonstrate the potential of
combining population-coded SNNs with reinforcement-guided hyper-heuristics for
fair, transparent, and high-performance fraud detection in real-world financial
applications.

Conclusion: 注意力输出的低维性是稀疏字典学习中的关键因素，子空间约束训练提供了有效解决方案，并丰富了对注意力几何结构的理解。

Abstract: While transformer models are widely believed to operate in high-dimensional
hidden spaces, we show that attention outputs are confined to a surprisingly
low-dimensional subspace, where about 60\% of the directions account for 99\%
of the variance--a phenomenon that is induced by the attention output
projection matrix and consistently observed across diverse model families and
datasets. Critically, we find this low-rank structure as a fundamental cause of
the prevalent dead feature problem in sparse dictionary learning, where it
creates a mismatch between randomly initialized features and the intrinsic
geometry of the activation space. Building on this insight, we propose a
subspace-constrained training method for sparse autoencoders (SAEs),
initializing feature directions into the active subspace of activations. Our
approach reduces dead features from 87\% to below 1\% in Attention Output SAEs
with 1M features, and can further extend to other sparse dictionary learning
methods. Our findings provide both new insights into the geometry of attention
and practical tools for improving sparse dictionary learning in large language
models.

Abstract: Handling data staleness remains a significant challenge in federated learning
with highly time-sensitive tasks, where data is generated continuously and data
staleness largely affects model performance. Although recent works attempt to
optimize data staleness by determining local data update frequency or client
selection strategy, none of them explore taking both data staleness and data
volume into consideration. In this paper, we propose DUFL(Data Updating in
Federated Learning), an incentive mechanism featuring an innovative local data
update scheme manipulated by three knobs: the server's payment, outdated data
conservation rate, and clients' fresh data collection volume, to coordinate
staleness and volume of local data for best utilities. To this end, we
introduce a novel metric called DoS(the Degree of Staleness) to quantify data
staleness and conduct a theoretic analysis illustrating the quantitative
relationship between DoS and model performance. We model DUFL as a two-stage
Stackelberg game with dynamic constraint, deriving the optimal local data
update strategy for each client in closed-form and the approximately optimal
strategy for the server. Experimental results on real-world datasets
demonstrate the significant performance of our approach.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results in generative
modelling but remain computationally intensive at inference time, often
requiring thousands of discretization steps. To this end, we propose Sig-DEG
(Signature-based Differential Equation Generator), a novel generator for
distilling pre-trained diffusion models, which can universally approximate the
backward diffusion process at a coarse temporal resolution. Inspired by
high-order approximations of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), Sig-DEG
leverages partial signatures to efficiently summarize Brownian motion over
sub-intervals and adopts a recurrent structure to enable accurate global
approximation of the SDE solution. Distillation is formulated as a supervised
learning task, where Sig-DEG is trained to match the outputs of a
fine-resolution diffusion model on a coarse time grid. During inference,
Sig-DEG enables fast generation, as the partial signature terms can be
simulated exactly without requiring fine-grained Brownian paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Sig-DEG achieves competitive generation quality while reducing
the number of inference steps by an order of magnitude. Our results highlight
the effectiveness of signature-based approximations for efficient generative
modeling.

Conclusion: RuscaRL有效打破了推理探索瓶颈，为LLMs推理能力提升提供了新途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the
potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of
reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma
persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet
the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of
LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be
explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded
Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework
designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning.
Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit
scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics
are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse
high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time,
encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2)
verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain
robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL
on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding
reasoning boundaries under the best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL
significantly boosts Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500,
surpassing GPT-4.1. Furthermore, our fine-tuned variant on
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading
LLMs including OpenAI-o3.

*Manan Gupta,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Polysemanticity Index (PSI)用于量化神经元的多义性，揭示深层网络中多义神经元的存在及其特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解神经网络中多义神经元对模型可解释性的影响，提供定量工具进行研究。

Method: 引入多义性指数（PSI），结合几何聚类质量、类别对齐和开放词汇语义差异，通过实验验证其有效性。

Result: 在预训练ResNet-50模型中，PSI成功识别出具有语义明确原型的神经元，并发现后层神经元的多义性更强，经多种验证确认其稳健性。

Conclusion: PSI为研究神经网络中的多义性提供了理论基础和实践工具，有助于深层网络机制的理解与分析。

Abstract: Neural networks often contain polysemantic neurons that respond to multiple,
sometimes unrelated, features, complicating mechanistic interpretability. We
introduce the Polysemanticity Index (PSI), a null-calibrated metric that
quantifies when a neuron's top activations decompose into semantically distinct
clusters. PSI multiplies three independently calibrated components: geometric
cluster quality (S), alignment to labeled categories (Q), and open-vocabulary
semantic distinctness via CLIP (D). On a pretrained ResNet-50 evaluated with
Tiny-ImageNet images, PSI identifies neurons whose activation sets split into
coherent, nameable prototypes, and reveals strong depth trends: later layers
exhibit substantially higher PSI than earlier layers. We validate our approach
with robustness checks (varying hyperparameters, random seeds, and
cross-encoder text heads), breadth analyses (comparing class-only vs.
open-vocabulary concepts), and causal patch-swap interventions. In particular,
aligned patch replacements increase target-neuron activation significantly more
than non-aligned, random, shuffled-position, or ablate-elsewhere controls. PSI
thus offers a principled and practical lever for discovering, quantifying, and
studying polysemantic units in neural networks.

Motivation: 探索大模型中反思机制的内在机制，补充现有反思策略研究的不足。

Result: 证实了反思指令的系统识别性及反思行为的可控性，发现抑制反思比激发更易。

Conclusion: 为理解大模型反思思维提供新的机制框架，有助于增强或抑制反思行为。

Abstract: Reflection, the ability of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate and
revise their own reasoning, has been widely used to improve performance on
complex reasoning tasks. Yet, most prior work emphasizes designing reflective
prompting strategies or reinforcement learning objectives, leaving the inner
mechanisms of reflection underexplored. In this paper, we investigate
reflection through the lens of latent directions in model activations. We
propose a methodology based on activation steering to characterize how
instructions with different reflective intentions: no reflection, intrinsic
reflection, and triggered reflection. By constructing steering vectors between
these reflection levels, we demonstrate that (1) new reflection-inducing
instructions can be systematically identified, (2) reflective behavior can be
directly enhanced or suppressed through activation interventions, and (3)
suppressing reflection is considerably easier than stimulating it. Experiments
on GSM8k-adv with Qwen2.5-3B and Gemma3-4B reveal clear stratification across
reflection levels, and steering interventions confirm the controllability of
reflection. Our findings highlight both opportunities (e.g.,
reflection-enhancing defenses) and risks (e.g., adversarial inhibition of
reflection in jailbreak attacks). This work opens a path toward mechanistic
understanding of reflective reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种在线学习算法，能够在具有长远预算限制的对抗性环境下，优化成本并高效利用资源，适用范围广，包括多种非凸优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在具有长远预算约束的对抗性在线学习问题中的优化挑战。

Method: 提出一阶在线算法，保证$O(oot T)$的$	arget$-遗憾，且资源消耗满足特定上线条件，涵盖完整信息和带Bandit反馈两种设置。

Result: 算法在两种反馈环境下均实现了理论最优界，且问题的界限已被匹配下界证实，适应广泛的$	arget$-近似凸函数类。

Conclusion: 研究拓展了具有长远预算限制的对抗性在线学习方法，为多种非凸优化提供理论基础，具备实际应用价值。

Abstract: We study an online learning problem with long-term budget constraints in the
adversarial setting. In this problem, at each round $t$, the learner selects an
action from a convex decision set, after which the adversary reveals a cost
function $f_t$ and a resource consumption function $g_t$. The cost and
consumption functions are assumed to be $\alpha$-approximately convex - a broad
class that generalizes convexity and encompasses many common non-convex
optimization problems, including DR-submodular maximization, Online Vertex
Cover, and Regularized Phase Retrieval. The goal is to design an online
algorithm that minimizes cumulative cost over a horizon of length $T$ while
approximately satisfying a long-term budget constraint of $B_T$. We propose an
efficient first-order online algorithm that guarantees $O(\sqrt{T})$
$\alpha$-regret against the optimal fixed feasible benchmark while consuming at
most $O(B_T \log T)+ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ resources in both full-information
and bandit feedback settings. In the bandit feedback setting, our approach
yields an efficient solution for the $\texttt{Adversarial Bandits with
Knapsacks}$ problem with improved guarantees. We also prove matching lower
bounds, demonstrating the tightness of our results. Finally, we characterize
the class of $\alpha$-approximately convex functions and show that our results
apply to a broad family of problems.

Result: 验证了CARTRIDGE关键字作为检索路由的作用，压缩主要在价值向量中实现，SCI加快收敛速度，为未来训练优化提供基础。

Conclusion: 深入理解CARTRIDGE的结构和优化策略，有助于推进大规模长上下文LLM的高效推理。

Abstract: A bottleneck for long-context LLM inference is the linearly growing KV cache.
Recent work has proposed CARTRIDGES, an approach which leverages offline
compute to train a much smaller KV cache than is typically required for a full
document (up to 40x less memory usage at inference time). In this paper, we
present the first mechanistic exploration of the learned CARTRIDGE key-value
cache structure. In particular, we propose that (1) CARTRIDGE keys act as
stable, shareable retrieval routers for the compressed corpora and (2) most of
the learned compression occurs within the CARTRIDGE value vectors. We present
empirical evidence of our routing theory across tasks, model families, and
model sizes; for example, we can ablate the learned CARTRIDGE key vectors
between tasks with little performance loss. Finally, we propose a slight
improvement in initialization called Sampled Chunk Initialization (SCI). We
suggest that SCI can lead to faster CARTRIDGE convergence than previously
demonstrated in the literature. Our findings lay the groundwork for broader
empirical study of CARTRIDGE training optimization which may be crucial for
further scaling.

Conclusion: TabResFlow有效提升表格单变量回归的预测可信度和模型表达能力，具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: Tabular regression is a well-studied problem with numerous industrial
applications, yet most existing approaches focus on point estimation, often
leading to overconfident predictions. This issue is particularly critical in
industrial automation, where trustworthy decision-making is essential.
Probabilistic regression models address this challenge by modeling prediction
uncertainty. However, many conventional methods assume a fixed-shape
distribution (typically Gaussian), and resort to estimating distribution
parameters. This assumption is often restrictive, as real-world target
distributions can be highly complex. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
TabResFlow, a Normalizing Spline Flow model designed specifically for
univariate tabular regression, where commonly used simple flow networks like
RealNVP and Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) are unsuitable. TabResFlow
consists of three key components: (1) An MLP encoder for each numerical
feature. (2) A fully connected ResNet backbone for expressive feature
extraction. (3) A conditional spline-based normalizing flow for flexible and
tractable density estimation. We evaluate TabResFlow on nine public benchmark
datasets, demonstrating that it consistently surpasses existing probabilistic
regression models on likelihood scores. Our results demonstrate 9.64%
improvement compared to the strongest probabilistic regression model
(TreeFlow), and on average 5.6 times speed-up in inference time compared to the
strongest deep learning alternative (NodeFlow). Additionally, we validate the
practical applicability of TabResFlow in a real-world used car price prediction
task under selective regression. To measure performance in this setting, we
introduce a novel Area Under Risk Coverage (AURC) metric and show that
TabResFlow achieves superior results across this metric.

Abstract: This thesis develops computational methods in similarity-preserving hashing,
classification, and cancer genomics. Standard space partitioning-based hashing
relies on Binary Search Trees (BSTs), but their exponential growth and sparsity
hinder efficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Compressed BST of Inverted
hash tables (ComBI), which enables fast approximate nearest-neighbor search
with reduced memory. On datasets of up to one billion samples, ComBI achieves
0.90 precision with 4X-296X speed-ups over Multi-Index Hashing, and also
outperforms Cellfishing.jl on single-cell RNA-seq searches with 2X-13X gains.
Building on hashing structures, we propose Guided Random Forest (GRAF), a
tree-based ensemble classifier that integrates global and local partitioning,
bridging decision trees and boosting while reducing generalization error.
Across 115 datasets, GRAF delivers competitive or superior accuracy, and its
unsupervised variant (uGRAF) supports guided hashing and importance sampling.
We show that GRAF and ComBI can be used to estimate per-sample classifiability,
which enables scalable prediction of cancer patient survival. To address
challenges in interpreting mutations, we introduce Continuous Representation of
Codon Switches (CRCS), a deep learning framework that embeds genetic changes
into numerical vectors. CRCS allows identification of somatic mutations without
matched normals, discovery of driver genes, and scoring of tumor mutations,
with survival prediction validated in bladder, liver, and brain cancers.
Together, these methods provide efficient, scalable, and interpretable tools
for large-scale data analysis and biomedical applications.

Adaptive Kalman Filter. We analyse their performance using simulated train
operation datasets with and without Wheel Slide Protection activation. Our
results reveal that CNN-based approaches, especially the multiple-branch model,
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to traditional methods,
particularly under challenging operational conditions. These findings highlight
the potential of deep learning techniques to enhance railway safety and
operational efficiency by more effectively capturing intricate patterns in
complex transportation datasets.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools on graph data. However, their
predictions are mis-calibrated and lack interpretability, limiting their
adoption in critical applications. To address this issue, we propose a new
uncertainty-aware and interpretable graph classification model that combines
graph functional neural process and graph generative model. The core of our
method is to assume a set of latent rationales which can be mapped to a
probabilistic embedding space; the predictive distribution of the classifier is
conditioned on such rationale embeddings by learning a stochastic correlation
matrix. The graph generator serves to decode the graph structure of the
rationales from the embedding space for model interpretability. For efficient
model training, we adopt an alternating optimization procedure which mimics the
well known Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method is
general and can be applied to any existing GNN architecture. Extensive
experiments on five graph classification datasets demonstrate that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both uncertainty
quantification and GNN interpretability. We also conduct case studies to show
that the decoded rationale structure can provide meaningful explanations.

Motivation: 解决分布式学习中拜占庭容错能力不足和通信成本高的问题，同时研究两者结合的影响。

Method: 引入结合经典动量和协调压缩机制的RoSDHB算法，在较少假设条件下实现对拜占庭节点评估的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验显示RoSDHB在比现有方法（如Byz-DASHA-PAGE）更少假设条件下，保持了竞争性能，并显著降低通信成本。

Conclusion: RoSDHB在保证拜占庭容错能力的同时，提高了通信效率，验证了其在分布式学习中的实用性。

Abstract: Distributed learning (DL) enables scalable model training over decentralized
data, but remains challenged by Byzantine faults and high communication costs.
While both issues have been studied extensively in isolation, their interaction
is less explored. Prior work shows that naively combining communication
compression with Byzantine-robust aggregation degrades resilience to faulty
nodes (or workers). The state-of-the-art algorithm, namely Byz-DASHA-PAGE [29],
makes use of the momentum variance reduction scheme to mitigate the detrimental
impact of compression noise on Byzantine-robustness. We propose a new
algorithm, named RoSDHB, that integrates the classic Polyak's momentum with a
new coordinated compression mechanism. We show that RoSDHB performs comparably
to Byz-DASHA-PAGE under the standard (G, B)-gradient dissimilarity
heterogeneity model, while it relies on fewer assumptions. In particular, we
only assume Lipschitz smoothness of the average loss function of the honest
workers, in contrast to [29]that additionally assumes a special smoothness of
bounded global Hessian variance. Empirical results on benchmark image
classification task show that RoSDHB achieves strong robustness with
significant communication savings.

Motivation: 大规模Mixture-of-Experts模型在边缘设备部署面临内存限制，传统策略难以维护高缓存命中率。

Method: 引入基于Transformer的学习型专家激活预测器，将任务定义为多标签序列预测，使用大规模专家激活轨迹进行训练。

Result: 预测器在未见提示上实现97.5%准确率和86.6% F1-score，在仿真中将GPU缓存命中率由17%提升至72%，优于传统策略。

Conclusion: 提出的学习型预测器提升了MoE模型在资源受限环境中的部署效率，有助于更好地在边缘设备上应用大模型。

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on edge devices
presents significant challenges due to memory constraints. While MoE
architectures enable efficient utilization of computational resources by
activating only a subset of experts per inference, they require careful memory
management to operate efficiently in resource-constrained environments.
Traditional heuristic-based expert caching strategies such as MoE-Infinity
struggle to maintain high cache hit rates as models parameters scale. In this
work, we introduce MoE-Beyond, a learning-based expert activation predictor
trained to predict expert activations during autoregressive decoding. By
framing the task as a multi-label sequence prediction problem, we train a
lightweight transformer model on 66 million expert activation traces extracted
from LDJnr-Puffin dataset [5] using DeepSeek-V2-Chat-Lite MoE. Our predictor
generalizes effectively across unseen prompts from WebGLM-QA dataset [6],
achieving 97.5% accuracy and an 86.6% F1-score. Simulation results show that
MoE-Beyond improves GPU cache hit rate from 17% to 72% when only 10% of experts
fit in GPU cache, outperforming heuristic baselines.

Conclusion: 战略性查询在有限-sum优化中具有显著优势，特别是在满足特定条件下能有效提升梯度方法的表现，是未来优化算法设计的重要方向。

Abstract: This paper considers a finite-sum optimization problem under first-order
queries and investigates the benefits of strategic querying on stochastic
gradient-based methods compared to uniform querying strategy. We first
introduce Oracle Gradient Querying (OGQ), an idealized algorithm that selects
one user's gradient yielding the largest possible expected improvement (EI) at
each step. However, OGQ assumes oracle access to the gradients of all users to
make such a selection, which is impractical in real-world scenarios. To address
this limitation, we propose Strategic Gradient Querying (SGQ), a practical
algorithm that has better transient-state performance than SGD while making
only one query per iteration. For smooth objective functions satisfying the
Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, we show that under the assumption of EI
heterogeneity, OGQ enhances transient-state performance and reduces
steady-state variance, while SGQ improves transient-state performance over SGD.
Our numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Clustering algorithms are widely used in various applications, with
density-based methods such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications
with Noise (DBSCAN) being particularly prominent. These algorithms identify
clusters in high-density regions while treating sparser areas as noise.
However, reliance on user-defined parameters often poses optimization
challenges that require domain expertise. This paper presents a novel
density-based clustering method inspired by the concept of selective attention,
which minimizes the need for user-defined parameters under standard conditions.
Initially, the algorithm operates without requiring user-defined parameters. If
parameter adjustment is needed, the method simplifies the process by
introducing a single integer parameter that is straightforward to tune. The
approach computes a threshold to filter out the most sparsely distributed
points and outliers, forms a preliminary cluster structure, and then
reintegrates the excluded points to finalize the results. Experimental
evaluations on diverse data sets highlight the accessibility and robust
performance of the method, providing an effective alternative for density-based
clustering tasks.

Abstract: Large language model fine-tuning APIs enable widespread model customization,
yet pose significant safety risks. Recent work shows that adversaries can
exploit access to these APIs to bypass model safety mechanisms by encoding
harmful content in seemingly harmless fine-tuning data, evading both human
monitoring and standard content filters. We formalize the fine-tuning API
defense problem, and introduce the Cipher Fine-tuning Robustness benchmark
(CIFR), a benchmark for evaluating defense strategies' ability to retain model
safety in the face of cipher-enabled attackers while achieving the desired
level of fine-tuning functionality. We include diverse cipher encodings and
families, with some kept exclusively in the test set to evaluate for
generalization across unseen ciphers and cipher families. We then evaluate
different defenses on the benchmark and train probe monitors on model internal
activations from multiple fine-tunes. We show that probe monitors achieve over
99% detection accuracy, generalize to unseen cipher variants and families, and
compare favorably to state-of-the-art monitoring approaches. We open-source
CIFR and the code to reproduce our experiments to facilitate further research

Conclusion: 结合信息几何结构的自然梯度与正交梯度，有助于提升连续学习中的优化效果。

Abstract: Orthogonal gradient descent has emerged as a powerful method for continual
learning tasks. However, its Euclidean projections overlook the underlying
information-geometric structure of the space of distributions parametrized by
neural networks, which can lead to suboptimal convergence in learning tasks. To
counteract this, we combine it with the idea of the natural gradient and
present ONG (Orthogonal Natural Gradient Descent). ONG preconditions each new
task gradient with an efficient EKFAC approximation of the inverse Fisher
information matrix, yielding updates that follow the steepest descent direction
under a Riemannian metric. To preserve performance on previously learned tasks,
ONG projects these natural gradients onto the orthogonal complement of prior
task gradients. We provide a theoretical justification for this procedure,
introduce the ONG algorithm, and benchmark its performance on the Permuted and
Rotated MNIST datasets. All code for our experiments/reproducibility can be

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection ensures safe and reliable model
deployment. Contemporary OOD algorithms using geometry projection can detect
OOD or adversarial samples from clean in-distribution (ID) samples. However,
this setting regards adversarial ID samples as OOD, leading to incorrect OOD
predictions. Existing efforts on OOD detection with ID and OOD data under
attacks are minimal. In this paper, we develop a robust OOD detection method
that distinguishes adversarial ID samples from OOD ones. The sharp loss
landscape created by adversarial training hinders model convergence, impacting
the latent embedding quality for OOD score calculation. Therefore, we introduce
a {\bf Sharpness-aware Geometric Defense (SaGD)} framework to smooth out the
rugged adversarial loss landscape in the projected latent geometry. Enhanced
geometric embedding convergence enables accurate ID data characterization,
benefiting OOD detection against adversarial attacks. We use Jitter-based
perturbation in adversarial training to extend the defense ability against
unseen attacks. Our SaGD framework significantly improves FPR and AUC over the
state-of-the-art defense approaches in differentiating CIFAR-100 from six other
OOD datasets under various attacks. We further examine the effects of
perturbations at various adversarial training levels, revealing the
relationship between the sharp loss landscape and adversarial OOD detection.

Abstract: Graphs have become a central representation in machine learning for capturing
relational and structured data across various domains. Traditional graph neural
networks often struggle to capture long-range dependencies between nodes due to
their local structure. Graph transformers overcome this by using attention
mechanisms that allow nodes to exchange information globally. However, there
are two types of attention in graph transformers: dense and sparse. In this
paper, we compare these two attention mechanisms, analyze their trade-offs, and
highlight when to use each. We also outline current challenges and problems in
designing attention for graph transformers.

Motivation: 理解大型语言模型中的过度自信行为，以期改善其在高风险场景中的表现。

Method: 采用开放源码的Llama 3.2模型，并在包含人类标注的自信性数据集上进行微调，通过提取残差激活与计算相似性指标，定位关键的自信表示层，并分析其内部结构。

Result: 发现高自信表示由情感与逻辑两类正交子成分组成，情感成分影响整体预测准确性，逻辑成分带来局部性影响。

Conclusion: 揭示了模型自信的多组件结构，为降低模型的过度自信提供了潜在的干预路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often display overconfidence, presenting
information with unwarranted certainty in high-stakes contexts. We investigate
the internal basis of this behavior via mechanistic interpretability. Using
open-sourced Llama 3.2 models fine-tuned on human annotated assertiveness
datasets, we extract residual activations across all layers, and compute
similarity metrics to localize assertive representations. Our analysis
identifies layers most sensitive to assertiveness contrasts and reveals that
high-assertive representations decompose into two orthogonal sub-components of
emotional and logical clusters-paralleling the dual-route Elaboration
Likelihood Model in Psychology. Steering vectors derived from these
sub-components show distinct causal effects: emotional vectors broadly
influence prediction accuracy, while logical vectors exert more localized
effects. These findings provide mechanistic evidence for the multi-component
structure of LLM assertiveness and highlight avenues for mitigating
overconfident behavior.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have leveraged increased
test-time computation to enhance reasoning capabilities, a strategy that, while
effective, incurs significant latency and resource costs, limiting their
applicability in real-world time-constrained or cost-sensitive scenarios. This
paper introduces BudgetThinker, a novel framework designed to empower LLMs with
budget-aware reasoning, enabling precise control over the length of their
thought processes. We propose a methodology that periodically inserts special
control tokens during inference to continuously inform the model of its
remaining token budget. This approach is coupled with a comprehensive two-stage
training pipeline, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to familiarize
the model with budget constraints, followed by a curriculum-based Reinforcement
Learning (RL) phase that utilizes a length-aware reward function to optimize
for both accuracy and budget adherence. We demonstrate that BudgetThinker
significantly surpasses strong baselines in maintaining performance across a
variety of reasoning budgets on challenging mathematical benchmarks. Our method
provides a scalable and effective solution for developing efficient and
controllable LLM reasoning, making advanced models more practical for
deployment in resource-constrained and real-time environments.

Motivation: 随着LVLMs在医疗AI中的应用增多，模型的安全性成为亟需解决的问题，尤其是在依赖外部资料检索的系统中存在潜在攻击风险。

Method: 构建模拟半开放环境，利用跨模态冲突注入（CMCI）技术对模型进行对抗攻击，结合文本和图像的恶意干扰，实现对系统的脆弱性测试。

Result: 在医用影像问答任务中，攻击显著降低模型准确性，比如F1分数降低达27.66%，揭示了系统的安全隐患。

Conclusion: 医疗多模态RAG系统存在重大安全风险，需引入威胁感知设计和鲁棒性检测，确保临床应用的安全可靠。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) augmented with Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) are increasingly employed in medical AI to enhance factual
grounding through external clinical image-text retrieval. However, this
reliance creates a significant attack surface. We propose MedThreatRAG, a novel
multimodal poisoning framework that systematically probes vulnerabilities in
medical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs. A key innovation
of our approach is the construction of a simulated semi-open attack
environment, mimicking real-world medical systems that permit periodic
knowledge base updates via user or pipeline contributions. Within this setting,
we introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds
subtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports.
These mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal
alignment while remaining sufficiently plausible to evade conventional filters.
While basic textual and visual attacks are included for completeness, CMCI
demonstrates the most severe degradation. Evaluations on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR
QA tasks show that MedThreatRAG reduces answer F1 scores by up to 27.66% and
lowers LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates to as low as 51.36%. Our findings expose
fundamental security gaps in clinical RAG systems and highlight the urgent need
for threat-aware design and robust multimodal consistency checks. Finally, we
conclude with a concise set of guidelines to inform the safe development of
future multimodal medical RAG systems.

Abstract: With the rapidly increased number of vehicles in urban areas, existing road
infrastructure struggles to accommodate modern traffic demands, resulting in
the issue of congestion. This highlights the importance of efficient path
planning strategies. However, most recent navigation models focus solely on
deterministic or time-dependent networks, while overlooking the correlations
and the stochastic nature of traffic flows. In this work, we address the
reliable shortest path problem within stochastic transportation networks under
certain dependencies. We propose a path planning solution that integrates the
decision Transformer with the Generalized Policy Gradient (GPG) framework.
Based on the decision Transformer's capability to model long-term dependencies,
our proposed solution improves the accuracy and stability of path decisions.
Experimental results on the Sioux Falls Network (SFN) demonstrate that our
approach outperforms previous baselines in terms of on-time arrival
probability, providing more accurate path planning solutions.

Abstract: Hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) have demonstrated notable efficacy in
representing real-world data with hierarchical structures via exploiting the
geometric properties of hyperbolic spaces characterized by negative curvatures.
Curvature plays a crucial role in optimizing HNNs. Inappropriate curvatures may
cause HNNs to converge to suboptimal parameters, degrading overall performance.
So far, the theoretical foundation of the effect of curvatures on HNNs has not
been developed. In this paper, we derive a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound of
HNNs, highlighting the role of curvatures in the generalization of HNNs via
their effect on the smoothness of the loss landscape. Driven by the derived
bound, we propose a sharpness-aware curvature learning method to smooth the
loss landscape, thereby improving the generalization of HNNs. In our method,
  we design a scope sharpness measure for curvatures, which is minimized
through a bi-level optimization process. Then, we introduce an implicit
differentiation algorithm that efficiently solves the bi-level optimization by
approximating gradients of curvatures. We present the approximation error and
convergence analyses of the proposed method, showing that the approximation
error is upper-bounded, and the proposed method can converge by bounding
gradients of HNNs. Experiments on four settings: classification, learning from
long-tailed data, learning from noisy data, and few-shot learning show that our
method can improve the performance of HNNs.

Abstract: Transformer has become fundamental to a vast series of pre-trained large
models that have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications.
Machine unlearning, which focuses on efficiently removing specific data
influences to comply with privacy regulations, shows promise in restricting
updates to influence-critical parameters. However, existing parameter-efficient
unlearning methods are largely devised in a module-oblivious manner, which
tends to inaccurately identify these parameters and leads to inferior
unlearning performance for Transformers. In this paper, we propose {\tt
MAPE-Unlearn}, a module-aware parameter-efficient machine unlearning approach
that uses a learnable pair of masks to pinpoint influence-critical parameters
in the heads and filters of Transformers. The learning objective of these masks
is derived by desiderata of unlearning and optimized through an efficient
algorithm featured by a greedy search with a warm start. Extensive experiments
on various Transformer models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of {\tt MAPE-Unlearn} for unlearning.

Result: 有效秩作为关注点提供了符合模型实际表现的泛化估计，强调谱属性的重要性。

Conclusion: 谱性质，特别是注意力矩阵的有效秩，是理解大规模注意模型泛化的关键因素之一。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often contain far more parameters than training
examples, yet they still manage to generalize well in practice. Classical
complexity measures such as VC-dimension or PAC-Bayes bounds usually become
vacuous in this overparameterized regime, offering little explanation for the
empirical success of models like Transformers. In this work, I explore an
alternative notion of capacity for attention-based models, based on the
effective rank of their attention matrices. The intuition is that, although the
parameter count is enormous, the functional dimensionality of attention is
often much lower. I show that this quantity leads to a generalization bound
whose dependence on sample size matches empirical scaling laws observed in
large language models, up to logarithmic factors. While the analysis is not a
complete theory of overparameterized learning, it provides evidence that
spectral properties of attention, rather than raw parameter counts, may be the
right lens for understanding why these models generalize.

Abstract: . Predicting and calculating the aerodynamic coefficients of airfoils near

methods have made it possible to present the simulation results using methods

coefficients of airfoils near the ground surface are predicted with the help of
a neural network. This prediction can only be realized by providing data for
training and learning the code that contains information on the lift-to-drag
ratio of the primary data and images related to the airfoil cross-section,
which are converted into a matrix. One advantage of the VGG method over other
methods is that its results are more accurate than those of other CNN methods.

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have enabled highly accurate arrhythmia
detection from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, but limited interpretability
remains a barrier to clinical adoption. This study investigates the application
of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques specifically adapted for time-series ECG
analysis. Using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset, a convolutional neural
network-based model was developed for arrhythmia classification, with
R-peak-based segmentation via the Pan-Tompkins algorithm. To increase the
dataset size and to reduce class imbalance, an additional 12-lead ECG dataset
was incorporated. A user needs assessment was carried out to identify what kind
of explanation would be preferred by medical professionals. Medical
professionals indicated a preference for saliency map-based explanations over
counterfactual visualisations, citing clearer correspondence with ECG
interpretation workflows. Four SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based
approaches: permutation importance, KernelSHAP, gradient-based methods, and
Deep Learning Important FeaTures (DeepLIFT), were implemented and compared. The
model achieved 98.3% validation accuracy on MIT-BIH but showed performance
degradation on the combined dataset, underscoring dataset variability
challenges. Permutation importance and KernelSHAP produced cluttered visual
outputs, while gradient-based and DeepLIFT methods highlighted waveform regions
consistent with clinical reasoning, but with variability across samples.
Findings emphasize the need for domain-specific XAI adaptations in ECG analysis
and highlight saliency mapping as a more clinically intuitive approach

Result: 模型超越传统机器学习模型，准确性更高，并通过SHAP分析确认关键影响因素。

Conclusion: 该PINN框架为辐照合金疲劳寿命预测提供可靠、可解释的工具，有助于合金选择。

Abstract: This study proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework to
predict the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life of irradiated austenitic and
ferritic/martensitic (F/M) steels used in nuclear reactors. These materials
experience cyclic loading and irradiation at elevated temperatures, causing
complex degradation that traditional empirical models fail to capture
accurately. The developed PINN model incorporates physical fatigue life
constraints into its loss function, improving prediction accuracy and
generalizability. Trained on 495 data points, including both irradiated and
unirradiated conditions, the model outperforms traditional machine learning
models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and
the conventional Neural Network. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis
identifies strain amplitude, irradiation dose, and testing temperature as
dominant features, each inversely correlated with fatigue life, consistent with
physical understanding. PINN captures saturation behaviour in fatigue life at
higher strain amplitudes in F/M steels. Overall, the PINN framework offers a
reliable and interpretable approach for predicting fatigue life in irradiated
alloys, enabling informed alloy selection.

Conclusion: 动态调节稀疏度的方法增强了对模型内部表示的理解能力，为模型解释性提供了新工具。

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs)
remains a central challenge for interpretability research. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) offer a promising solution by decomposing activations into interpretable
features, but existing approaches rely on fixed sparsity constraints that fail
to account for input complexity. We propose Adaptive Top K Sparse Autoencoders
(AdaptiveK), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts sparsity levels based
on the semantic complexity of each input. Leveraging linear probes, we
demonstrate that context complexity is linearly encoded in LLM representations,
and we use this signal to guide feature allocation during training. Experiments
across three language models (Pythia-70M, Pythia-160M, and Gemma-2-2B)
demonstrate that this complexity-driven adaptation significantly outperforms
fixed-sparsity approaches on reconstruction fidelity, explained variance, and
cosine similarity metrics while eliminating the computational burden of
extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: 频率优先原则是趋势而非规则，方向更新和谐函数展开深刻影响频率学习特性，为理解复杂域上的神经网络学习提供新见解。

Abstract: We investigate the learning dynamics of shallow ReLU neural networks on the
unit sphere \(S^2\subset\mathbb{R}^3\) in polar coordinates \((\tau,\phi)\),
considering both fixed and trainable neuron directions \(\{w_i\}\). For fixed
weights, spherical harmonic expansions reveal an intrinsic low-frequency
preference with coefficients decaying as \(O(\ell^{5/2}/2^\ell)\), typically
leading to the Frequency Principle (FP) of lower-frequency-first learning.
However, this principle can be violated under specific initial conditions or
error distributions. With trainable weights, an additional rotation term in the
harmonic evolution equations preserves exponential decay with decay order
\(O(\ell^{7/2}/2^\ell)\) factor, also leading to the FP of
lower-frequency-first learning. But like fixed weights case, the principle can
be violated under specific initial conditions or error distributions. Our
numerical results demonstrate that trainable directions increase learning
complexity and can either maintain a low-frequency advantage or enable faster
high-frequency emergence. This analysis suggests the FP should be viewed as a
tendency rather than a rule on curved domains like \(S^2\), providing insights
into how direction updates and harmonic expansions shape frequency-dependent
learning.

code review and static analysis at scale, supporting tasks such as
vulnerability detection, summarization, and refactoring. In this paper, we
identify and exploit a critical vulnerability in LLM-based code analysis: an
abstraction bias that causes models to overgeneralize familiar programming
patterns and overlook small, meaningful bugs. Adversaries can exploit this
blind spot to hijack the control flow of the LLM's interpretation with minimal
edits and without affecting actual runtime behavior. We refer to this attack as
a Familiar Pattern Attack (FPA).
  We develop a fully automated, black-box algorithm that discovers and injects
FPAs into target code. Our evaluation shows that FPAs are not only effective,
but also transferable across models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0) and
universal across programming languages (Python, C, Rust, Go). Moreover, FPAs
remain effective even when models are explicitly warned about the attack via
robust system prompts. Finally, we explore positive, defensive uses of FPAs and
discuss their broader implications for the reliability and safety of
code-oriented LLMs.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，生成质量和语义连贯性优于现有最先进模型，并能处理更多模态。

Conclusion: ShaLa有效解决了多模态生成中的表达能力不足和复杂模态扩展的问题，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel generative framework for learning shared latent
representations across multimodal data. Many advanced multimodal methods focus
on capturing all combinations of modality-specific details across inputs, which
can inadvertently obscure the high-level semantic concepts that are shared
across modalities. Notably, Multimodal VAEs with low-dimensional latent
variables are designed to capture shared representations, enabling various
tasks such as joint multimodal synthesis and cross-modal inference. However,
multimodal VAEs often struggle to design expressive joint variational
posteriors and suffer from low-quality synthesis. In this work, ShaLa addresses
these challenges by integrating a novel architectural inference model and a
second-stage expressive diffusion prior, which not only facilitates effective
inference of shared latent representation but also significantly improves the
quality of downstream multimodal synthesis. We validate ShaLa extensively
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior coherence and synthesis
quality compared to state-of-the-art multimodal VAEs. Furthermore, ShaLa scales
to many more modalities while prior multimodal VAEs have fallen short in
capturing the increasing complexity of the shared latent space.

TL;DR: 提出FedERL，结合轻量级训练方法和服务器端增强，提高边缘设备上的联邦学习在噪声和天气等常见扰动下的鲁棒性，节省时间与能量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒训练技术计算成本高，不适合资源有限的边缘设备，且FL面临资源限制和鲁棒性挑战。

Method: 在服务器端采用数据无关的鲁棒训练（DART），无需访问训练数据，结合联邦学习框架，确保客户端无额外鲁棒性负担。

Result: 实验验证FedERL在资源有限情况下优于传统鲁棒训练，能有效应对常见扰动，显著节省时间和能量。

Conclusion: FedERL是面向实际应用的高效、可扩展的联邦鲁棒学习方案，适合边缘设备环境。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) accelerates the deployment of deep learning models on
edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL systems face challenges
due to client-side constraints on computational resources, and from a lack of
robustness to common corruptions such as noise, blur, and weather effects.
Existing robust training methods are computationally expensive and unsuitable
for resource-constrained clients. We propose FedERL, federated efficient and
robust learning, as the first work to explicitly address corruption robustness
under time and energy constraints on the client side. At its core, FedERL
employs a novel data-agnostic robust training (DART) method on the server to
enhance robustness without access to the training data. In doing so, FedERL
ensures zero robustness overhead for clients. Extensive experiments demonstrate
FedERL's ability to handle common corruptions at a fraction of the time and
energy cost of traditional robust training methods. In scenarios with limited
time and energy budgets, FedERL surpasses the performance of traditional robust
training, establishing it as a practical and scalable solution for real-world
FL applications.

Result: 在零-shot条件下优于现有最优方法，提供可解释且高效的预测。

Conclusion: 显式推理具有潜力，为图学习开辟新方向，丰富研究资源。

Abstract: Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-pecific supervision remains
challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited by fixed label spaces,
while Large Language Models (LLMs) lack structural inductive biases. Recent
advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) provide a zero-shot alternative via
explicit, long chain-of-thought reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a
GNN-free approach that reformulates graph tasks--node classification, link
prediction, and graph classification--as textual reasoning problems solved by
LRMs. We introduce the first datasets with detailed reasoning traces for these
tasks and develop Graph-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages
task-specific rethink templates to guide reasoning over linearized graphs.
Experiments demonstrate that Graph-R1 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
zero-shot settings, producing interpretable and effective predictions. Our work
highlights the promise of explicit reasoning for graph learning and provides
new resources for future research.

Motivation: 现有多关系图聚类方法要么结果质量不佳，要么难以处理大规模图，亟需更高效和有效的解决方案。

Method: 开发基于两阶段优化的两种算法，首先优化节点特征向量，然后通过最小化簇的Dirichlet能量实现聚类，DEMM+优化提升了可扩展性和效率。

Result: 在11个真实多关系图上，与20个基线方法比较，DEMM+在聚类质量和速度方面表现优越。

Conclusion: 提出的DEMM和DEMM+解决了多关系图大规模节点划分中的效率与质量问题，具有良好的实用性和扩展性。

Abstract: Multi-relational graphs (MRGs) are an expressive data structure for modeling
diverse interactions/relations among real objects (i.e., nodes), which pervade
extensive applications and scenarios. Given an MRG G with N nodes, partitioning
the node set therein into K disjoint clusters (MRGC) is a fundamental task in
analyzing MRGs, which has garnered considerable attention. However, the
majority of existing solutions towards MRGC either yield severely compromised
result quality by ineffective fusion of heterogeneous graph structures and
attributes, or struggle to cope with sizable MRGs with millions of nodes and
billions of edges due to the adoption of sophisticated and costly deep learning
models.
  In this paper, we present DEMM and DEMM+, two effective MRGC approaches to
address the limitations above. Specifically, our algorithms are built on novel
two-stage optimization objectives, where the former seeks to derive
high-caliber node feature vectors by optimizing the multi-relational Dirichlet
energy specialized for MRGs, while the latter minimizes the Dirichlet energy of
clustering results over the node affinity graph. In particular, DEMM+ achieves
significantly higher scalability and efficiency over our based method DEMM
through a suite of well-thought-out optimizations. Key technical contributions
include (i) a highly efficient approximation solver for constructing node
feature vectors, and (ii) a theoretically-grounded problem transformation with
carefully-crafted techniques that enable linear-time clustering without
explicitly materializing the NxN dense affinity matrix. Further, we extend
DEMM+ to handle attribute-less MRGs through non-trivial adaptations. Extensive
experiments, comparing DEMM+ against 20 baselines over 11 real MRGs, exhibit
that DEMM+ is consistently superior in terms of clustering quality measured
against ground-truth labels, while often being remarkably faster.

TL;DR: 引入互信息惊奇（MIS）框架，为自主系统提供基于学习成长的惊奇感知，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自主实验在认知控制方面受限，缺乏检测和适应意外事件的原则机制。

Method: 提出MIS，通过衡量新观测对互信息的影响，结合统计检验实现系统动态调节。

Result: 在合成和污染估计任务中，MISRP策略在稳定性、响应性和预测准确性方面优于传统方法。

Conclusion: MIS实现惊奇感从反应式向反思式转变，有助于构建更具自主性和适应性的系统。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in autonomous experimentation have demonstrated
remarkable physical capabilities, yet their cognitive control remains
limited--often relying on static heuristics or classical optimization. A core
limitation is the absence of a principled mechanism to detect and adapt to the
unexpectedness. While traditional surprise measures--such as Shannon or
Bayesian Surprise--offer momentary detection of deviation, they fail to capture
whether a system is truly learning and adapting. In this work, we introduce
Mutual Information Surprise (MIS), a new framework that redefines surprise not
as anomaly detection, but as a signal of epistemic growth. MIS quantifies the
impact of new observations on mutual information, enabling autonomous systems
to reflect on their learning progression. We develop a statistical test
sequence to detect meaningful shifts in estimated mutual information and
propose a mutual information surprise reaction policy (MISRP) that dynamically
governs system behavior through sampling adjustment and process forking.
Empirical evaluations--on both synthetic domains and a dynamic pollution map
estimation task--show that MISRP-governed strategies significantly outperform
classical surprise-based approaches in stability, responsiveness, and
predictive accuracy. By shifting surprise from reactive to reflective, MIS
offers a path toward more self-aware and adaptive autonomous systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FRAME的自动化风险评估框架，用于评估各种ML系统中的对抗学习风险，结合环境、技术和经验数据，帮助非专家识别和管理AML风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ML系统的普及，AML攻击带来的安全威胁日益增加，传统风险评估方法难以应对AML的独特挑战。

Method: 开发了FRAME框架，结合环境分析、攻击技术特征、经验研究，采用可行性打分和大规模语言模型定制，实现多系统风险评估。

Result: 在六个实际应用中验证，表现出高准确性，能为系统所有者提供有操作性的风险管理建议。

Conclusion: FRAME为多样ML系统提供了全面、自动化的AML风险评估工具，有助于推动安全AI应用。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) systems increased attention
to their security and emergence of adversarial machine learning (AML)
techniques that exploit fundamental vulnerabilities in ML systems, creating an
urgent need for comprehensive risk assessment for ML-based systems. While
traditional risk assessment frameworks evaluate conventional cybersecurity
risks, they lack ability to address unique challenges posed by AML threats.
Existing AML threat evaluation approaches focus primarily on technical attack
robustness, overlooking crucial real-world factors like deployment
environments, system dependencies, and attack feasibility. Attempts at
comprehensive AML risk assessment have been limited to domain-specific
solutions, preventing application across diverse systems. Addressing these
limitations, we present FRAME, the first comprehensive and automated framework
for assessing AML risks across diverse ML-based systems. FRAME includes a novel
risk assessment method that quantifies AML risks by systematically evaluating
three key dimensions: target system's deployment environment, characteristics
of diverse AML techniques, and empirical insights from prior research. FRAME
incorporates a feasibility scoring mechanism and LLM-based customization for
system-specific assessments. Additionally, we developed a comprehensive
structured dataset of AML attacks enabling context-aware risk assessment. From
an engineering application perspective, FRAME delivers actionable results
designed for direct use by system owners with only technical knowledge of their
systems, without expertise in AML. We validated it across six diverse
real-world applications. Our evaluation demonstrated exceptional accuracy and
strong alignment with analysis by AML experts. FRAME enables organizations to
prioritize AML risks, supporting secure AI deployment in real-world
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在改善少样本学习中的模型表现，通过增加模型表达能力来减轻欠拟合问题。

Method: 引入逆正则化策略，并设计稳定性保障措施，结合谱安全和信赖域条件，利用幂律衰减控制干预强度。

Result: AR有效减少欠拟合，提升泛化和校准能力，且干预机制简单易实现，能在资源有限环境中稳健学习。

Conclusion: 逆正则化为少样本学习提供了一个有效的调节机制，通过合理设计衰减和安全条件，确保训练的稳定性和模型的表现提升。

Abstract: We propose Anti-regularization (AR), which adds a sign-reversed reward term
to the loss to intentionally increase model expressivity in the small-sample
regime, and then attenuates this intervention with a power-law decay as the
sample size grows. We formalize spectral safety and trust-region conditions,
and design a lightweight stability safeguard that combines a projection
operator with gradient clipping, ensuring stable intervention under stated
assumptions. Our analysis spans linear smoothers and the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) regime, providing practical guidance on selecting the decay exponent by
balancing empirical risk against variance. Empirically, AR reduces underfitting
while preserving generalization and improving calibration in both regression
and classification. Ablation studies confirm that the decay schedule and the
stability safeguard are critical to preventing overfitting and numerical
instability. We further examine a degrees-of-freedom targeting schedule that
keeps per-sample complexity approximately constant. AR is simple to implement
and reproducible, integrating cleanly into standard empirical risk minimization
pipelines. It enables robust learning in data- and resource-constrained
settings by intervening only when beneficial and fading away when unnecessary.

Conclusion: MMF作为一种高效、稳定且具有普遍适用性的生成方法，有望推动一阶生成模型的发展与应用。

Abstract: One-step generative modeling seeks to generate high-quality data samples in a
single function evaluation, significantly improving efficiency over traditional
diffusion or flow-based models. In this work, we introduce Modular MeanFlow
(MMF), a flexible and theoretically grounded approach for learning
time-averaged velocity fields. Our method derives a family of loss functions
based on a differential identity linking instantaneous and average velocities,
and incorporates a gradient modulation mechanism that enables stable training
without sacrificing expressiveness. We further propose a curriculum-style
warmup schedule to smoothly transition from coarse supervision to fully
differentiable training. The MMF formulation unifies and generalizes existing
consistency-based and flow-matching methods, while avoiding expensive
higher-order derivatives. Empirical results across image synthesis and
trajectory modeling tasks demonstrate that MMF achieves competitive sample
quality, robust convergence, and strong generalization, particularly under
low-data or out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: TreePO提供了一种高效的RL后训练方案，在保持性能的同时大幅减少计算资源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning large language models via reinforcement
learning have achieved remarkable gains in solving complex reasoning problems,
but at the cost of expensive on-policy rollouts and limited exploration of
diverse reasoning paths. In this work, we introduce TreePO, involving a
self-guided rollout algorithm that views sequence generation as a
tree-structured searching process. Composed of dynamic tree sampling policy and
fixed-length segment decoding, TreePO leverages local uncertainty to warrant
additional branches. By amortizing computation across common prefixes and
pruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update
compute burden while preserving or enhancing exploration diversity. Key
contributions include: (1) a segment-wise sampling algorithm that alleviates
the KV cache burden through contiguous segments and spawns new branches along
with an early-stop mechanism; (2) a tree-based segment-level advantage
estimation that considers both global and local proximal policy optimization.
and (3) analysis on the effectiveness of probability and quality-driven dynamic
divergence and fallback strategy. We empirically validate the performance gain
of TreePO on a set reasoning benchmarks and the efficiency saving of GPU hours
from 22\% up to 43\% of the sampling design for the trained models, meanwhile
showing up to 40\% reduction at trajectory-level and 35\% at token-level
sampling compute for the existing models. While offering a free lunch of
inference efficiency, TreePO reveals a practical path toward scaling RL-based
post-training with fewer samples and less compute. Home page locates at

Result: RRPO在理论和实验证明能在模型不确定性下获得近似最优且安全的策略，优于非鲁棒方法。

Conclusion: RRPO是一种有效的鲁棒受限强化学习新方法，弥补了传统双重方法的不足。

Abstract: The goal of robust constrained reinforcement learning (RL) is to optimize an
agent's performance under the worst-case model uncertainty while satisfying
safety or resource constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that strong
duality does not generally hold in robust constrained RL, indicating that
traditional primal-dual methods may fail to find optimal feasible policies. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a novel primal-only algorithm called
Rectified Robust Policy Optimization (RRPO), which operates directly on the
primal problem without relying on dual formulations. We provide theoretical
convergence guarantees under mild regularity assumptions, showing convergence
to an approximately optimal feasible policy with iteration complexity matching
the best-known lower bound when the uncertainty set diameter is controlled in a
specific level. Empirical results in a grid-world environment validate the
effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating that RRPO achieves robust and safe
performance under model uncertainties while the non-robust method can violate
the worst-case safety constraints.

Conclusion: ReviBranch有效提升了群智能搜索中的学习效率和鲁棒性，代表了MILP求解技术的一大进步。

Abstract: The Branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm is the main solver for Mixed Integer
Linear Programs (MILPs), where the selection of branching variable is essential
to computational efficiency. However, traditional heuristics for branching
often fail to generalize across heterogeneous problem instances, while existing
learning-based methods such as imitation learning (IL) suffers from dependence
on expert demonstration quality, and reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with
limitations in sparse rewards and dynamic state representation challenges. To
address these issues, we propose ReviBranch, a novel deep RL framework that
constructs revived trajectories by reviving explicit historical correspondences
between branching decisions and their corresponding graph states along
search-tree paths. During training, ReviBranch enables agents to learn from
complete structural evolution and temporal dependencies within the branching
process. Additionally, we introduce an importance-weighted reward
redistribution mechanism that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense
stepwise feedback, addressing the sparse reward challenge. Extensive
experiments on different MILP benchmarks demonstrate that ReviBranch
outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, reducing B&B nodes by 4.0% and LP
iterations by 2.2% on large-scale instances. The results highlight the
robustness and generalizability of ReviBranch across heterogeneous MILP problem
classes.

Abstract: Adversarial examples -- inputs with imperceptible perturbations that fool
neural networks -- remain one of deep learning's most perplexing phenomena
despite nearly a decade of research. While numerous defenses and explanations
have been proposed, there is no consensus on the fundamental mechanism. One
underexplored hypothesis is that superposition, a concept from mechanistic
interpretability, may be a major contributing factor, or even the primary
cause. We present four lines of evidence in support of this hypothesis, greatly
extending prior arguments by Elhage et al. (2022): (1) superposition can
theoretically explain a range of adversarial phenomena, (2) in toy models,
intervening on superposition controls robustness, (3) in toy models,
intervening on robustness (via adversarial training) controls superposition,
and (4) in ResNet18, intervening on robustness (via adversarial training)
controls superposition.

Abstract: Predictive process monitoring enables organizations to proactively react and
intervene in running instances of a business process. Given an incomplete
process instance, predictions about the outcome, next activity, or remaining
time are created. This is done by powerful machine learning models, which have
shown impressive predictive performance. However, the data-driven nature of
these models makes them susceptible to finding unfair, biased, or unethical
patterns in the data. Such patterns lead to biased predictions based on
so-called sensitive attributes, such as the gender or age of process
participants. Previous work has identified this problem and offered solutions
that mitigate biases by removing sensitive attributes entirely from the process
instance. However, sensitive attributes can be used both fairly and unfairly in
the same process instance. For example, during a medical process, treatment
decisions could be based on gender, while the decision to accept a patient
should not be based on gender. This paper proposes a novel, model-agnostic
approach for identifying and rectifying biased decisions in predictive business
process monitoring models, even when the same sensitive attribute is used both
fairly and unfairly. The proposed approach uses a human-in-the-loop approach to
differentiate between fair and unfair decisions through simple alterations on a
decision tree model distilled from the original prediction model. Our results
show that the proposed approach achieves a promising tradeoff between fairness
and accuracy in the presence of biased data. All source code and data are

Conclusion: 关系条件的多模态学习提升了语义表达和一致性，有助于推动多模态理解的深入发展。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning has advanced rapidly with contrastive
models such as CLIP, which align image-text pairs in a shared embedding space.
However, these models face limitations: (1) they typically focus on image-text
pairs, underutilizing the semantic relations across different pairs. (2) they
directly match global embeddings without contextualization, overlooking the
need for semantic alignment along specific subspaces or relational dimensions;
and (3) they emphasize cross-modal contrast, with limited support for
intra-modal consistency. To address these issues, we propose
Relation-Conditioned Multimodal Learning RCML, a framework that learns
multimodal representations under natural-language relation descriptions to
guide both feature extraction and alignment. Our approach constructs
many-to-many training pairs linked by semantic relations and introduces a
relation-guided cross-attention mechanism that modulates multimodal
representations under each relation context. The training objective combines
inter-modal and intra-modal contrastive losses, encouraging consistency across
both modalities and semantically related samples. Experiments on different
datasets show that RCML consistently outperforms strong baselines on both
retrieval and classification tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of
leveraging semantic relations to guide multimodal representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索DLN在时间序列分类中的潜力，结合其在表格数据中的成功经验。

Method: 采用Catch22和TSFresh进行特征转换，将DLN的超参数搜索空间整合到整体优化过程中，并在51个公共数据集上进行评估。

Result: DLN在新领域中仍保持竞争力，显示出优异的准确性、低推理成本与良好的可解释性。

Conclusion: DLN适用时间序列分类，且超参数优化提升其性能，未来可拓展到更多序列分析任务中。

Abstract: Differentiable logic networks (DLNs) have shown promising results in tabular
domains by combining accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.
In this work, we apply DLNs to the domain of TSC for the first time, focusing
on univariate datasets. To enable DLN application in this context, we adopt
feature-based representations relying on Catch22 and TSFresh, converting
sequential time series into vectorized forms suitable for DLN classification.
Unlike prior DLN studies that fix the training configuration and vary various
settings in isolation via ablation, we integrate all such configurations into
the hyperparameter search space, enabling the search process to select jointly
optimal settings. We then analyze the distribution of selected configurations
to better understand DLN training dynamics. We evaluate our approach on 51
publicly available univariate TSC benchmarks. The results confirm that
classification DLNs maintain their core strengths in this new domain: they
deliver competitive accuracy, retain low inference cost, and provide
transparent, interpretable decision logic, thus aligning well with previous DLN
findings in the realm of tabular classification and regression tasks.

Result: 模型在多个数据集上表现优越，参数需求低，计算效率高，优于传统Transformer和LSTM。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效平衡预测精度与计算成本，有望推广应用于实际场景。

Abstract: Accurate univariate forecasting remains a pressing need in real-world
systems, such as energy markets, hydrology, retail demand, and IoT monitoring,
where signals are often intermittent and horizons span both short- and
long-term. While transformers and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are
increasingly favored for time-series forecasting, a key gap persists: MoE
models typically require complicated training with both the main forecasting
loss and auxiliary load-balancing losses, along with careful
routing/temperature tuning, which hinders practical adoption. In this paper, we
propose a model architecture that simplifies the training process for
univariate time series forecasting and effectively addresses both long- and
short-term horizons, including intermittent patterns. Our approach combines
sparse MoE computation with a novel attention-inspired gating mechanism that
replaces the traditional one-layer softmax router. Through extensive empirical
evaluation, we demonstrate that our gating design naturally promotes balanced
expert utilization and achieves superior predictive accuracy without requiring
the auxiliary load-balancing losses typically used in classical MoE
implementations. The model achieves better performance while utilizing only a
fraction of the parameters required by state-of-the-art transformer models,
such as PatchTST. Furthermore, experiments across diverse datasets confirm that
our MoE architecture with the proposed gating mechanism is more computationally
efficient than LSTM for both long- and short-term forecasting, enabling
cost-effective inference. These results highlight the potential of our approach
for practical time-series forecasting applications where both accuracy and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Handling missing data in time series classification remains a significant
challenge in various domains. Traditional methods often rely on imputation,
which may introduce bias or fail to capture the underlying temporal dynamics.
In this paper, we propose TANDEM (Temporal Attention-guided Neural Differential
Equations for Missingness), an attention-guided neural differential equation
framework that effectively classifies time series data with missing values. Our
approach integrates raw observation, interpolated control path, and continuous
latent dynamics through a novel attention mechanism, allowing the model to
focus on the most informative aspects of the data. We evaluate TANDEM on 30
benchmark datasets and a real-world medical dataset, demonstrating its
superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Our framework not only
improves classification accuracy but also provides insights into the handling
of missing data, making it a valuable tool in practice.

Abstract: Astronomical time series from large-scale surveys like LSST are often
irregularly sampled and incomplete, posing challenges for classification and
anomaly detection. We introduce a new framework based on Neural Stochastic
Delay Differential Equations (Neural SDDEs) that combines stochastic modeling
with neural networks to capture delayed temporal dynamics and handle irregular

numerical solver for SDDEs, and mechanisms to robustly learn from noisy, sparse
sequences. Experiments on irregularly sampled astronomical data demonstrate
strong classification accuracy and effective detection of novel astrophysical
events, even with partial labels. This work highlights Neural SDDEs as a
principled and practical tool for time series analysis under observational

Abstract: Graph homophily has been considered an essential property for message-passing
neural networks (MPNN) in node classification. Recent findings suggest that
performance is more closely tied to the consistency of neighborhood class
distributions. We demonstrate that the MPNN performance depends on the number
of components of the overall neighborhood distribution within a class. By
breaking down the classes into their neighborhood distribution components, we
increase measures of neighborhood distribution informativeness but do not
observe an improvement in MPNN performance. We propose a Gumbel-Softmax-based
rewiring method that reduces deviations in neighborhood distributions. Our
results show that our new method enhances neighborhood informativeness, handles
long-range dependencies, mitigates oversquashing, and increases the
classification performance of the MPNN. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法简便高效，有助于模型安全、调试以及理解线性传输在大模型中的作用。

Abstract: The residual stream mediates communication between transformer decoder layers
via linear reads and writes of non-linear computations. While sparse-dictionary
learning-based methods locate features in the residual stream, and activation
patching methods discover circuits within the model, the mechanism by which
features flow through the residual stream remains understudied. Understanding
this dynamic can better inform jailbreaking protections, enable early detection
of model mistakes, and their correction. In this work, we propose Activation
Transport Operators (ATO), linear maps from upstream to downstream residuals
$k$ layers later, evaluated in feature space using downstream SAE decoder
projections. We empirically demonstrate that these operators can determine
whether a feature has been linearly transported from a previous layer or
synthesised from non-linear layer computation. We develop the notion of
transport efficiency, for which we provide an upper bound, and use it to
estimate the size of the residual stream subspace that corresponds to linear
transport. We empirically demonstrate the linear transport, report transport
efficiency and the size of the residual stream's subspace involved in linear
transport. This compute-light (no finetuning, <50 GPU-h) method offers
practical tools for safety, debugging, and a clearer picture of where
computation in LLMs behaves linearly.

Conclusion: 展示了Transformer在无需训练的情况下，通过提示实现算法模拟，开启了Transformer作为可编程算法库的可能，揭示了其在模型“算法通用性”上的潜力。

Abstract: We prove that a minimal Transformer architecture with frozen weights is
capable of emulating a broad class of algorithms by in-context prompting. In
particular, for any algorithm implementable by a fixed-weight attention head
(e.g. one-step gradient descent or linear/ridge regression), there exists a
prompt that drives a two-layer softmax attention module to reproduce the
algorithm's output with arbitrary precision. This guarantee extends even to a
single-head attention layer (using longer prompts if necessary), achieving
architectural minimality. Our key idea is to construct prompts that encode an
algorithm's parameters into token representations, creating sharp dot-product
gaps that force the softmax attention to follow the intended computation. This
construction requires no feed-forward layers and no parameter updates. All
adaptation happens through the prompt alone. These findings forge a direct link
between in-context learning and algorithmic emulation, and offer a simple
mechanism for large Transformers to serve as prompt-programmable libraries of
algorithms. They illuminate how GPT-style foundation models may swap algorithms
via prompts alone, establishing a form of algorithmic universality in modern
Transformer models.

Conclusion: 该模型有效、具有扩展性，为多模态临床数据的ICU住院时间预测提供了新方案。

Abstract: Predicting a patient's length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU)
is a critical task for hospital resource management, yet remains challenging
due to the heterogeneous and irregularly sampled nature of electronic health
records (EHRs). In this work, we propose S$^2$G-Net, a novel neural
architecture that unifies state-space sequence modeling with multi-view Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) for ICU LOS prediction. The temporal path employs Mamba
state-space models (SSMs) to capture patient trajectories, while the graph path
leverages an optimized GraphGPS backbone, designed to integrate heterogeneous
patient similarity graphs derived from diagnostic, administrative, and semantic
features. Experiments on the large-scale MIMIC-IV cohort dataset show that
S$^2$G-Net consistently outperforms sequence models (BiLSTM, Mamba,
Transformer), graph models (classic GNNs, GraphGPS), and hybrid approaches
across all primary metrics. Extensive ablation studies and interpretability
analyses highlight the complementary contributions of each component of our
architecture and underscore the importance of principled graph construction.
These results demonstrate that S$^2$G-Net provides an effective and scalable
solution for ICU LOS prediction with multi-modal clinical data.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial
intelligence, fine-tuning LLMs is extraordinarily computationally expensive,
preventing smaller businesses and research teams with limited GPU resources
from engaging with new research. Hu et al and Liu et al introduce Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) and Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) as highly
efficient and performant solutions to the computational challenges of LLM
fine-tuning, demonstrating huge speedups and memory usage savings for models
such as GPT-3 and RoBERTa. We seek to expand upon the original LoRA and DoRA
papers by benchmarking efficiency and performance of LoRA and DoRA when applied
to a much smaller scale of language model: our case study here is the compact
minBERT model. Our findings reveal that optimal custom configurations of LoRA
and DoRA, coupled with Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), significantly enhance
training efficiency without compromising performance. Furthermore, while the
parameterization of minBERT is significantly smaller than GPT-3, our results
validate the observation that gradient updates to language models are
inherently low-rank even in small model space, observing that rank 1
decompositions yield negligible performance deficits. Furthermore, aided by our
highly efficient minBERT implementation, we investigate numerous architectures,
custom loss functions, and hyperparameters to ultimately train an optimal
ensembled multitask minBERT model to simultaneously perform sentiment analysis,
paraphrase detection, and similarity scoring.

Abstract: The chart-to-code generation task requires MLLMs to convert chart images into
executable code. This task faces two major challenges: limited data diversity
and insufficient maintenance of visual consistency between generated and
original charts during training. Existing datasets mainly rely on seed data to
prompt GPT models for code generation, resulting in homogeneous samples. To
address this, we propose ReChartPrompt, which leverages real-world,
human-designed charts from arXiv papers as prompts instead of synthetic seeds.
Using the diverse styles and rich content of arXiv charts, we construct
ReChartPrompt-240K, a large-scale and highly diverse dataset. Another challenge
is that although SFT effectively improve code understanding, it often fails to
ensure that generated charts are visually consistent with the originals. To
address this, we propose ChartSimRL, a GRPO-based reinforcement learning
algorithm guided by a novel chart similarity reward. This reward consists of
attribute similarity, which measures the overlap of chart attributes such as
layout and color between the generated and original charts, and visual
similarity, which assesses similarity in texture and other overall visual
features using convolutional neural networks. Unlike traditional text-based
rewards such as accuracy or format rewards, our reward considers the multimodal
nature of the chart-to-code task and effectively enhances the model's ability
to accurately reproduce charts. By integrating ReChartPrompt and ChartSimRL, we
develop the ChartMaster model, which achieves state-of-the-art results among
7B-parameter models and even rivals GPT-4o on various chart-to-code generation
benchmarks. All resources are available at

Conclusion: 将PI控制度引入SGD显著提升了模型的收敛速度和泛化能力。

Abstract: In industrial big data scenarios, high-dimensional sparse matrices (HDI) are
widely used to characterize high-order interaction relationships among massive
nodes. The stochastic gradient descent-based latent factor analysis (SGD-LFA)
method can effectively extract deep feature information embedded in HDI
matrices. However, existing SGD-LFA methods exhibit significant limitations:
their parameter update process relies solely on the instantaneous gradient
information of current samples, failing to incorporate accumulated experiential
knowledge from historical iterations or account for intrinsic correlations
between samples, resulting in slow convergence speed and suboptimal
generalization performance. Thus, this paper proposes a PILF model by
developing a PI-accelerated SGD algorithm by integrating correlated instances
and refining learning errors through proportional-integral (PI) control
mechanism that current and historical information; Comparative experiments
demonstrate the superior representation capability of the PILF model on HDI
matrices

Abstract: We propose the Quantum Graph Attention Network (QGAT), a hybrid graph neural
network that integrates variational quantum circuits into the attention
mechanism. At its core, QGAT employs strongly entangling quantum circuits with
amplitude-encoded node features to enable expressive nonlinear interactions.
Distinct from classical multi-head attention that separately computes each
head, QGAT leverages a single quantum circuit to simultaneously generate
multiple attention coefficients. This quantum parallelism facilitates parameter
sharing across heads, substantially reducing computational overhead and model
complexity. Classical projection weights and quantum circuit parameters are
optimized jointly in an end-to-end manner, ensuring flexible adaptation to
learning tasks. Empirical results demonstrate QGAT's effectiveness in capturing
complex structural dependencies and improved generalization in inductive
scenarios, highlighting its potential for scalable quantum-enhanced learning
across domains such as chemistry, biology, and network analysis. Furthermore,
experiments confirm that quantum embedding enhances robustness against feature
and structural noise, suggesting advantages in handling real-world noisy data.
The modularity of QGAT also ensures straightforward integration into existing
architectures, allowing it to easily augment classical attention-based models.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation represents a significant advancement in boosting
the performance of machine learning (ML) models, particularly in fields where
data acquisition is challenging, such as echocardiography. The acquisition and
labeling of echocardiograms (echo) for heart assessment, crucial in
point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) settings, often encounter limitations due to
the restricted number of echo views available, typically captured by operators
with varying levels of experience. This study proposes a novel approach for
enhancing clinical diagnosis accuracy by synthetically generating echo views.
These views are conditioned on existing, real views of the heart, focusing
specifically on the estimation of ejection fraction (EF), a critical parameter
traditionally measured from biplane apical views. By integrating a conditional
generative model, we demonstrate an improvement in EF estimation accuracy,
providing a comparative analysis with traditional methods. Preliminary results
indicate that our synthetic echoes, when used to augment existing datasets, not
only enhance EF estimation but also show potential in advancing the development
of more robust, accurate, and clinically relevant ML models. This approach is
anticipated to catalyze further research in synthetic data applications, paving
the way for innovative solutions in medical imaging diagnostics.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that remains
challenging to predict due to its multifactorial etiology and the complexity of
multimodal clinical data. Accurate forecasting of clinically relevant
biomarkers, including diagnostic and quantitative measures, is essential for
effective monitoring of disease progression. This work introduces L2C-TabPFN, a
method that integrates a longitudinal-to-cross-sectional (L2C) transformation
with a pre-trained Tabular Foundation Model (TabPFN) to predict Alzheimer's
disease outcomes using the TADPOLE dataset. L2C-TabPFN converts sequential
patient records into fixed-length feature vectors, enabling robust prediction
of diagnosis, cognitive scores, and ventricular volume. Experimental results
demonstrate that, while L2C-TabPFN achieves competitive performance on
diagnostic and cognitive outcomes, it provides state-of-the-art results in

Abstract: Cognitive assessments require normative data as essential benchmarks for
evaluating individual performance. Hence, developing new cognitive tests based
on novel image stimuli is challenging due to the lack of readily available
normative data. Traditional data collection methods are costly, time-consuming,
and infrequently updated, limiting their practical utility. Recent advancements
in generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a new approach to
generate synthetic normative data from existing cognitive test images. We
investigated the feasibility of using MLLMs, specifically GPT-4o and
GPT-4o-mini, to synthesize normative textual responses for established
image-based cognitive assessments, such as the "Cookie Theft" picture
description task. Two distinct prompting strategies-naive prompts with basic
instructions and advanced prompts enriched with contextual guidance-were
evaluated. Responses were analyzed using embeddings to assess their capacity to
distinguish diagnostic groups and demographic variations. Performance metrics
included BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Advanced
prompting strategies produced synthetic responses that more effectively
distinguished between diagnostic groups and captured demographic diversity
compared to naive prompts. Superior models generated responses exhibiting
higher realism and diversity. BERTScore emerged as the most reliable metric for
contextual similarity assessment, while BLEU was less effective for evaluating
creative outputs. The LLM-as-a-judge approach provided promising preliminary
validation results. Our study demonstrates that generative multimodal LLMs,
guided by refined prompting methods, can feasibly generate robust synthetic
normative data for existing cognitive tests, thereby laying the groundwork for
developing novel image-based cognitive assessments without the traditional
limitations.

TL;DR: 提出一种动态调整语言模型预训练数据比例的方法TiKMiX，基于Group Influence评估模型对不同数据域的偏好，实现优化数据混合，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态混合策略不适应训练过程中模型偏好的动态变化，亟需更高效的方法动态调整数据比例。

Method: 引入Group Influence指标，结合优化搜索和回归预测两种策略，动态调整预训练数据混合比。

Result: TiKMiX在不同规模模型训练中优于现有方法，提升下游任务性能，并降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 动态调整数据混合策略，基于模型偏好变化，显著优化预训练效果，具有推广价值。

Abstract: The data mixture used in the pre-training of a language model is a
cornerstone of its final performance. However, a static mixing strategy is
suboptimal, as the model's learning preferences for various data domains shift
dynamically throughout training. Crucially, observing these evolving
preferences in a computationally efficient manner remains a significant
challenge. To address this, we propose TiKMiX, a method that dynamically
adjusts the data mixture according to the model's evolving preferences. TiKMiX
introduces Group Influence, an efficient metric for evaluating the impact of
data domains on the model. This metric enables the formulation of the data
mixing problem as a search for an optimal, influence-maximizing distribution.
We solve this via two approaches: TiKMiX-D for direct optimization, and
TiKMiX-M, which uses a regression model to predict a superior mixture. We
trained models with different numbers of parameters, on up to 1 trillion
tokens. TiKMiX-D exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods like
REGMIX while using just 20% of the computational resources. TiKMiX-M leads to
an average performance gain of 2% across 9 downstream benchmarks. Our
experiments reveal that a model's data preferences evolve with training
progress and scale, and we demonstrate that dynamically adjusting the data
mixture based on Group Influence, a direct measure of these preferences,
significantly improves performance by mitigating the underdigestion of data
seen with static ratios.

Abstract: Mamba-based State Space Models (SSM) have emerged as a promising alternative
to the ubiquitous transformers. Despite the expressive power of transformers,
the quadratic complexity of computing attention is a major impediment to
scaling performance as we increase the sequence length. SSMs provide an
alternative path that addresses this problem, reducing the computational
complexity requirements of self-attention with novel model architectures for
different domains and fields such as video, text generation and graphs. Thus,
it is important to characterize the behavior of these emerging workloads on
GPUs and understand their requirements during GPU microarchitectural design. In
this work we evaluate Mamba-based SSMs and characterize their behavior during
training on GPUs. We construct a workload suite that offers representative
models that span different model architectures. We then use this suite to
analyze the architectural implications of running Mamba-based SSMs on GPUs. Our
work sheds new light on potential optimizations to continue scaling the
performance for such models.

Conclusion: 基于适配器的对抗训练方法是一种高效、鲁棒且适应性强的技术，有助于构建更可信赖的基础模型。

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) with projected gradient descent is the most popular
method to improve model robustness under adversarial attacks. However,
computational overheads become prohibitively large when AT is applied to large
backbone models. AT is also known to have the issue of robust overfitting. This
paper contributes to solving both problems simultaneously towards building more
trustworthy foundation models. In particular, we propose a new adapter-based
approach for efficient AT directly in the feature space. We show that the
proposed adapter-based approach can improve the inner-loop convergence quality
by eliminating robust overfitting. As a result, it significantly increases
computational efficiency and improves model accuracy by generalizing
adversarial robustness to unseen attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
the new adapter-based approach in different backbone architectures and in AT at
scale.

Result: 这是一个概念性研究，未提供具体实证结果，但提出了未来验证的框架。

Conclusion: “遗忘作为消融”是一种衡量AI在科学发现中真正创造能力的有前景的工具，可类似ImageNet推动计算机视觉的发展。

Abstract: Bold claims about AI's role in science-from "AGI will cure all diseases" to
promises of radically accelerated discovery-raise a central epistemic question:
do large language models (LLMs) truly generate new knowledge, or do they merely
remix memorized fragments? We propose unlearning-as-ablation as a falsifiable
test of constructive scientific discovery. The method systematically removes a
target result and its entire forget-closure (lemmas, paraphrases, and multi-hop
entailments) and then evaluates whether the model can re-derive the result from
only permitted axioms and tools. Success provides evidence for genuine
generative capability; failure exposes current limits. Unlike prevailing
motivations for unlearning-privacy, copyright, or safety-our framing
repositions it as an epistemic probe for AI-for-Science. We argue that such
tests could serve as the next generation of benchmarks, much as ImageNet
catalyzed progress in vision: distinguishing models that can merely recall from
those that can constructively generate new scientific knowledge. We outline a
minimal pilot in mathematics and algorithms, and discuss extensions to physics,
chemistry, and biology. Whether models succeed or fail, unlearning-as-ablation
provides a principled framework to map the true reach and limits of AI
scientific discovery. This is a position paper: we advance a conceptual and
methodological argument rather than new empirical results.

Abstract: When do diffusion models reproduce their training data, and when are they
able to generate samples beyond it? A practically relevant theoretical
understanding of this interplay between memorization and generalization may
significantly impact real-world deployments of diffusion models with respect to
issues such as copyright infringement and data privacy. In this work, to
disentangle the different factors that influence memorization and
generalization in practical diffusion models, we introduce a scientific and
mathematical "laboratory" for investigating these phenomena in diffusion models
trained on fully synthetic or natural image-like structured data. Within this
setting, we hypothesize that the memorization or generalization behavior of an
underparameterized trained model is determined by the difference in training
loss between an associated memorizing model and a generalizing model. To probe
this hypothesis, we theoretically characterize a crossover point wherein the
weighted training loss of a fully generalizing model becomes greater than that
of an underparameterized memorizing model at a critical value of model
(under)parameterization. We then demonstrate via carefully-designed experiments
that the location of this crossover predicts a phase transition in diffusion
models trained via gradient descent, validating our hypothesis. Ultimately, our
theory enables us to analytically predict the model size at which memorization
becomes predominant. Our work provides an analytically tractable and
practically meaningful setting for future theoretical and empirical
investigations. Code for our experiments is available at

Abstract: Federated learning facilitates collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy. However, its performance is often
constrained by limited communication resources, particularly in systems
supporting a large number of clients. To address this challenge, integrating
over-the-air computations into the training process has emerged as a promising
solution to alleviate communication bottlenecks. The system significantly
increases the number of clients it can support in each communication round by
transmitting intermediate parameters via analog signals rather than digital
ones. This improvement, however, comes at the cost of channel-induced
distortions, such as fading and noise, which affect the aggregated global
parameters. To elucidate these effects, this paper develops a theoretical
framework to analyze the performance of over-the-air federated learning in
large-scale client scenarios. Our analysis reveals three key advantages of
scaling up the number of participating clients: (1) Enhanced Privacy: The
mutual information between a client's local gradient and the server's
aggregated gradient diminishes, effectively reducing privacy leakage. (2)
Mitigation of Channel Fading: The channel hardening effect eliminates the
impact of small-scale fading in the noisy global gradient. (3) Improved
Convergence: Reduced thermal noise and gradient estimation errors benefit the
convergence rate. These findings solidify over-the-air model training as a
viable approach for federated learning in networks with a large number of
clients. The theoretical insights are further substantiated through extensive
experimental evaluations.

Learning with Gaussian Copula to deal with sparsity, which contains three
modules: data complementation, ML construction, and adaptive ensemble. First,
it applies Gaussian Copula to eliminate sparsity. Then, we utilise five ML
models to make predictions individually. Finally, it employs adaptive ensemble
to get final weighted-sum result. Experiments have demonstrated that our model
are robust.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) revolutionizes molecule generation in
bioengineering and biological research, significantly accelerating discovery
processes. However, this advancement introduces critical concerns regarding
intellectual property protection. To address these challenges, we propose the
first robust watermarking method designed for molecules, which utilizes
atom-level features to preserve molecular integrity and invariant features to
ensure robustness against affine transformations. Comprehensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our method using the datasets QM9 and GEOM-DRUG,
and generative models GeoBFN and GeoLDM. We demonstrate the feasibility of
embedding watermarks, maintaining basic properties higher than 90.00\% while
achieving watermark accuracy greater than 95.00\%. Furthermore, downstream
docking simulations reveal comparable performance between original and
watermarked molecules, with binding affinities reaching -6.00 kcal/mol and root
mean square deviations below 1.602 \AA. These results confirm that our

without compromising scientific utility, enabling secure and responsible AI

Abstract: Despite extensive efforts to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
values and safety rules, jailbreak attacks that exploit certain vulnerabilities
continuously emerge, highlighting the need to strengthen existing LLMs with
additional safety properties to defend against these attacks. However, tuning
large models has become increasingly resource-intensive and may have difficulty
ensuring consistent performance. We introduce Speculative Safety-Aware Decoding
(SSD), a lightweight decoding-time approach that equips LLMs with the desired
safety property while accelerating inference. We assume that there exists a
small language model that possesses this desired property. SSD integrates
speculative sampling during decoding and leverages the match ratio between the
small and composite models to quantify jailbreak risks. This enables SSD to
dynamically switch between decoding schemes to prioritize utility or safety, to
handle the challenge of different model capacities. The output token is then
sampled from a new distribution that combines the distributions of the original
and the small models. Experimental results show that SSD successfully equips
the large model with the desired safety property, and also allows the model to
remain helpful to benign queries. Furthermore, SSD accelerates the inference
time, thanks to the speculative sampling design.

Method: 在六种先进的文本编码器和二十六个任务上，系统性研究裁剪嵌入维度对性能的影响，分析了嵌入空间的分布特性。

Result: 裁剪多达50%的嵌入维度，仅导致性能下降不足10%，且删除均匀分布的维度反而提升性能，表明大量维度冗余；此现象在生成任务中亦成立。

Conclusion: 嵌入空间中许多维度非关键且冗余，裁剪可缩减模型大小，无显著损失性能，为理解与优化文本表示提供新视角。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the surprising impact that truncating text embeddings
has on downstream performance. We consistently observe across 6
state-of-the-art text encoders and 26 downstream tasks, that randomly removing
up to 50% of embedding dimensions results in only a minor drop in performance,
less than 10%, in retrieval and classification tasks. Given the benefits of
using smaller-sized embeddings, as well as the potential insights about text
encoding, we study this phenomenon and find that, contrary to what is suggested
in prior work, this is not the result of an ineffective use of representation
space. Instead, we find that a large number of uniformly distributed dimensions
actually cause an increase in performance when removed. This would explain why,
on average, removing a large number of embedding dimensions results in a
marginal drop in performance. We make similar observations when truncating the
embeddings used by large language models to make next-token predictions on
generative tasks, suggesting that this phenomenon is not isolated to
classification or retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: 引入信赖域约束的微调方法，显著提升基础模型的泛化和稳定性，为模型进一步优化提供坚实基础。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of foundation models often leads to poor
generalization, where prior capabilities deteriorate after tuning on new tasks
or domains. Inspired by trust-region policy optimization (TRPO) and proximal
policy optimization (PPO) in reinforcement learning (RL), we propose Proximal
SFT (PSFT). This fine-tuning objective incorporates the benefits of
trust-region, effectively constraining policy drift during SFT while
maintaining competitive tuning. By viewing SFT as a special case of policy
gradient methods with constant positive advantages, we derive PSFT that
stabilizes optimization and leads to generalization, while leaving room for
further optimization in subsequent post-training stages. Experiments across
mathematical and human-value domains show that PSFT matches SFT in-domain,
outperforms it in out-of-domain generalization, remains stable under prolonged
training without causing entropy collapse, and provides a stronger foundation
for the subsequent optimization.

Abstract: This paper introduces MANGO (Multilayer Abstraction for Nested Generation of
Options), a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework designed to
address the challenges of long-term sparse reward environments. MANGO
decomposes complex tasks into multiple layers of abstraction, where each layer
defines an abstract state space and employs options to modularize trajectories
into macro-actions. These options are nested across layers, allowing for
efficient reuse of learned movements and improved sample efficiency. The
framework introduces intra-layer policies that guide the agent's transitions
within the abstract state space, and task actions that integrate task-specific
components such as reward functions. Experiments conducted in
procedurally-generated grid environments demonstrate substantial improvements
in both sample efficiency and generalization capabilities compared to standard
RL methods. MANGO also enhances interpretability by making the agent's
decision-making process transparent across layers, which is particularly
valuable in safety-critical and industrial applications. Future work will
explore automated discovery of abstractions and abstract actions, adaptation to
continuous or fuzzy environments, and more robust multi-layer training
strategies.

Conclusion: 当前的softmax注意力机制存在性能瓶颈，亟需探索更稳健的归一化和选择策略。

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention
mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the
identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation
involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances
and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through
experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our
theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism.
Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the
model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging
toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity
under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at
low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of
softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust
normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in generative
tasks (e.g., image and video generation), and the demand for high-quality
content (e.g., 2K/4K videos) is rapidly increasing across various domains.
However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing
standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the
excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and
memory costs. To this end, we introduce SuperGen, an efficient tile-based
framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SuperGen features a novel
training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide
range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly
reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SuperGen
incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that
accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps
and spatial regions. SuperGen also integrates cache-guided,
communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized
latency. Evaluations demonstrate that SuperGen harvests the maximum performance
gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) are powerful models for node
classification but suffer from performance limitations under heterophily (low
same-class connectivity) and structural bottlenecks in the graph. We provide a
unifying statistical framework exposing the relationship between heterophily
and bottlenecks through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MPNN
representations. The SNR decomposes model performance into feature-dependent
parameters and feature-independent sensitivities. We prove that the sensitivity
to class-wise signals is bounded by higher-order homophily -- a generalisation
of classical homophily to multi-hop neighbourhoods -- and show that low
higher-order homophily manifests locally as the interaction between structural
bottlenecks and class labels (class-bottlenecks). Through analysis of graph
ensembles, we provide a further quantitative decomposition of bottlenecking
into underreaching (lack of depth implying signals cannot arrive) and
oversquashing (lack of breadth implying signals arriving on fewer paths) with
closed-form expressions. We prove that optimal graph structures for maximising
higher-order homophily are disjoint unions of single-class and
two-class-bipartite clusters. This yields BRIDGE, a graph ensemble-based
rewiring algorithm that achieves near-perfect classification accuracy across
all homophily regimes on synthetic benchmarks and significant improvements on
real-world benchmarks, by eliminating the ``mid-homophily pitfall'' where MPNNs
typically struggle, surpassing current standard rewiring techniques from the
literature. Our framework, whose code we make available for public use,
provides both diagnostic tools for assessing MPNN performance, and simple yet
effective methods for enhancing performance through principled graph
modification.

Result: 发现许多指标评价结果冲突，ENE和CWC表现最为可靠。

Conclusion: 指标选择在校准研究中至关重要，应谨慎依据可靠指标评估模型校准效果。

Abstract: In safety-critical applications data-driven models must not only be accurate
but also provide reliable uncertainty estimates. This property, commonly
referred to as calibration, is essential for risk-aware decision-making. In
regression a wide variety of calibration metrics and recalibration methods have
emerged. However, these metrics differ significantly in their definitions,
assumptions and scales, making it difficult to interpret and compare results
across studies. Moreover, most recalibration methods have been evaluated using
only a small subset of metrics, leaving it unclear whether improvements
generalize across different notions of calibration. In this work, we
systematically extract and categorize regression calibration metrics from the
literature and benchmark these metrics independently of specific modelling
methods or recalibration approaches. Through controlled experiments with
real-world, synthetic and artificially miscalibrated data, we demonstrate that
calibration metrics frequently produce conflicting results. Our analysis
reveals substantial inconsistencies: many metrics disagree in their evaluation
of the same recalibration result, and some even indicate contradictory
conclusions. This inconsistency is particularly concerning as it potentially
allows cherry-picking of metrics to create misleading impressions of success.
We identify the Expected Normalized Calibration Error (ENCE) and the Coverage
Width-based Criterion (CWC) as the most dependable metrics in our tests. Our
findings highlight the critical role of metric selection in calibration
research.

Motivation: 随着单中心计算受限，分散式训练变得关键，但异质环境中存在采样学习耦合问题，亟需更稳健的强化学习方法。

Method: 引入异步架构HeteroRL，将采样与参数更新解耦，提出GEPO以降低重要性采样的方差。

Result: 在网络延迟达1800秒的情况下，方法表现出超越传统算法的稳定性，性能损失小于3%，展现出在异构网络中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: HeteroRL结合GEPO，有效应对分布式环境中的延迟和异质性问题，为大规模语言模型的去中心化强化学习提供新思路。

Abstract: As single-center computing approaches power constraints, decentralized
training is becoming essential. Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training
enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) but faces challenges in heterogeneous
distributed environments due to its tightly-coupled sampling-learning
alternation. We propose HeteroRL, an asynchronous RL architecture that
decouples rollout sampling from parameter learning, enabling robust deployment
across geographically distributed nodes under network delays. We identify that
latency-induced KL divergence causes importance sampling failure due to high
variance. To address this, we propose Group Expectation Policy Optimization
(GEPO), which reduces importance weight variance through a refined sampling
mechanism. Theoretically, GEPO achieves exponential variance reduction.
Experiments show it maintains superior stability over methods like GRPO, with
less than 3% performance degradation under 1800-second delays, demonstrating
strong potential for decentralized RL in heterogeneous networks.

Conclusion: 提出的调度方法有效应对异构硬件环境下的多模型调度挑战，显著提升性能和实用性。

Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed on mobile devices, modern
mobile devices incorporate deep learning-specific accelerators to handle the
growing computational demands, thus increasing their hardware heterogeneity.
However, existing works on scheduling deep learning workloads across these
processors have significant limitations: most studies focus on single-model
scenarios rather than realistic multi-model scenarios, overlook performance
variations from different hardware/software configurations, and struggle with
accurate execution time estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel genetic algorithm-based methodology for scheduling multiple deep learning
networks on heterogeneous processors by partitioning the networks into multiple
subgraphs. Our approach incorporates three different types of chromosomes for
partition/mapping/priority exploration, and leverages device-in-the-loop
profiling and evaluation for accurate execution time estimation. Based on this
methodology, our system, Puzzle, demonstrates superior performance in extensive
evaluations with randomly generated scenarios involving nine state-of-the-art
networks. The results demonstrate Puzzle can support 3.7 and 2.2 times higher
request frequency on average compared to the two heuristic baselines, NPU Only
and Best Mapping, respectively, while satisfying the equivalent level of
real-time requirements.

Abstract: Accurate air quality prediction is becoming increasingly important in the
environmental field. To address issues such as low prediction accuracy and slow
real-time updates in existing models, which lead to lagging prediction results,
we propose a Transformer-based spatiotemporal data prediction method
(Ada-TransGNN) that integrates global spatial semantics and temporal behavior.
The model constructs an efficient and collaborative spatiotemporal block set
comprising a multi-head attention mechanism and a graph convolutional network
to extract dynamically changing spatiotemporal dependency features from complex
air quality monitoring data. Considering the interaction relationships between
different monitoring points, we propose an adaptive graph structure learning
module, which combines spatiotemporal dependency features in a data-driven
manner to learn the optimal graph structure, thereby more accurately capturing
the spatial relationships between monitoring points. Additionally, we design an
auxiliary task learning module that enhances the decoding capability of
temporal relationships by integrating spatial context information into the
optimal graph structure representation, effectively improving the accuracy of
prediction results. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on a benchmark
dataset and a novel dataset (Mete-air). The results demonstrate that our model
outperforms existing state-of-the-art prediction models in short-term and
long-term predictions.

Result: 该几何优化方法显著优于传统AdamW，提升模型在多个基准测试中的表现。

Conclusion: 几何约束优化是充分发挥LoRA在LLM微调中的潜力的关键，有助于实现高效且性能优越的模型微调。

Abstract: While powerful, large language models (LLMs) present significant fine-tuning
challenges due to their size. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods
like LoRA provide solutions, yet suffer from critical optimizer inefficiencies;
notably basis redundancy in LoRA's $B$ matrix when using AdamW, which
fundamentally limits performance. We address this by optimizing the $B$ matrix
on the Stiefel manifold, imposing explicit orthogonality constraints that
achieve near-perfect orthogonality and full effective rank. This geometric
approach dramatically enhances parameter efficiency and representational
capacity. Our Stiefel optimizer consistently outperforms AdamW across
benchmarks with both LoRA and DoRA, demonstrating that geometric constraints
are the key to unlocking LoRA's full potential for effective LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Autonomous planetary exploration missions are critically dependent on
real-time, accurate environmental perception for navigation and hazard
avoidance. However, deploying deep learning models on the resource-constrained
computational hardware of planetary exploration platforms remains a significant
challenge. This paper introduces the Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater
Detection System (AQ-PCDSys), a novel framework specifically engineered for
real-time, onboard deployment in the computationally constrained environments
of space exploration missions. AQ-PCDSys synergistically integrates a Quantized
Neural Network (QNN) architecture, trained using Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT), with an Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion (AMF) module. The QNN architecture
significantly optimizes model size and inference latency suitable for real-time
onboard deployment in space exploration missions, while preserving high
accuracy. The AMF module intelligently fuses data from Optical Imagery (OI) and
Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at the feature level, utilizing an Adaptive
Weighting Mechanism (AWM) to dynamically prioritize the most relevant and
reliable sensor modality based on planetary ambient conditions. This approach
enhances detection robustness across diverse planetary landscapes. Paired with
Multi-Scale Detection Heads specifically designed for robust and efficient
detection of craters across a wide range of sizes, AQ-PCDSys provides a
computationally efficient, reliable and accurate solution for planetary crater
detection, a critical capability for enabling the next generation of autonomous
planetary landing, navigation, and scientific exploration.

Abstract: Accurate spectrum prediction is crucial for dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and
resource allocation. However, due to the unique characteristics of spectrum
data, existing methods based on the time or frequency domain often struggle to
separate predictable patterns from noise. To address this, we propose the
Spectral Fractional Filtering and Prediction (SFFP) framework. SFFP first
employs an adaptive fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) module to transform
spectrum data into a suitable fractional Fourier domain, enhancing the
separability of predictable trends from noise. Subsequently, an adaptive Filter
module selectively suppresses noise while preserving critical predictive
features within this domain. Finally, a prediction module, leveraging a
complex-valued neural network, learns and forecasts these filtered trend
components. Experiments on real-world spectrum data show that the SFFP
outperforms leading spectrum and general forecasting methods.

Abstract: Recently, detection of label errors and improvement of label quality in
datasets for supervised learning tasks has become an increasingly important
goal in both research and industry. The consequences of incorrectly annotated
data include reduced model performance, biased benchmark results, and lower
overall accuracy. Current state-of-the-art label error detection methods often
focus on a single computer vision task and, consequently, a specific type of
dataset, containing, for example, either bounding boxes or pixel-wise
annotations. Furthermore, previous methods are not learning-based. In this
work, we overcome this research gap. We present a unified method for detecting
label errors in object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance
segmentation datasets. In a nutshell, our approach - learning to detect label
errors by making them - works as follows: we inject different kinds of label
errors into the ground truth. Then, the detection of label errors, across all
mentioned primary tasks, is framed as an instance segmentation problem based on
a composite input. In our experiments, we compare the label error detection
performance of our method with various baselines and state-of-the-art
approaches of each task's domain on simulated label errors across multiple
tasks, datasets, and base models. This is complemented by a generalization
study on real-world label errors. Additionally, we release 459 real label
errors identified in the Cityscapes dataset and provide a benchmark for real
label error detection in Cityscapes.

Abstract: Efficient equilibrium sampling of molecular conformations remains a core
challenge in computational chemistry and statistical inference. Classical
approaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently
lack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in-full for
each system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has
inspired interest into overcoming this limitation through learning sampling
algorithms. Despite performing on par with conventional methods when trained on
a single system, learned samplers have so far demonstrated limited ability to
transfer across systems. We prove that deep learning enables the design of
scalable and transferable samplers by introducing Prose, a 280 million
parameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide
molecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Prose draws
zero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems,
achieving the previously intractable transferability across sequence length,
whilst retaining the efficient likelihood evaluation of normalizing flows.
Through extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate the efficacy of Prose as
a proposal for a variety of sampling algorithms, finding a simple importance
sampling-based finetuning procedure to achieve superior performance to
established methods such as sequential Monte Carlo on unseen tetrapeptides. We
open-source the Prose codebase, model weights, and training dataset, to further
stimulate research into amortized sampling methods and finetuning objectives.

Conclusion: FedMate通过双边优化机制，有效解决数据异质性问题，推动联邦学习向更真实应用场景的方向发展。

Abstract: Cross-client data heterogeneity in federated learning induces biases that
impede unbiased consensus condensation and the complementary fusion of
generalization- and personalization-oriented knowledge. While existing
approaches mitigate heterogeneity through model decoupling and representation
center loss, they often rely on static and restricted metrics to evaluate local
knowledge and adopt global alignment too rigidly, leading to consensus
distortion and diminished model adaptability. To address these limitations, we
propose FedMate, a method that implements bilateral optimization: On the server
side, we construct a dynamic global prototype, with aggregation weights
calibrated by holistic integration of sample size, current parameters, and
future prediction; a category-wise classifier is then fine-tuned using this
prototype to preserve global consistency. On the client side, we introduce
complementary classification fusion to enable merit-based discrimination
training and incorporate cost-aware feature transmission to balance model
performance and communication efficiency. Experiments on five datasets of
varying complexity demonstrate that FedMate outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in harmonizing generalization and adaptation. Additionally, semantic
segmentation experiments on autonomous driving datasets validate the method's
real-world scalability.

Abstract: Scaling distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires not
only algorithmic advances but also efficient utilization of heterogeneous
hardware resources. While existing methods such as DiLoCo have demonstrated
promising results, they often fail to fully exploit computational clusters
under dynamic workloads. To address this limitation, we propose a three-stage
method that combines Multi-Instance Training (MIT), Adaptive Batched DiLoCo,
and switch mode mechanism. MIT allows individual nodes to run multiple
lightweight training streams with different model instances in parallel and
merge them to combine knowledge, increasing throughput and reducing idle time.
Adaptive Batched DiLoCo dynamically adjusts local batch sizes to balance
computation and communication, substantially lowering synchronization delays.
Switch mode further stabilizes training by seamlessly introducing gradient
accumulation once adaptive batch sizes grow beyond hardware-friendly limits.
Together, these innovations improve both convergence speed and system
efficiency. We also provide a theoretical estimate of the number of
communications required for the full convergence of a model trained using our
method.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
achieving unprecedented communication efficiency in sixth-generation (6G)
networks by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to extract and transmit the
underlying meanings of source data. However, deploying SemCom over digital
systems presents new challenges, particularly in ensuring robustness against
transmission errors that may distort semantically critical content. To address
this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework, termed generative feature
imputing, which comprises three key techniques. First, we introduce a spatial
error concentration packetization strategy that spatially concentrates feature
distortions by encoding feature elements based on their channel mappings, a
property crucial for both the effectiveness and reduced complexity of the
subsequent techniques. Second, building on this strategy, we propose a
generative feature imputing method that utilizes a diffusion model to
efficiently reconstruct missing features caused by packet losses. Finally, we
develop a semantic-aware power allocation scheme that enables unequal error
protection by allocating transmission power according to the semantic
importance of each packet. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
framework outperforms conventional approaches, such as Deep Joint
Source-Channel Coding (DJSCC) and JPEG2000, under block fading conditions,
achieving higher semantic accuracy and lower Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS) scores.

Conclusion: 提出的神经插值方法具有高效、准确、拓扑感知优势，为时间变化标量场的插值提供了新途径。

Abstract: This paper presents a neural scheme for the topology-aware interpolation of
time-varying scalar fields. Given a time-varying sequence of persistence
diagrams, along with a sparse temporal sampling of the corresponding scalar
fields, denoted as keyframes, our interpolation approach aims at "inverting"
the non-keyframe diagrams to produce plausible estimations of the
corresponding, missing data. For this, we rely on a neural architecture which
learns the relation from a time value to the corresponding scalar field, based
on the keyframe examples, and reliably extends this relation to the
non-keyframe time steps. We show how augmenting this architecture with specific
topological losses exploiting the input diagrams both improves the geometrical
and topological reconstruction of the non-keyframe time steps. At query time,
given an input time value for which an interpolation is desired, our approach
instantaneously produces an output, via a single propagation of the time input
through the network. Experiments interpolating 2D and 3D time-varying datasets
show our approach superiority, both in terms of data and topological fitting,
with regard to reference interpolation schemes.

Abstract: In this PhD thesis, we propose a novel framework for uncertainty
quantification in machine learning, which is based on proper scores.
Uncertainty quantification is an important cornerstone for trustworthy and
reliable machine learning applications in practice. Usually, approaches to
uncertainty quantification are problem-specific, and solutions and insights
cannot be readily transferred from one task to another. Proper scores are loss
functions minimized by predicting the target distribution. Due to their very
general definition, proper scores apply to regression, classification, or even
generative modeling tasks. We contribute several theoretical results, that
connect epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, and model calibration
with proper scores, resulting in a general and widely applicable framework. We
achieve this by introducing a general bias-variance decomposition for strictly
proper scores via functional Bregman divergences. Specifically, we use the
kernel score, a kernel-based proper score, for evaluating sample-based
generative models in various domains, like image, audio, and natural language
generation. This includes a novel approach for uncertainty estimation of large
language models, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further, we
generalize the calibration-sharpness decomposition beyond classification, which
motivates the definition of proper calibration errors. We then introduce a
novel estimator for proper calibration errors in classification, and a novel
risk-based approach to compare different estimators for squared calibration
errors. Last, we offer a decomposition of the kernel spherical score, another
kernel-based proper score, allowing a more fine-grained and interpretable
evaluation of generative image models.

Motivation: 解决IoT网络中存在离群点时，距离矩阵难以准确恢复的问题。

Method: 通过将距离矩阵表示为传感器坐标矩阵的函数，利用深度神经网络联合恢复距离矩阵和坐标，结合稀疏模型处理离群点，交替优化。

Result: 实验显示该方法在存在离群点的情况下，仍能准确恢复传感器位置。

Conclusion: 该方法结合深度学习与矩阵补全，有效增强了在异常环境中的网络定位性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep learning and matrix completion aided
approach for recovering an outlier contaminated Euclidean distance matrix D in
IoT network localization. Unlike conventional localization techniques that
search the solution over a whole set of matrices, the proposed technique
restricts the search to the set of Euclidean distance matrices. Specifically,
we express D as a function of the sensor coordinate matrix X that inherently
satisfies the unique properties of D, and then jointly recover D and X using a
deep neural network. To handle outliers effectively, we model them as a sparse
matrix L and add a regularization term of L into the optimization problem. We
then solve the problem by alternately updating X, D, and L. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique can recover the location
information of sensors accurately even in the presence of outliers.

Conclusion: 分析结果有助于理解不同对抗训练技术中核心元素的作用，为开发更有效的防御策略提供理论基础。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown substantial success in various
applications but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This study aims to
identify and isolate the components of two different adversarial training
techniques that contribute most to increased adversarial robustness,
particularly through the lens of margins in the input space -- the minimal
distance between data points and decision boundaries. Specifically, we compare
two methods that maximize margins: a simple approach which modifies the loss
function to increase an approximation of the margin, and a more complex
state-of-the-art method (Dynamics-Aware Robust Training) which builds upon this
approach. Using a VGG-16 model as our base, we systematically isolate and
evaluate individual components from these methods to determine their relative
impact on adversarial robustness. We assess the effect of each component on the
model's performance under various adversarial attacks, including AutoAttack and
Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). Our analysis on the CIFAR-10 dataset reveals
which elements most effectively enhance adversarial robustness, providing
insights for designing more robust DNNs.

Result: 显著超越现有提示优化方法，在结构化任务中表现优异，比如提升MGSM-SymPy任务准确率从57.1%到75.9%。

Conclusion: TACs提供了一个稳健、理论基础扎实的框架，以开发可靠且合规的LLM系统。

Abstract: Reliably composing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex, multi-step
workflows remains a significant challenge. The dominant paradigm-optimizing
discrete prompts in a pipeline-is notoriously brittle and struggles to enforce
the formal compliance required for structured tasks. We introduce
Type-Compliant Adaptation Cascades (TACs), a framework that recasts workflow
adaptation as learning typed probabilistic programs. TACs treats the entire
workflow, which is composed of parameter-efficiently adapted LLMs and
deterministic logic, as an unnormalized joint distribution. This enables
principled, gradient-based training even with latent intermediate structures.
We provide theoretical justification for our tractable optimization objective,
proving that the optimization bias vanishes as the model learns type
compliance. Empirically, TACs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
prompt-optimization baselines. Gains are particularly pronounced on structured
tasks, improving MGSM-SymPy from $57.1\%$ to $75.9\%$ for a 27B model, MGSM
from $1.6\%$ to $27.3\%$ for a 7B model. TACs offers a robust and theoretically
grounded paradigm for developing reliable, task-compliant LLM systems.

Conclusion: 利用公共信息提高差分隐私估计的准确性和鲁棒性，为差分隐私数据分析提供新途径。

Abstract: Leveraging information from public data has become increasingly crucial in
enhancing the utility of differentially private (DP) methods. Traditional DP
approaches often require adding noise based solely on private data, which can
significantly degrade utility. In this paper, we address this limitation in the
context of the ordinary least squares estimator (OLSE) of linear regression
based on sufficient statistics perturbation (SSP) under the unbounded data
assumption. We propose a novel method that involves transforming private data
using the public second-moment matrix to compute a transformed SSP-OLSE, whose
second-moment matrix yields a better condition number and improves the OLSE
accuracy and robustness. We derive theoretical error bounds about our method
and the standard SSP-OLSE to the non-DP OLSE, which reveal the improved
robustness and accuracy achieved by our approach. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: Ano优化器通过分离方向和幅值，提升鲁棒性，适应噪声环境，具有理论保证和实际效果。

Abstract: Stochastic optimizers are central to deep learning, yet widely used methods
such as Adam and Adan can degrade in non-stationary or noisy environments,
partly due to their reliance on momentum-based magnitude estimates. We
introduce Ano, a novel optimizer that decouples direction and magnitude:
momentum is used for directional smoothing, while instantaneous gradient
magnitudes determine step size. This design improves robustness to gradient
noise while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of first-order methods. We
further propose Anolog, which removes sensitivity to the momentum coefficient
by expanding its window over time via a logarithmic schedule. We establish
non-convex convergence guarantees with a convergence rate similar to other
sign-based methods, and empirically show that Ano provides substantial gains in
noisy and non-stationary regimes such as reinforcement learning, while
remaining competitive on low-noise tasks such as standard computer vision
benchmarks.

Abstract: Non-parametric change-point detection in streaming time series data is a
long-standing challenge in signal processing. Recent advancements in statistics
and machine learning have increasingly addressed this problem for data residing
on Riemannian manifolds. One prominent strategy involves monitoring abrupt
changes in the center of mass of the time series. Implemented in a streaming
fashion, this strategy, however, requires careful step size tuning when
computing the updates of the center of mass. In this paper, we propose to
leverage robust centroid on manifolds from M-estimation theory to address this
issue. Our proposal consists of comparing two centroid estimates: the classical
Karcher mean (sensitive to change) versus one defined from Huber's function
(robust to change). This comparison leads to the definition of a test statistic
whose performance is less sensitive to the underlying estimation method. We
propose a stochastic Riemannian optimization algorithm to estimate both robust
centroids efficiently. Experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world
data across two representative manifolds demonstrate the superior performance
of our proposed method.

Abstract: Simulating physics using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is predominantly driven
by message-passing architectures, which face challenges in scaling and
efficiency, particularly in handling large, complex meshes. These architectures
have inspired numerous enhancements, including multigrid approaches and $K$-hop
aggregation (using neighbours of distance $K$), yet they often introduce
significant complexity and suffer from limited in-depth investigations. In
response to these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Transformer architecture
that leverages the adjacency matrix as an attention mask. The proposed approach
incorporates innovative augmentations, including Dilated Sliding Windows and
Global Attention, to extend receptive fields without sacrificing computational
efficiency. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate model size,
adjacency matrix augmentations, positional encoding and $K$-hop configurations
using challenging 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. We also train
over 60 models to find a scaling law between training FLOPs and parameters. The
introduced models demonstrate remarkable scalability, performing on meshes with
up to 300k nodes and 3 million edges. Notably, the smallest model achieves
parity with MeshGraphNet while being $7\times$ faster and $6\times$ smaller.
The largest model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by $38.8$\% on
average and outperforms MeshGraphNet by $52$\% on the all-rollout RMSE, while
having a similar training speed. Code and datasets are available at

Result: 提出的CGNN保持区分能力和近似能力，提供了实用的架构设计准则，适用于异步、断裂的动态图。

Conclusion: 本研究成功推广动态图神经网络理论到连续时间异步场景，增强了模型的表达力和实用性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are known to match the distinguishing power of
the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test, and the resulting partitions coincide with
the unfolding tree equivalence classes of graphs. Preserving this equivalence,
GNNs can universally approximate any target function on graphs in probability
up to any precision. However, these results are limited to attributed
discrete-dynamic graphs represented as sequences of connected graph snapshots.
Real-world systems, such as communication networks, financial transaction
networks, and molecular interactions, evolve asynchronously and may split into
disconnected components. In this paper, we extend the theory of attributed
discrete-dynamic graphs to attributed continuous-time dynamic graphs with
arbitrary connectivity. To this end, we introduce a continuous-time dynamic
1-WL test, prove its equivalence to continuous-time dynamic unfolding trees,
and identify a class of continuous-time dynamic GNNs (CGNNs) based on
discrete-dynamic GNN architectures that retain both distinguishing power and
universal approximation guarantees. Our constructive proofs further yield
practical design guidelines, emphasizing a compact and expressive CGNN
architecture with piece-wise continuously differentiable temporal functions to
process asynchronous, disconnected graphs.

Conclusion: FedGreed提供了一种在对抗环境中稳定、有效的联邦学习聚合方案，有望在实际应用中提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy by keeping local datasets on-device. In
this work, we address FL settings where clients may behave adversarially,
exhibiting Byzantine attacks, while the central server is trusted and equipped
with a reference dataset. We propose FedGreed, a resilient aggregation strategy
for federated learning that does not require any assumptions about the fraction
of adversarial participants. FedGreed orders clients' local model updates based
on their loss metrics evaluated against a trusted dataset on the server and
greedily selects a subset of clients whose models exhibit the minimal
evaluation loss. Unlike many existing approaches, our method is designed to
operate reliably under heterogeneous (non-IID) data distributions, which are
prevalent in real-world deployments. FedGreed exhibits convergence guarantees
and bounded optimality gaps under strong adversarial behavior. Experimental
evaluations on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms standard and robust federated learning baselines,
such as Mean, Trimmed Mean, Median, Krum, and Multi-Krum, in the majority of
adversarial scenarios considered, including label flipping and Gaussian noise
injection attacks. All experiments were conducted using the Flower federated
learning framework.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了零日GNSS欺骗攻击的检测能力，可广泛应用于静态接收机，有助保障PNT系统安全。

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are critical for Positioning,
Navigation, and Timing (PNT) applications. However, GNSS are highly vulnerable
to spoofing attacks, where adversaries transmit counterfeit signals to mislead
receivers. Such attacks can lead to severe consequences, including misdirected
navigation, compromised data integrity, and operational disruptions. Most
existing spoofing detection methods depend on supervised learning techniques
and struggle to detect novel, evolved, and unseen attacks. To overcome this
limitation, we develop a zero-day spoofing detection method using a Hybrid
Quantum-Classical Autoencoder (HQC-AE), trained solely on authentic GNSS
signals without exposure to spoofed data. By leveraging features extracted
during the tracking stage, our method enables proactive detection before PNT
solutions are computed. We focus on spoofing detection in static GNSS
receivers, which are particularly susceptible to time-push spoofing attacks,
where attackers manipulate timing information to induce incorrect time
computations at the receiver. We evaluate our model against different unseen
time-push spoofing attack scenarios: simplistic, intermediate, and
sophisticated. Our analysis demonstrates that the HQC-AE consistently
outperforms its classical counterpart, traditional supervised learning-based
models, and existing unsupervised learning-based methods in detecting zero-day,
unseen GNSS time-push spoofing attacks, achieving an average detection accuracy
of 97.71% with an average false negative rate of 0.62% (when an attack occurs
but is not detected). For sophisticated spoofing attacks, the HQC-AE attains an
accuracy of 98.23% with a false negative rate of 1.85%. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of our method in proactively detecting zero-day
GNSS time-push spoofing attacks across various stationary GNSS receiver
platforms.

Abstract: We study Bayesian inverse problems with mixed noise, modeled as a combination
of additive and multiplicative Gaussian components. While traditional inference
methods often assume fixed or known noise characteristics, real-world
applications, particularly in physics and chemistry, frequently involve noise
with unknown and heterogeneous structure. Motivated by recent advances in
flow-based generative modeling, we propose a novel inference framework based on
conditional flow matching embedded within an Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm to jointly estimate posterior samplers and noise parameters. To
enable high-dimensional inference and improve scalability, we use
simulation-free ODE-based flow matching as the generative model in the E-step
of the EM algorithm. We prove that, under suitable assumptions, the EM updates
converge to the true noise parameters in the population limit of infinite
observations. Our numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of combining
EM inference with flow matching for mixed-noise Bayesian inverse problems.

Result: 在七个长时间序列预测基准上，FreezeTST表现优异，效果优于或等同于专门设计的模型，同时计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 在Transformer中引入储层原理是一种简洁有效的长序列预测优化方案。

Abstract: Transformers are the de-facto choice for sequence modelling, yet their
quadratic self-attention and weak temporal bias can make long-range forecasting
both expensive and brittle. We introduce FreezeTST, a lightweight hybrid that
interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable
Transformer layers. The frozen blocks endow the network with rich nonlinear
memory at no optimisation cost; the trainable layers learn to query this memory
through self-attention. The design cuts trainable parameters and also lowers
wall-clock training time, while leaving inference complexity unchanged. On
seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches
or surpasses specialised variants such as Informer, Autoformer, and PatchTST;
with substantially lower compute. Our results show that embedding reservoir
principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient
long-term time-series prediction.

Abstract: The ``black-box'' nature of deep learning models presents a significant
barrier to their adoption for scientific discovery, where interpretability is
paramount. This challenge is especially pronounced in discovering the governing
equations of dynamical processes on networks or graphs, since even their
topological structure further affects the processes' behavior. This paper
provides a rigorous, comparative assessment of state-of-the-art symbolic
regression techniques for this task. We evaluate established methods, including
sparse regression and MLP-based architectures, and introduce a novel adaptation
of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for graphs, designed to exploit their
inherent interpretability. Across a suite of synthetic and real-world dynamical
systems, our results demonstrate that both MLP and KAN-based architectures can
successfully identify the underlying symbolic equations, significantly
surpassing existing baselines. Critically, we show that KANs achieve this
performance with greater parsimony and transparency, as their learnable
activation functions provide a clearer mapping to the true physical dynamics.
This study offers a practical guide for researchers, clarifying the trade-offs
between model expressivity and interpretability, and establishes the viability
of neural-based architectures for robust scientific discovery on complex
systems.

Abstract: Forecasting chaotic dynamics beyond a few Lyapunov times is difficult because
infinitesimal errors grow exponentially. Existing Echo State Networks (ESNs)
mitigate this growth but employ reservoirs whose Euclidean geometry is
mismatched to the stretch-and-fold structure of chaos. We introduce the
Hyperbolic Embedding Reservoir (HypER), an ESN whose neurons are sampled in the
Poincare ball and whose connections decay exponentially with hyperbolic
distance. This negative-curvature construction embeds an exponential metric
directly into the latent space, aligning the reservoir's local
expansion-contraction spectrum with the system's Lyapunov directions while
preserving standard ESN features such as sparsity, leaky integration, and
spectral-radius control. Training is limited to a Tikhonov-regularized readout.
On the chaotic Lorenz-63 and Roessler systems, and the hyperchaotic Chen-Ueta
attractor, HypER consistently lengthens the mean valid-prediction horizon
beyond Euclidean and graph-structured ESN baselines, with statistically
significant gains confirmed over 30 independent runs; parallel results on
real-world benchmarks, including heart-rate variability from the Santa Fe and
MIT-BIH datasets and international sunspot numbers, corroborate its advantage.
We further establish a lower bound on the rate of state divergence for HypER,
mirroring Lyapunov growth.

Abstract: Every prediction is ultimately used in a downstream task. Consequently,
evaluating prediction quality is more meaningful when considered in the context
of its downstream use. Metrics based solely on predictive performance often
diverge from measures of real-world downstream impact. Existing approaches
incorporate the downstream view by relying on multiple task-specific metrics,
which can be burdensome to analyze, or by formulating cost-sensitive
evaluations that require an explicit cost structure, typically assumed to be
known a priori. We frame this mismatch as an evaluation alignment problem and
propose a data-driven method to learn a proxy evaluation function aligned with
the downstream evaluation. Building on the theory of proper scoring rules, we
explore transformations of scoring rules that ensure the preservation of
propriety. Our approach leverages weighted scoring rules parametrized by a
neural network, where weighting is learned to align with the performance in the
downstream task. This enables fast and scalable evaluation cycles across tasks
where the weighting is complex or unknown a priori. We showcase our framework
through synthetic and real-data experiments for regression tasks, demonstrating
its potential to bridge the gap between predictive evaluation and downstream
utility in modular prediction systems.
