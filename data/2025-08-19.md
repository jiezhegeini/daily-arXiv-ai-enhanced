### [1] [Deep Language Geometry: Constructing a Metric Space from LLM Weights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11676)
*Maksym Shamrai,Vladyslav Hamolia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种利用大语言模型内部权重激活构建语言度量空间的新方法，自动生成高维向量刻画语言特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补传统基于手工特征的方法的局限性，挖掘语言内在的结构特性。

Method: 通过适应性剪枝算法，计算权重重要性得分，生成高维向量，反映语言特性。

Result: 在多语种数据集上验证，结果符合已知的语言学分类，并揭示潜在的历史联系。

Conclusion: 该框架有效捕获语言本质，有助于跨语言研究和理解。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that utilizes the internal weight activations
of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct a metric space of
languages. Unlike traditional approaches based on hand-crafted linguistic
features, our method automatically derives high-dimensional vector
representations by computing weight importance scores via an adapted pruning
algorithm. Our approach captures intrinsic language characteristics that
reflect linguistic phenomena. We validate our approach across diverse datasets
and multilingual LLMs, covering 106 languages. The results align well with
established linguistic families while also revealing unexpected inter-language
connections that may indicate historical contact or language evolution. The
source code, computed language latent vectors, and visualization tool are made
publicly available at https://github.com/mshamrai/deep-language-geometry.

### [2] [Can we Evaluate RAGs with Synthetic Data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11758)
*Jonas van Elburg,Peter van der Putten,Maarten Marx*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 合成问答数据在排名检索机制中表现出一定可靠性，但在比较生成模型架构时存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决缺乏人类标注数据时，是否可用大规模语言模型生成的合成问答作为替代指标。

Method: 通过两组实验（调整检索参数与模型架构）评估合成问答的有效性，在四个数据集上进行验证。

Result: 合成问答能有效反映检索配置的变化，但在不同生成模型架构间的排名不稳定，原因可能包括任务不匹配和偏见。

Conclusion: 合成问答可作为检索机制评价的代理，但在模型架构比较方面仍需改进，注意任务匹配和偏见问题。

Abstract: We investigate whether synthetic question-answer (QA) data generated by large
language models (LLMs) can serve as an effective proxy for human-labeled
benchmarks when such data is unavailable. We assess the reliability of
synthetic benchmarks across two experiments: one varying retriever parameters
while keeping the generator fixed, and another varying the generator with fixed
retriever parameters. Across four datasets, of which two open-domain and two
proprietary, we find that synthetic benchmarks reliably rank the RAGs varying
in terms of retriever configuration, aligning well with human-labeled benchmark
baselines. However, they fail to produce consistent RAG rankings when comparing
generator architectures. The breakdown possibly arises from a combination of
task mismatch between the synthetic and human benchmarks, and stylistic bias
favoring certain generators.

### [3] [Limitation Learning: Catching Adverse Dialog with GAIL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11767)
*Noah Kasmanoff,Rahul Zalkikar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用模仿学习构建对话模型，并通过判别器识别模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索模仿学习在对话生成中的应用及其局限性，旨在提升对话模型的质量和安全性。

Method: 将模仿学习应用于对话任务，通过训练策略和判别器以区分专家示范与合成对话。

Result: 模型成功实现对话政策，判别器揭示了模型存在的限制，显示此方法用于识别不良行为具有潜力。

Conclusion: 模仿学习不仅可用于生成对话，还能作为检测模型潜在弊端的工具，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Imitation learning is a proven method for creating a policy in the absence of
rewards, by leveraging expert demonstrations. In this work, we apply imitation
learning to conversation. In doing so, we recover a policy capable of talking
to a user given a prompt (input state), and a discriminator capable of
classifying between expert and synthetic conversation. While our policy is
effective, we recover results from our discriminator that indicate the
limitations of dialog models. We argue that this technique can be used to
identify adverse behavior of arbitrary data models common for dialog oriented
tasks.

### [4] [Investigating Transcription Normalization in the Faetar ASR Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11771)
*Leo Peckham,Michael Ong,Naomi Nagy,Ewan Dunbar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 转录不一致不是Faetar自动语音识别性能下降的主要原因，限制词汇表有助于提升性能，但任务依然极具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨转录不一致在低资源ASR中的作用，尤其是对Faetar语音识别任务的影响。

Method: 通过分析转录中的不一致性，利用有限词汇模型，比较不同语言模型对识别性能的影响。

Result: 发现转录不一致性并非主要障碍，有限词汇约束有利于性能提升。大概率模型未展现明显优势。

Conclusion: 任务仍非常困难，未来需要探索更有效的模型与方法。

Abstract: We examine the role of transcription inconsistencies in the Faetar Automatic
Speech Recognition benchmark, a challenging low-resource ASR benchmark. With
the help of a small, hand-constructed lexicon, we conclude that find that,
while inconsistencies do exist in the transcriptions, they are not the main
challenge in the task. We also demonstrate that bigram word-based language
modelling is of no added benefit, but that constraining decoding to a finite
lexicon can be beneficial. The task remains extremely difficult.

### [5] [A Multi-Task Evaluation of LLMs' Processing of Academic Text Input](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11779)
*Tianyi Li,Yu Qin,Olivia R. Liu Sheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了大型语言模型在学术文本处理中的表现，发现其在摘要和改写方面较为可靠，但在文本排序、评分和深度反思方面能力有限，不宜无节制用于同行评审工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在科学发现和学术同行评审中的实际应用潜力及局限性。

Method: 通过设计四个基于不同角色的任务，采用三大顶级期刊的学术文章，结合多种文本评估指标，全面测试Google Gemini模型的性能表现。

Result: 模型在摘要和改写方面表现较好，但在文本排序、评分和深度反思任务中表现欠佳，难以提供有竞争力的支持。

Conclusion: 不建议无节制使用大型语言模型辅助学术同行评审，应保持谨慎态度，重视其局限性。

Abstract: How much large language models (LLMs) can aid scientific discovery, notably
in assisting academic peer review, is in heated debate. Between a literature
digest and a human-comparable research assistant lies their practical
application potential. We organize individual tasks that computer science
studies employ in separate terms into a guided and robust workflow to evaluate
LLMs' processing of academic text input. We employ four tasks in the
assessment: content reproduction/comparison/scoring/reflection, each demanding
a specific role of the LLM (oracle/judgmental arbiter/knowledgeable
arbiter/collaborator) in assisting scholarly works, and altogether testing LLMs
with questions that increasingly require intellectual capabilities towards a
solid understanding of scientific texts to yield desirable solutions. We
exemplify a rigorous performance evaluation with detailed instructions on the
prompts. Adopting first-rate Information Systems articles at three top journals
as the input texts and an abundant set of text metrics, we record a compromised
performance of the leading LLM - Google's Gemini: its summary and paraphrase of
academic text is acceptably reliable; using it to rank texts through pairwise
text comparison is faintly scalable; asking it to grade academic texts is prone
to poor discrimination; its qualitative reflection on the text is
self-consistent yet hardly insightful to inspire meaningful research. This
evidence against an endorsement of LLMs' text-processing capabilities is
consistent across metric-based internal (linguistic assessment), external
(comparing to the ground truth), and human evaluation, and is robust to the
variations of the prompt. Overall, we do not recommend an unchecked use of LLMs
in constructing peer reviews.

### [6] [LLM-Guided Planning and Summary-Based Scientific Text Simplification: DS@GT at CLEF 2025 SimpleText](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11816)
*Krishna Chaitanya Marturi,Heba H. Elwazzan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大规模语言模型的科学文本简化方法，结合结构化计划和总结引导，提升简化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文本复杂，亟需简化以增强可读性和理解。

Method: 利用LLMs生成结构化计划后逐句简化，或生成摘要引导全文简化。

Result: 实现了连贯、符合语境的科学文本简化，提高了简化质量。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的两阶段方法有效提升科学文本简化的效果和一致性。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach for the CLEF 2025 SimpleText Task 1,
which addresses both sentence-level and document-level scientific text
simplification. For sentence-level simplification, our methodology employs
large language models (LLMs) to first generate a structured plan, followed by
plan-driven simplification of individual sentences. At the document level, we
leverage LLMs to produce concise summaries and subsequently guide the
simplification process using these summaries. This two-stage, LLM-based
framework enables more coherent and contextually faithful simplifications of
scientific text.

### [7] [Hallucination Detection and Mitigation in Scientific Text Simplification using Ensemble Approaches: DS@GT at CLEF 2025 SimpleText](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11823)
*Krishna Chaitanya Marturi,Heba H. Elwazzan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多模型的集成框架，用于检测科学文本简化中的创造性生成和信息扭曲，并利用大模型进行后期编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学文本简化中创造性生成和信息扭曲的检测问题，确保简化内容的真实性和准确性。

Method: 采用BERT分类器、语义相似性、自然语言推理和大模型推理，通过元分类器融合多信号，并利用大模型进行后编辑。

Result: 提出的方法增强了对虚假和扭曲信息的检测鲁棒性，提升简化质量的控制能力。

Conclusion: 多策略结合的系统能有效检测与修正科学文本简化中的内容偏差，为学术文本自动简化提供可靠方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe our methodology for the CLEF 2025 SimpleText Task
2, which focuses on detecting and evaluating creative generation and
information distortion in scientific text simplification. Our solution
integrates multiple strategies: we construct an ensemble framework that
leverages BERT-based classifier, semantic similarity measure, natural language
inference model, and large language model (LLM) reasoning. These diverse
signals are combined using meta-classifiers to enhance the robustness of
spurious and distortion detection. Additionally, for grounded generation, we
employ an LLM-based post-editing system that revises simplifications based on
the original input texts.

### [8] [A Survey of Idiom Datasets for Psycholinguistic and Computational Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11828)
*Michael Flor,Xinyi Liu,Anna Feldman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了关于成语的心理语言学和计算语言学资源，分析了数据集的内容、形式及使用目的，强调两者缺乏结合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成语具有特殊的语义特性，研究其资源可促进自然语言处理和认知理解的发展。

Method: 分析了53个有关成语的心理学和计算学数据集，比较其内容、标注实践和任务设定。

Result: 尽管近年来在语言覆盖和任务多样性方面取得进展，但心理学和计算学资源之间尚缺乏联系。

Conclusion: 加强两者的融合研究，有助于深入理解和应用成语的语义特性。

Abstract: Idioms are figurative expressions whose meanings often cannot be inferred
from their individual words, making them difficult to process computationally
and posing challenges for human experimental studies. This survey reviews
datasets developed in psycholinguistics and computational linguistics for
studying idioms, focusing on their content, form, and intended use.
Psycholinguistic resources typically contain normed ratings along dimensions
such as familiarity, transparency, and compositionality, while computational
datasets support tasks like idiomaticity detection/classification,
paraphrasing, and cross-lingual modeling. We present trends in annotation
practices, coverage, and task framing across 53 datasets. Although recent
efforts expanded language coverage and task diversity, there seems to be no
relation yet between psycholinguistic and computational research on idioms.

### [9] [Every 28 Days the AI Dreams of Soft Skin and Burning Stars: Scaffolding AI Agents with Hormones and Emotions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11829)
*Leigh Levinson,Christopher J. Agostino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 将生物节律如激素循环作为自然相关性过滤器，嵌入大规模语言模型中，以提升其对信息的筛选和理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI系统在处理大量信息时面临的相关性筛选困难，利用生物学节律模仿自然筛选机制。

Method: 通过系统提示，将模拟的月经和昼夜节律周期，基于激素如雌激素、睾酮和皮质醇的周期性函数，嵌入多个先进的语言模型中进行调试。

Result: 分析显示模型在不同生理周期中表现出情感和风格的变化，且在标准测试中表现出与生物期望一致的性能波动，特别是在中等激素水平。

Conclusion: 生物节律为AI提供了一种新颖的上下文过滤方式，同时揭示了性别与生物相关偏见可能在语言模型中潜藏。

Abstract: Despite significant advances, AI systems struggle with the frame problem:
determining what information is contextually relevant from an exponentially
large possibility space. We hypothesize that biological rhythms, particularly
hormonal cycles, serve as natural relevance filters that could address this
fundamental challenge. We develop a framework that embeds simulated menstrual
and circadian cycles into Large Language Models through system prompts
generated from periodic functions modeling key hormones including estrogen,
testosterone, and cortisol. Across multiple state-of-the-art models, linguistic
analysis reveals emotional and stylistic variations that track biological
phases; sadness peaks during menstruation while happiness dominates ovulation
and circadian patterns show morning optimism transitioning to nocturnal
introspection. Benchmarking on SQuAD, MMLU, Hellaswag, and AI2-ARC demonstrates
subtle but consistent performance variations aligning with biological
expectations, including optimal function in moderate rather than extreme
hormonal ranges. This methodology provides a novel approach to contextual AI
while revealing how societal biases regarding gender and biology are embedded
within language models.

### [10] [When Does Language Transfer Help? Sequential Fine-Tuning for Cross-Lingual Euphemism Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11831)
*Julia Sammartino,Libby Barak,Jing Peng,Anna Feldman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 顺序微调在多语言委婉语识别中有效，尤其对低资源语言有帮助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言中委婉语识别的挑战，提升多语言模型性能。

Method: 比较XLM-R和mBERT进行单语、同步和顺序微调，分析其效果受语言特性和预训练覆盖的影响。

Result: 顺序微调利用高资源语言提升低资源语言表现，XLM-R表现优异但敏感，mBERT稳定但效果较低。

Conclusion: 顺序微调是一种简单有效的、多语言委婉语检测策略，特别适合低资源语言。

Abstract: Euphemisms are culturally variable and often ambiguous, posing challenges for
language models, especially in low-resource settings. This paper investigates
how cross-lingual transfer via sequential fine-tuning affects euphemism
detection across five languages: English, Spanish, Chinese, Turkish, and
Yoruba. We compare sequential fine-tuning with monolingual and simultaneous
fine-tuning using XLM-R and mBERT, analyzing how performance is shaped by
language pairings, typological features, and pretraining coverage. Results show
that sequential fine-tuning with a high-resource L1 improves L2 performance,
especially for low-resource languages like Yoruba and Turkish. XLM-R achieves
larger gains but is more sensitive to pretraining gaps and catastrophic
forgetting, while mBERT yields more stable, though lower, results. These
findings highlight sequential fine-tuning as a simple yet effective strategy
for improving euphemism detection in multilingual models, particularly when
low-resource languages are involved.

### [11] [SupraTok: Cross-Boundary Tokenization for Enhanced Language Model Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11857)
*Andrei-Valentin Tănase,Elena Pelican*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SupraTok提出一种创新的子词切分架构，通过多项技术提升分词效率和模型性能，显示出在多语言及语言理解任务中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的分词策略大多静态，尚未充分利用潜在的语义和模式信息，亟需创新以提升自然语言处理的效果。

Method: 引入跨边界模式学习、多阶段课程学习和基于熵的数据整理技术，实现超词Token的学习与优化。

Result: 在多语言环境下显著提高分词效率，并在GPT-2规模模型上提升多项下游任务表现，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 创新的分词架构有望成为推动语言模型性能提升的重要途径，未来需在更大模型规模上进一步验证。

Abstract: Tokenization remains a fundamental yet underexplored bottleneck in natural
language processing, with strategies largely static despite remarkable progress
in model architectures. We present SupraTok, a novel tokenization architecture
that reimagines subword segmentation through three innovations: cross-boundary
pattern learning that discovers multi-word semantic units, entropy-driven data
curation that optimizes training corpus quality, and multi-phase curriculum
learning for stable convergence. Our approach extends Byte-Pair Encoding by
learning "superword" tokens, coherent multi-word expressions that preserve
semantic unity while maximizing compression efficiency. SupraTok achieves 31%
improvement in English tokenization efficiency (5.91 versus 4.51 characters per
token) compared to OpenAI's o200k tokenizer and 30% improvement over Google's
Gemma 3 tokenizer (256k vocabulary), while maintaining competitive performance
across 38 languages. When integrated with a GPT-2 scale model (124M parameters)
trained on 10 billion tokens from the FineWeb-Edu dataset, SupraTok yields 8.4%
improvement on HellaSWAG and 9.5% on MMLU benchmarks without architectural
modifications. While these results are promising at this scale, further
validation at larger model scales is needed. These findings suggest that
efficient tokenization can complement architectural innovations as a path to
improved language model performance.

### [12] [In-Context Examples Matter: Improving Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11889)
*Hui Ma,Bo Zhang,Jinpeng Hu,Zenglin Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种单阶段的初始化指令调整框架InitERC，用于情感识别，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多阶段调优方法在捕获说话人特征、上下文和情感状态的联合作用上存在局限，影响模型的整体效果。

Method: 采用单一阶段的上下文指令调优，包括示例池构建、示例选择、模板设计及调优过程，重点研究示例影响因素。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上，InitERC显著优于现有方法，表现出色。

Conclusion: InitERC通过简化调优过程，有效增强模型对说话人、上下文和情感的联合理解，推动情感识别的发展。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) aims to identify the emotion of
each utterance in a conversation, playing a vital role in empathetic artificial
intelligence. With the growing of large language models (LLMs), instruction
tuning has emerged as a critical paradigm for ERC. Existing studies mainly
focus on multi-stage instruction tuning, which first endows LLMs with speaker
characteristics, and then conducts context-aware instruction tuning to
comprehend emotional states. However, these methods inherently constrains the
capacity to jointly capture the dynamic interaction between speaker
characteristics and conversational context, resulting in weak alignment among
speaker identity, contextual cues, and emotion states within a unified
framework. In this paper, we propose InitERC, a simple yet effective one-stage
in-context instruction tuning framework for ERC. InitERC adapts LLMs to learn
speaker-context-emotion alignment from context examples via in-context
instruction tuning. Specifically, InitERC comprises four components, i.e.,
demonstration pool construction, in-context example selection, prompt template
design, and in-context instruction tuning. To explore the impact of in-context
examples, we conduct a comprehensive study on three key factors: retrieval
strategy, example ordering, and the number of examples. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that our proposed InitERC achieves
substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 推出ChronoQA，为中文问答系统提供一个大型时间推理基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升检索增强生成系统中对时间推理的评估能力。

Method: 基于大量新闻文章构建数据集，涵盖多种时间类型和场景，经过多阶段验证确保数据质量。

Result: 提供一个动态、可靠的评测资源，促进时间敏感问答系统的发展。

Conclusion: ChronoQA为推动中文时间推理问答系统的研究提供了重要工具，促进其性能提升与应用扩展。

Abstract: We introduce ChronoQA, a large-scale benchmark dataset for Chinese question
answering, specifically designed to evaluate temporal reasoning in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. ChronoQA is constructed from over
300,000 news articles published between 2019 and 2024, and contains 5,176
high-quality questions covering absolute, aggregate, and relative temporal
types with both explicit and implicit time expressions. The dataset supports
both single- and multi-document scenarios, reflecting the real-world
requirements for temporal alignment and logical consistency. ChronoQA features
comprehensive structural annotations and has undergone multi-stage validation,
including rule-based, LLM-based, and human evaluation, to ensure data quality.
By providing a dynamic, reliable, and scalable resource, ChronoQA enables
structured evaluation across a wide range of temporal tasks, and serves as a
robust benchmark for advancing time-sensitive retrieval-augmented question
answering systems.

### [14] [CORE: Measuring Multi-Agent LLM Interaction Quality under Game-Theoretic Pressures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11915)
*Punya Syon Pandey,Yongjin Yang,Jiarui Liu,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CORE指标，用于衡量多智能体系统中文本的多样性和质量，通过Zipf和Heaps定律分析其表现，发现合作场景下语言更丰富，竞争场景下更有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏对多智能体LLM交互中语言多样性的量化分析。

Method: 引入CORE指标结合词汇混乱度、重复性和语义相似性，并借助Zipf和Heaps定律分析多场景下的对话特征。

Result: 合作场景显示更丰富的词汇和重复，竞争场景词汇受限。CORE指标有效评估多智能体对话的语言鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CORE提供了一种可靠的方法衡量多智能体LLM系统中的语言多样性，揭示社会激励对语言演化的影响。

Abstract: Game-theoretic interactions between agents with Large Language Models (LLMs)
have revealed many emergent capabilities, yet the linguistic diversity of these
interactions has not been sufficiently quantified. In this paper, we present
the Conversational Robustness Evaluation Score: CORE, a metric to quantify the
effectiveness of language use within multi-agent systems across different
game-theoretic interactions. CORE integrates measures of cluster entropy,
lexical repetition, and semantic similarity, providing a direct lens of dialog
quality. We apply CORE to pairwise LLM dialogs across competitive, cooperative,
and neutral settings, further grounding our analysis in Zipf's and Heaps' Laws
to characterize word frequency distributions and vocabulary growth. Our
findings show that cooperative settings exhibit both steeper Zipf distributions
and higher Heap exponents, indicating more repetition alongside greater
vocabulary expansion. In contrast, competitive interactions display lower Zipf
and Heaps exponents, reflecting less repetition and more constrained
vocabularies. These results provide new insights into how social incentives
influence language adaptation, and highlight CORE as a robust diagnostic for
measuring linguistic robustness in multi-agent LLM systems. Our code is
available at https://github.com/psyonp/core.

*Figarri Keisha,Prince Singh,Pallavi,Dion Fernandes,Aravindh Manivannan,Ilham Wicaksono,Faisal Ahmad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过改进检索和生成流程，提升法律领域中检索增强生成系统的准确性和成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决法律文本生成中的幻觉问题，增强模型的可信度。

Method: 引入上下文感知的查询转换器，采用开源检索策略，并构建全面评估框架。

Result: 显著提高检索效果和生成的合法性、相关性，展示开源方案与定制提示的优势。

Conclusion: 任务感知、组件微调能有效提升法律领域的RAG系统表现，兼具可信性和成本优势。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucinations by grounding
large language model outputs in cited sources, a capability that is especially
critical in the legal domain. We present an end-to-end RAG pipeline that
revisits and extends the LegalBenchRAG baseline with three targeted
enhancements: (i) a context-aware query translator that disentangles document
references from natural-language questions and adapts retrieval depth and
response style based on expertise and specificity, (ii) open-source retrieval
strategies using SBERT and GTE embeddings that achieve substantial performance
gains (improving Recall@K by 30-95\% and Precision@K by $\sim$2.5$\times$ for
$K>4$) while remaining cost-efficient, and (iii) a comprehensive evaluation and
generation framework that combines RAGAS, BERTScore-F1, and ROUGE-Recall to
assess semantic alignment and faithfulness across models and prompt designs.
Our results show that carefully designed open-source pipelines can rival or
outperform proprietary approaches in retrieval quality, while a custom
legal-grounded prompt consistently produces more faithful and contextually
relevant answers than baseline prompting. Taken together, these contributions
demonstrate the potential of task-aware, component-level tuning to deliver
legally grounded, reproducible, and cost-effective RAG systems for legal
research assistance.

*Jie Lu,Du Jin,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 针对汉语和日语中完美体的时态推理问题，构建了基于模板的NLI数据集，发现先进大型语言模型在时态推断方面仍有较大困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非英语语言中完美体时态推理的挑战，深入理解跨语言的时态语义特点。

Method: 构建包含每种语言1350对数据的模板式NLI数据集，进行模型在时态推断任务上的评估。

Result: 实验显示，尽管模型先进，但在细微的时态和参照时间转换方面表现不足，反映模型在跨语言时态理解上的局限。

Conclusion: 强调了跨语言时间语义评估的重要性，为未来改进模型的时态推理能力提供了数据资源。

Abstract: Unlike English, which uses distinct forms (e.g., had, has, will have) to mark
the perfect aspect across tenses, Chinese and Japanese lack separate
grammatical forms for tense within the perfect aspect, which complicates
Natural Language Inference (NLI). Focusing on the perfect aspect in these
languages, we construct a linguistically motivated, template-based NLI dataset
(1,350 pairs per language). Experiments reveal that even advanced LLMs struggle
with temporal inference, particularly in detecting subtle tense and
reference-time shifts. These findings highlight model limitations and
underscore the need for cross-linguistic evaluation in temporal semantics. Our
dataset is available at https://github.com/Lujie2001/CrossNLI.

### [17] [CAMF: Collaborative Adversarial Multi-agent Framework for Machine Generated Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11933)
*Yue Wang,Liesheng Wei,Yuxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体合作对抗架构（CAMF）的检测方案，有效识别由大型语言模型生成的文本，比现有技术更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成文本的广泛应用，及时检测机器生成内容的需求日益增长，现有方法存在分析浅薄和缺乏跨维度一致性检测的问题。

Method: 引入多智能体合作对抗框架（CAMF），通过多阶段深度分析从风格、语义和逻辑等多维度检测文本异常。

Result: 实验证明CAMF在零样本检测中显著优于现有先进技术，表现出较强的检测能力。

Conclusion: 该模型通过系统性多维分析，有效提升机器文本检测的准确性，为应对生成内容的安全挑战提供了一种新思路。

Abstract: Detecting machine-generated text (MGT) from contemporary Large Language
Models (LLMs) is increasingly crucial amid risks like disinformation and
threats to academic integrity. Existing zero-shot detection paradigms, despite
their practicality, often exhibit significant deficiencies. Key challenges
include: (1) superficial analyses focused on limited textual attributes, and
(2) a lack of investigation into consistency across linguistic dimensions such
as style, semantics, and logic. To address these challenges, we introduce the
\textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{M}ulti-agent
\textbf{F}ramework (\textbf{CAMF}), a novel architecture using multiple
LLM-based agents. CAMF employs specialized agents in a synergistic three-phase
process: \emph{Multi-dimensional Linguistic Feature Extraction},
\emph{Adversarial Consistency Probing}, and \emph{Synthesized Judgment
Aggregation}. This structured collaborative-adversarial process enables a deep
analysis of subtle, cross-dimensional textual incongruities indicative of
non-human origin. Empirical evaluations demonstrate CAMF's significant
superiority over state-of-the-art zero-shot MGT detection techniques.

Result: 在TACRED和FewRel数据集上实验，取得了新的状态-of-the-art性能，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 强调在连续关系抽取中，专项利用错误案例进行调优的重要性，提升模型的泛化能力与稳健性。

Abstract: Continual Relation Extraction (CRE) aims to continually learn new emerging
relations while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Existing CRE methods mainly
use memory replay and contrastive learning to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
However, these methods do not attach importance to the error cases that can
reveal the model's cognitive biases more effectively. To address this issue, we
propose an instruction-based continual contrastive tuning approach for Large
Language Models (LLMs) in CRE. Different from existing CRE methods that
typically handle the training and memory data in a unified manner, this
approach splits the training and memory data of each task into two parts
respectively based on the correctness of the initial responses and treats them
differently through dual-task fine-tuning. In addition, leveraging the
advantages of LLM's instruction-following ability, we propose a novel
instruction-based contrastive tuning strategy for LLM to continuously correct
current cognitive biases with the guidance of previous data in an
instruction-tuning manner, which mitigates the gap between old and new
relations in a more suitable way for LLMs. We experimentally evaluate our model
on TACRED and FewRel, and the results show that our model achieves new
state-of-the-art CRE performance with significant improvements, demonstrating
the importance of specializing in exploiting error cases.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，FineCE优于现有方法，表现出更优的置信度估计效果。

Conclusion: FineCE能在文本生成全过程中提供更细粒度、更准确的置信度估计，增强模型的可信性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse tasks, they fundamentally lack self-awareness and frequently
exhibit overconfidence, assigning high confidence scores to incorrect
predictions. Accurate confidence estimation is therefore critical for enhancing
the trustworthiness and reliability of LLM-generated outputs. However, existing
approaches suffer from coarse-grained scoring mechanisms that fail to provide
fine-grained, continuous confidence estimates throughout the generation
process. To address these limitations, we introduce FineCE, a novel confidence
estimation method that delivers accurate, fine-grained confidence scores during
text generation. Specifically, we first develop a comprehensive pipeline for
constructing training data that effectively captures the underlying
probabilistic distribution of LLM responses, and then train a model to predict
confidence scores for arbitrary text sequences in a supervised manner.
Furthermore, we propose a Backward Confidence Integration (BCI) strategy that
leverages information from the subsequent text to enhance confidence estimation
for the current sequence during inference. We also introduce three strategies
for identifying optimal positions to perform confidence estimation within the
generation process. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that FineCE consistently outperforms existing classical confidence
estimation methods. Our code and all baselines used in the paper are available
on GitHub.

*Yao Wu*

TL;DR: 提出J6方法，通过结构雅可比分解多目标优化中的梯度互动，为大语言模型的提示参数微调提供冲突感知和适应性优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大语言模型微调中平衡多个目标（如事实性和置信度）具有挑战，现有方法忽视目标间的几何结构。

Method: 引入结构雅可比分解，将梯度交互矩阵分解为六个可解释的成分，结合硬决策和软加权策略，形成动态优化框架。

Result: 提出的J6方法提供了更具解释性的参数归因和冲突检测手段，优化策略具适应性和扩展性。

Conclusion: J6为多目标神经调优引入结构雅可比机制，促进结构化理解与冲突感知在提示优化中的应用。

Abstract: In large language model (LLM) adaptation, balancing multiple optimization
objectives such as improving factuality (heat) and increasing confidence (via
low entropy) poses a fundamental challenge, especially when prompt parameters
(e.g., hidden-layer insertions h and embedding modifications w) interact in
non-trivial ways. Existing multi-objective optimization strategies often rely
on scalar gradient aggregation, ignoring the deeper geometric structure between
objectives and parameters. We propose J6, a structured Jacobian-based method
that decomposes the gradient interaction matrix into six interpretable
components. This decomposition enables both hard decision-making (e.g.,
choosing the dominant update direction via argmax) and soft strategies (e.g.,
attention-style weighting via softmax over J6), forming a dynamic update
framework that adapts to local conflict and synergy. Moreover, the
interpretable structure of J6 provides insight into parameter attribution, task
interference, and geometry-aligned adaptation. Our work introduces a principled
and extensible mechanism for conflict-aware prompt optimization, and opens a
new avenue for incorporating structured Jacobian reasoning into multi-objective
neural tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结构化过渡评估（STEM）方法，用于高效、可解释地评估大型语言模型能力的相对水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型能力快速提升，传统评估方法难以反映实际能力差异，存在过拟合和高成本问题。

Method: 通过分析相同架构但参数规模不同的模型性能变化，识别关键过渡样本，以此估算模型能力。

Result: STEM在多个基准测试上成功捕捉性能趋势，与模型真实能力排名一致，效果可靠。

Conclusion: STEM是一种实用、可扩展的评估工具，适用于大模型的细粒度、架构无关的能力评估。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly challenging
as model capabilities advance rapidly. While recent models often achieve higher
scores on standard benchmarks, these improvements do not consistently reflect
enhanced real-world reasoning capabilities. Moreover, widespread overfitting to
public benchmarks and the high computational cost of full evaluations have made
it both expensive and less effective to distinguish meaningful differences
between models. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{S}tructured
\textbf{T}ransition \textbf{E}valuation \textbf{M}ethod (STEM), a lightweight
and interpretable evaluation framework for efficiently estimating the relative
capabilities of LLMs. STEM identifies \textit{significant transition samples}
(STS) by analyzing consistent performance transitions among LLMs of the same
architecture but varying parameter scales. These samples enable STEM to
effectively estimate the capability position of an unknown model. Qwen3 model
family is applied to construct the STS pool on six diverse and representative
benchmarks. To assess generalizability. Experimental results indicate that STEM
reliably captures performance trends, aligns with ground-truth rankings of
model capability. These findings highlight STEM as a practical and scalable
method for fine-grained, architecture-agnostic evaluation of LLMs.

Motivation: 旨在理解思考预算对医疗推理模型性能的影响，从而优化医疗AI系统的资源利用和性能表现。

Method: 对两类模型（Qwen3和DeepSeek-R1）在多样医疗数据集上进行控制条件实验，调整思考预算，分析模型表现与资源关系，识别不同效率区间。

Result: 发现推理准确性随思考预算和模型规模呈对数增长，划分为高效、平衡和高精度三个区间。较小模型在延长思考时间方面获益更多，领域差异明显，验证了思考预算在不同模型架构中的适用性。

Conclusion: 思考预算控制是优化医疗AI的关键机制，有助于动态资源调配和提高模型透明度，适应不同临床需求。

Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of thinking budget
mechanisms in medical reasoning tasks, revealing fundamental scaling laws
between computational resources and reasoning quality. We systematically
evaluated two major model families, Qwen3 (1.7B to 235B parameters) and
DeepSeek-R1 (1.5B to 70B parameters), across 15 medical datasets spanning
diverse specialties and difficulty levels. Through controlled experiments with
thinking budgets ranging from zero to unlimited tokens, we establish
logarithmic scaling relationships where accuracy improvements follow a
predictable pattern with both thinking budget and model size. Our findings
identify three distinct efficiency regimes: high-efficiency (0 to 256 tokens)
suitable for real-time applications, balanced (256 to 512 tokens) offering
optimal cost-performance tradeoffs for routine clinical support, and
high-accuracy (above 512 tokens) justified only for critical diagnostic tasks.
Notably, smaller models demonstrate disproportionately larger benefits from
extended thinking, with 15 to 20% improvements compared to 5 to 10% for larger
models, suggesting a complementary relationship where thinking budget provides
greater relative benefits for capacity-constrained models. Domain-specific
patterns emerge clearly, with neurology and gastroenterology requiring
significantly deeper reasoning processes than cardiovascular or respiratory
medicine. The consistency between Qwen3 native thinking budget API and our
proposed truncation method for DeepSeek-R1 validates the generalizability of
thinking budget concepts across architectures. These results establish thinking
budget control as a critical mechanism for optimizing medical AI systems,
enabling dynamic resource allocation aligned with clinical needs while
maintaining the transparency essential for healthcare deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言处理中的隐私评估困难，探索LLMs作为评估工具的可行性。

Method: 通过10个数据集、13个大型语言模型和677名人类调查参与者的实验，分析LLMs与人类关于隐私感知的契合程度。

Result: LLMs能准确反映整体人类隐私观点，但隐私定义具有主观性和难测性，导致人际间一致性低。

Conclusion: LLMs在隐私评估方面具有潜力，但仍需面对隐私主观性和定义模糊的问题，未来可进一步研究优化其应用。

Abstract: Despite advances in the field of privacy-preserving Natural Language
Processing (NLP), a significant challenge remains the accurate evaluation of
privacy. As a potential solution, using LLMs as a privacy evaluator presents a
promising approach $\unicode{x2013}$ a strategy inspired by its success in
other subfields of NLP. In particular, the so-called $\textit{LLM-as-a-Judge}$
paradigm has achieved impressive results on a variety of natural language
evaluation tasks, demonstrating high agreement rates with human annotators.
Recognizing that privacy is both subjective and difficult to define, we
investigate whether LLM-as-a-Judge can also be leveraged to evaluate the
privacy sensitivity of textual data. Furthermore, we measure how closely LLM
evaluations align with human perceptions of privacy in text. Resulting from a
study involving 10 datasets, 13 LLMs, and 677 human survey participants, we
confirm that privacy is indeed a difficult concept to measure empirically,
exhibited by generally low inter-human agreement rates. Nevertheless, we find
that LLMs can accurately model a global human privacy perspective, and through
an analysis of human and LLM reasoning patterns, we discuss the merits and
limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge for privacy evaluation in textual data. Our
findings pave the way for exploring the feasibility of LLMs as privacy
evaluators, addressing a core challenge in solving pressing privacy issues with
innovative technical solutions.

Motivation: 东南亚区域缺乏专属的语义嵌入基准，导致模型在该地区语言上的表现不佳。

Method: 构建SEA-BED，收集169个数据集，分析不同任务和语言的模型表现，比较人类与机器翻译的影响。

Result: 揭示SEA语言的性能差异及挑战，强调人类标注数据对低资源语言的重要性。

Conclusion: 专属的东南亚嵌入基准能帮助理解地区特性，提升模型表现，同时需重视数据来源的质量。

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are essential for NLP tasks such as semantic search,
re-ranking, and textual similarity. Although multilingual benchmarks like MMTEB
broaden coverage, Southeast Asia (SEA) datasets are scarce and often
machine-translated, missing native linguistic properties. With nearly 700
million speakers, the SEA region lacks a region-specific embedding benchmark.
We introduce SEA-BED, the first large-scale SEA embedding benchmark with 169
datasets across 9 tasks and 10 languages, where 71% are formulated by humans,
not machine generation or translation. We address three research questions: (1)
which SEA languages and tasks are challenging, (2) whether SEA languages show
unique performance gaps globally, and (3) how human vs. machine translations
affect evaluation. We evaluate 17 embedding models across six studies,
analyzing task and language challenges, cross-benchmark comparisons, and
translation trade-offs. Results show sharp ranking shifts, inconsistent model
performance among SEA languages, and the importance of human-curated datasets
for low-resource languages like Burmese.

Motivation: 当前对SFM的理解主要集中在性能方面，缺乏对其知识结构的深入分析，并且在语音理解（SLU）任务中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用统计工具与无训练任务构建分析框架，对多种SFM进行比较，开发面向NER和NEL的新任务，并评估端到端模型在SLU中的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了有价值的分析工具和数据集，促进对SFM的理解，为未来模型设计和应用提供指导。

Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs) are designed to serve as general-purpose
representations for a wide range of speech-processing tasks. The last five
years have seen an influx of increasingly successful self-supervised and
supervised pre-trained models with impressive performance on various downstream
tasks.
  Although the zoo of SFMs continues to grow, our understanding of the
knowledge they acquire lags behind. This thesis presents a lightweight analysis
framework using statistical tools and training-free tasks to investigate the
acoustic and linguistic knowledge encoded in SFM layers. We conduct a
comparative study across multiple SFMs and statistical tools. Our study also
shows that the analytical insights have concrete implications for downstream
task performance.
  The effectiveness of an SFM is ultimately determined by its performance on
speech applications. Yet it remains unclear whether the benefits extend to
spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks that require a deeper understanding
than widely studied ones, such as speech recognition. The limited exploration
of SLU is primarily due to a lack of relevant datasets. To alleviate that, this
thesis contributes tasks, specifically spoken named entity recognition (NER)
and named entity localization (NEL), to the Spoken Language Understanding
Evaluation benchmark. We develop SFM-based approaches for NER and NEL, and find
that end-to-end (E2E) models leveraging SFMs can surpass traditional cascaded
(speech recognition followed by a text model) approaches. Further, we evaluate
E2E SLU models across SFMs and adaptation strategies to assess the impact on
task performance.
  Collectively, this thesis tackles previously unanswered questions about SFMs,
providing tools and datasets to further our understanding and to enable the
community to make informed design choices for future model development and
adoption.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning across diverse domains. However, effective reasoning in real-world
tasks requires adapting the reasoning strategy to the demands of the problem,
ranging from fast, intuitive responses to deliberate, step-by-step reasoning
and tool-augmented thinking. Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, we
propose a novel taxonomy of LLM reasoning strategies along two knowledge
boundaries: a fast/slow boundary separating intuitive from deliberative
processes, and an internal/external boundary distinguishing reasoning grounded
in the model's parameters from reasoning augmented by external tools. We
systematically survey recent work on adaptive reasoning in LLMs and categorize
methods based on key decision factors. We conclude by highlighting open
challenges and future directions toward more adaptive, efficient, and reliable
LLMs.

Conclusion: 大语言模型在自我预测能力方面存在根本瓶颈，提示未来模型设计需考虑更有效的自我推理机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on tasks that test their
knowledge or reasoning abilities. In this paper, we explore a different type of
evaluation: whether an LLM can predict aspects of its own responses. Since LLMs
lack the ability to execute themselves, we introduce the Self-Execution
Benchmark, which measures a model's ability to anticipate properties of its
output, such as whether a question will be difficult for it, whether it will
refuse to answer, or what kinds of associations it is likely to produce. Our
experiments show that models generally perform poorly on this benchmark, and
that increased model size or capability does not consistently lead to better
performance. These results suggest a fundamental limitation in how LLMs
represent and reason about their own behavior.

Abstract: Legal Artificial Intelligence (LegalAI) has achieved notable advances in
automating judicial decision-making with the support of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, existing legal LLMs still struggle to generate reliable and
interpretable reasoning processes. They often default to fast-thinking behavior
by producing direct answers without explicit multi-step reasoning, limiting
their effectiveness in complex legal scenarios that demand rigorous
justification. To address this challenge, we propose Legal$\Delta$, a
reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance legal reasoning through
chain-of-thought guided information gain. During training, Legal$\Delta$
employs a dual-mode input setup-comprising direct answer and
reasoning-augmented modes-and maximizes the information gain between them. This
encourages the model to acquire meaningful reasoning patterns rather than
generating superficial or redundant explanations. Legal$\Delta$ follows a
two-stage approach: (1) distilling latent reasoning capabilities from a
powerful Large Reasoning Model (LRM), DeepSeek-R1, and (2) refining reasoning
quality via differential comparisons, combined with a multidimensional reward
mechanism that assesses both structural coherence and legal-domain specificity.
Experimental results on multiple legal reasoning tasks demonstrate that
Legal$\Delta$ outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and
interpretability. It consistently produces more robust and trustworthy legal
judgments without relying on labeled preference data. All code and data will be
released at https://github.com/NEUIR/LegalDelta.

Result: MT-DT模型在实验中优于基线模型，验证了结合法律逻辑提升预测效果的可行性。

Conclusion: 融合法律逻辑的深度学习模型有助于改进假释预测，为司法决策提供更智能的支持。

Abstract: Probation is a crucial institution in modern criminal law, embodying the
principles of fairness and justice while contributing to the harmonious
development of society. Despite its importance, the current Intelligent
Judicial Assistant System (IJAS) lacks dedicated methods for probation
prediction, and research on the underlying factors influencing probation
eligibility remains limited. In addition, probation eligibility requires a
comprehensive analysis of both criminal circumstances and remorse. Much of the
existing research in IJAS relies primarily on data-driven methodologies, which
often overlooks the legal logic underpinning judicial decision-making. To
address this gap, we propose a novel approach that integrates legal logic into
deep learning models for probation prediction, implemented in three distinct
stages. First, we construct a specialized probation dataset that includes fact
descriptions and probation legal elements (PLEs). Second, we design a distinct
probation prediction model named the Multi-Task Dual-Theory Probation
Prediction Model (MT-DT), which is grounded in the legal logic of probation and
the \textit{Dual-Track Theory of Punishment}. Finally, our experiments on the
probation dataset demonstrate that the MT-DT model outperforms baseline models,
and an analysis of the underlying legal logic further validates the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has seen remarkable progress, with models
like OpenAI Whisper and NVIDIA Canary achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance in offline transcription. However, these models are not designed
for streaming (online or real-time) transcription, due to limitations in their
architecture and training methodology. We propose a method to turn the
transformer encoder-decoder model into a low-latency streaming model that is
careless about future context. We present an analysis explaining why it is not
straightforward to convert an encoder-decoder transformer to a low-latency
streaming model. Our proposed method modifies the existing (non-causal) encoder
to a causal encoder by fine-tuning both the encoder and decoder using Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) and a weakly aligned dataset. We then propose an updated
inference mechanism that utilizes the fine-tune causal encoder and decoder to
yield greedy and beam-search decoding, and is shown to be locally optimal.
Experiments on low-latency chunk sizes (less than 300 msec) show that our
fine-tuned model outperforms existing non-fine-tuned streaming approaches in
most cases, while using a lower complexity. Additionally, we observe that our
training process yields better alignment, enabling a simple method for
extracting word-level timestamps. We release our training and inference code,
along with the fine-tuned models, to support further research and development
in streaming ASR.

Result: 8个先进的大规模语言模型在NATCONFQA上的表现不佳，显示出处理冲突的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 当前模型在多答案问答中处理冲突仍然存在明显不足，亟需改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in question
answering (QA) tasks. However, Multi-Answer Question Answering (MAQA), where a
question may have several valid answers, remains challenging. Traditional QA
settings often assume consistency across evidences, but MAQA can involve
conflicting answers. Constructing datasets that reflect such conflicts is
costly and labor-intensive, while existing benchmarks often rely on synthetic
data, restrict the task to yes/no questions, or apply unverified automated
annotation. To advance research in this area, we extend the conflict-aware MAQA
setting to require models not only to identify all valid answers, but also to
detect specific conflicting answer pairs, if any. To support this task, we
introduce a novel cost-effective methodology for leveraging fact-checking
datasets to construct NATCONFQA, a new benchmark for realistic, conflict-aware
MAQA, enriched with detailed conflict labels, for all answer pairs. We evaluate
eight high-end LLMs on NATCONFQA, revealing their fragility in handling various
types of conflicts and the flawed strategies they employ to resolve them.

Motivation: 解决小型语言模型在复杂推理中的表现不足，特别是在推理能力、自主性和泛化能力方面的限制。

Conclusion: ReaLM通过多方面创新实现小型模型的鲁棒推理，展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) are a cost-effective alternative to Large
Language Models (LLMs), but often struggle with complex reasoning due to their
limited capacity and a tendency to produce mistakes or inconsistent answers
during multi-step reasoning. Existing efforts have improved SLM performance,
but typically at the cost of one or more of three key aspects: (1) reasoning
capability, due to biased supervision that filters out negative reasoning paths
and limits learning from errors; (2) autonomy, due to over-reliance on
externally generated reasoning signals; and (3) generalization, which suffers
when models overfit to teacher-specific patterns. In this paper, we introduce
ReaLM, a reinforcement learning framework for robust and self-sufficient
reasoning in vertical domains. To enhance reasoning capability, we propose
Multi-Route Process Verification (MRPV), which contrasts both positive and
negative reasoning paths to extract decisive patterns. To reduce reliance on
external guidance and improve autonomy, we introduce Enabling Autonomy via
Asymptotic Induction (EAAI), a training strategy that gradually fades external
signals. To improve generalization, we apply guided chain-of-thought
distillation to encode domain-specific rules and expert knowledge into SLM
parameters, making them part of what the model has learned. Extensive
experiments on both vertical and general reasoning tasks demonstrate that ReaLM
significantly improves SLM performance across aspects (1)-(3) above.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着医学文献的快速增长，传统的知识图谱构建方法难以应对知识的时序演变和不确定性，亟需动态、自动化的解决方案。

Method: 采用两个基于Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct的专用代理，逐日从PubMed文献中抽取知识三元组，结合置信评分过滤低质量信息，并逐步构建时间演变的医学知识图谱。

Result: 构建的知识图谱包含156,275实体和2,971,384关系三元组，准确率达90%以上，并在多项医学问答任务中显著优于非增强方法，且在药物重用途的推断中表现突出。

Conclusion: MedKGent有效应对医学知识的时序动态变化，为医学AI应用提供了高质量、可信赖的知识基础，推动医学智能化发展。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of medical literature presents growing challenges for
structuring and integrating domain knowledge at scale. Knowledge Graphs (KGs)
offer a promising solution by enabling efficient retrieval, automated
reasoning, and knowledge discovery. However, current KG construction methods
often rely on supervised pipelines with limited generalizability or naively
aggregate outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), treating biomedical
corpora as static and ignoring the temporal dynamics and contextual uncertainty
of evolving knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce MedKGent, a
LLM agent framework for constructing temporally evolving medical KGs.
Leveraging over 10 million PubMed abstracts published between 1975 and 2023, we
simulate the emergence of biomedical knowledge via a fine-grained daily time
series. MedKGent incrementally builds the KG in a day-by-day manner using two
specialized agents powered by the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model. The Extractor
Agent identifies knowledge triples and assigns confidence scores via
sampling-based estimation, which are used to filter low-confidence extractions
and inform downstream processing. The Constructor Agent incrementally
integrates the retained triples into a temporally evolving graph, guided by
confidence scores and timestamps to reinforce recurring knowledge and resolve
conflicts. The resulting KG contains 156,275 entities and 2,971,384 relational
triples. Quality assessments by two SOTA LLMs and three domain experts
demonstrate an accuracy approaching 90\%, with strong inter-rater agreement. To
evaluate downstream utility, we conduct RAG across seven medical question
answering benchmarks using five leading LLMs, consistently observing
significant improvements over non-augmented baselines. Case studies further
demonstrate the KG's value in literature-based drug repurposing via
confidence-aware causal inference.

Motivation: COVID-19后遗症症状多样且变化难以诊断，亟需高效准确的自动化工具。

Method: 结合规则基础命名实体识别与BERT断言检测，构建涵盖临床专家的PASC症状词库，在多地区多系统临床笔记上进行模型训练和验证。

Abstract: Accurately and efficiently diagnosing Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC)
remains challenging due to its myriad symptoms that evolve over long- and
variable-time intervals. To address this issue, we developed a hybrid natural
language processing pipeline that integrates rule-based named entity
recognition with BERT-based assertion detection modules for PASC-symptom
extraction and assertion detection from clinical notes. We developed a
comprehensive PASC lexicon with clinical specialists. From 11 health systems of
the RECOVER initiative network across the U.S., we curated 160 intake progress
notes for model development and evaluation, and collected 47,654 progress notes
for a population-level prevalence study. We achieved an average F1 score of
0.82 in one-site internal validation and 0.76 in 10-site external validation
for assertion detection. Our pipeline processed each note at $2.448\pm 0.812$
seconds on average. Spearman correlation tests showed $\rho >0.83$ for positive
mentions and $\rho >0.72$ for negative ones, both with $P <0.0001$. These
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our models and their potential
for improving PASC diagnosis.

<details>

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）对长上下文处理能力的需求提升，减少KV缓存的内存消耗成为关键，同时提升效率。

Method: 设计一种新准则，确保每层中只集中特定类型的注意力头（检索或流式），以避免双重计算造成的额外延迟。

Result: ZigzagAttention在减少延迟方面表现优异，性能与基线模型相当，显示出优越的性价比。

Conclusion: 通过在模型层中专门化注意力头类型，有效提升长文本处理效率，减少延迟，对大规模语言模型具有实际指导意义。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), handling long
context has become one of the vital abilities in LLMs. Such long-context
ability is accompanied by difficulties in deployment, especially due to the
increased consumption of KV cache. There is certain work aiming to optimize the
memory footprint of KV cache, inspired by the observation that attention heads
can be categorized into retrieval heads that are of great significance and
streaming heads that are of less significance. Typically, identifying the
streaming heads and and waiving the KV cache in the streaming heads would
largely reduce the overhead without hurting the performance that much. However,
since employing both retrieval and streaming heads in one layer decomposes one
large round of attention computation into two small ones, it may unexpectedly
bring extra latency on accessing and indexing tensors. Based on this intuition,
we impose an important improvement to the identification process of retrieval
and streaming heads, in which we design a criterion that enforces exclusively
retrieval or streaming heads gathered in one unique layer. In this way, we
further eliminate the extra latency and only incur negligible performance
degradation. Our method named \textsc{ZigzagAttention} is competitive among
considered baselines owing to reduced latency and comparable performance.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型中潜藏的文化和伦理假设，关注其文化倾向对AI应用的影响。

Method: 设计200个跨文化prompt，比较西方和东方模型的表现，并通过人类标注和文化对齐指数进行分析。

Result: GPT-4偏向个人主义和低权力距离，ERNIE偏向集体主义和高权力距离，两者与各自文化背景高度一致。

Conclusion: LLMs反映其训练语料的文化特征，应重视文化导向的评估与部署，避免文化霸权影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, yet their underlying
cultural and ethical assumptions remain underexplored. We propose the notion of
a "cultural gene" -- a systematic value orientation that LLMs inherit from
their training corpora -- and introduce a Cultural Probe Dataset (CPD) of 200
prompts targeting two classic cross-cultural dimensions:
Individualism-Collectivism (IDV) and Power Distance (PDI). Using standardized
zero-shot prompts, we compare a Western-centric model (GPT-4) and an
Eastern-centric model (ERNIE Bot). Human annotation shows significant and
consistent divergence across both dimensions. GPT-4 exhibits individualistic
and low-power-distance tendencies (IDV score approx 1.21; PDI score approx
-1.05), while ERNIE Bot shows collectivistic and higher-power-distance
tendencies (IDV approx -0.89; PDI approx 0.76); differences are statistically
significant (p < 0.001). We further compute a Cultural Alignment Index (CAI)
against Hofstede's national scores and find GPT-4 aligns more closely with the
USA (e.g., IDV CAI approx 0.91; PDI CAI approx 0.88) whereas ERNIE Bot aligns
more closely with China (IDV CAI approx 0.85; PDI CAI approx 0.81). Qualitative
analyses of dilemma resolution and authority-related judgments illustrate how
these orientations surface in reasoning. Our results support the view that LLMs
function as statistical mirrors of their cultural corpora and motivate
culturally aware evaluation and deployment to avoid algorithmic cultural
hegemony.

Result: 模型在长文本输入下能学习和编码物理变量，如能量，展示了有效的物理推理能力。

Conclusion: LLMs在上下文学习中可以编码关键物理概念，为理解其推理机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive in-context learning (ICL)
abilities, enabling them to solve wide range of tasks via textual prompts
alone. As these capabilities advance, the range of applicable domains continues
to expand significantly. However, identifying the precise mechanisms or
internal structures within LLMs that allow successful ICL across diverse,
distinct classes of tasks remains elusive. Physics-based tasks offer a
promising testbed for probing this challenge. Unlike synthetic sequences such
as basic arithmetic or symbolic equations, physical systems provide
experimentally controllable, real-world data based on structured dynamics
grounded in fundamental principles. This makes them particularly suitable for
studying the emergent reasoning behaviors of LLMs in a realistic yet tractable
setting. Here, we mechanistically investigate the ICL ability of LLMs,
especially focusing on their ability to reason about physics. Using a dynamics
forecasting task in physical systems as a proxy, we evaluate whether LLMs can
learn physics in context. We first show that the performance of dynamics
forecasting in context improves with longer input contexts. To uncover how such
capability emerges in LLMs, we analyze the model's residual stream activations
using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). Our experiments reveal that the features
captured by SAEs correlate with key physical variables, such as energy. These
findings demonstrate that meaningful physical concepts are encoded within LLMs
during in-context learning. In sum, our work provides a novel case study that
broadens our understanding of how LLMs learn in context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对大规模视觉-语言模型开发中的高成本和数据不足问题，特别是在偏好优化和微调中的挑战。

Method: 通过智能选择模型生成的候选偏好对，结合多模态对齐分数与模型自信度，构建M3P-Score，用于指导高效的偏好优化。

Result: 在多个多模态指令跟随基准测试中，M3PO优于SFT、RLHF、DPO和RM-DPO等方法，表现优异。

Conclusion: M3PO是一种高效、有效的偏好优化策略，显著改善LVLMs的性能，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) hold immense potential for complex
multimodal instruction following, yet their development is often hindered by
the high cost and inconsistency of human annotation required for effective
fine-tuning and preference alignment. Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and existing preference optimization methods like RLHF and DPO frequently
struggle to efficiently leverage the model's own generation space to identify
highly informative "hard negative" samples. To address these challenges, we
propose Multimodal-Model-Guided Preference Optimization (M3PO), a novel and
data-efficient method designed to enhance LVLMs' capabilities in visual
instruction following. M3PO intelligently selects the most "learning-valuable"
preference sample pairs from a diverse pool of LVLM-generated candidates. This
selection is driven by a sophisticated mechanism that integrates two crucial
signals: a Multimodal Alignment Score (MAS) to assess external quality and the
model's Self-Consistency / Confidence (log-probability) to gauge internal
belief. These are combined into a novel M3P-Score, which specifically
identifies preferred responses and challenging dispreferred responses that the
model might confidently generate despite being incorrect. These high-quality
preference pairs are then used for efficient Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) fine-tuning on base LVLMs like LLaVA-1.5 (7B/13B) using LoRA. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that M3PO consistently outperforms strong
baselines, including SFT, simulated RLHF, vanilla DPO, and RM-DPO, across a
comprehensive suite of multimodal instruction following benchmarks (MME-Bench,
POPE, IFT, Human Pref. Score).

Motivation: 由于印尼作为世界人口最多国家之一，拥有丰富的语言资源，但在自然语言处理发展方面依然落后，该研究旨在推动低资源语言的NLP研究。

Method: 创建涵盖多任务、多语言及不同形式的LoraxBench数据集，评估多种多语言和区域专用大模型性能。

Result: 该基准测试显示模型在印尼低资源语言上的表现明显不足，不同任务和语言之间存在差异，地区特定模型未必优于通用模型，注册变化影响模型效果。

Conclusion: LoraxBench为低资源语言的NLP研究提供了新的基准，强调了特定语言特性和注册对模型性能的影响，促使未来在低资源语言的模型优化方面探索更多。

Abstract: As one of the world's most populous countries, with 700 languages spoken,
Indonesia is behind in terms of NLP progress. We introduce LoraxBench, a
benchmark that focuses on low-resource languages of Indonesia and covers 6
diverse tasks: reading comprehension, open-domain QA, language inference,
causal reasoning, translation, and cultural QA. Our dataset covers 20
languages, with the addition of two formality registers for three languages. We
evaluate a diverse set of multilingual and region-focused LLMs and found that
this benchmark is challenging. We note a visible discrepancy between
performance in Indonesian and other languages, especially the low-resource
ones. There is no clear lead when using a region-specific model as opposed to
the general multilingual model. Lastly, we show that a change in register
affects model performance, especially with registers not commonly found in
social media, such as high-level politeness `Krama' Javanese.

Conclusion: 稀疏架构的模型规模扩展存在局限性，需进一步研究优化策略，以实现更高效的开源大模型部署。

Abstract: In August 2025, OpenAI released GPT-OSS models, its first open weight large
language models since GPT-2 in 2019, comprising two mixture of experts
architectures with 120B and 20B parameters. We evaluated both variants against
six contemporary open source large language models ranging from 14.7B to 235B
parameters, representing both dense and sparse designs, across ten benchmarks
covering general knowledge, mathematical reasoning, code generation,
multilingual understanding, and conversational ability. All models were tested
in unquantised form under standardised inference settings, with statistical
validation using McNemars test and effect size analysis. Results show that
gpt-oss-20B consistently outperforms gpt-oss-120B on several benchmarks, such
as HumanEval and MMLU, despite requiring substantially less memory and energy
per response. Both models demonstrate mid-tier overall performance within the
current open source landscape, with relative strength in code generation and
notable weaknesses in multilingual tasks. These findings provide empirical
evidence that scaling in sparse architectures may not yield proportional
performance gains, underscoring the need for further investigation into
optimisation strategies and informing more efficient model selection for future
open source deployments.

Method: 训练RoBERTa和GPT-2模型，在扰动句法和共现信息的不同数据集上观察模型的动词和名词表征变化。

Result: 模型中，句法信息缺失导致动词表征下降更显著，且对心理动词影响更大；名词则对共现信息更敏感。

Conclusion: 验证了句法启蒙在动词学习中的关键作用，为通过调整模型学习环境研究发展假设提供了方法。

Abstract: Syntactic bootstrapping (Gleitman, 1990) is the hypothesis that children use
the syntactic environments in which a verb occurs to learn its meaning. In this
paper, we examine whether large language models exhibit a similar behavior. We
do this by training RoBERTa and GPT-2 on perturbed datasets where syntactic
information is ablated. Our results show that models' verb representation
degrades more when syntactic cues are removed than when co-occurrence
information is removed. Furthermore, the representation of mental verbs, for
which syntactic bootstrapping has been shown to be particularly crucial in
human verb learning, is more negatively impacted in such training regimes than
physical verbs. In contrast, models' representation of nouns is affected more
when co-occurrences are distorted than when syntax is distorted. In addition to
reinforcing the important role of syntactic bootstrapping in verb learning, our
results demonstrated the viability of testing developmental hypotheses on a
larger scale through manipulating the learning environments of large language
models.

Result: 在多个任务中显著提升推理准确率，超越人类表现，并减少幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 显式建模因果结构能有效改善LLMs的推理表现，减缓逻辑不一致问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit logically inconsistent hallucinations
that appear coherent yet violate reasoning principles, with recent research
suggesting an inverse relationship between causal reasoning capabilities and
such hallucinations. However, existing reasoning approaches in LLMs, such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its graph-based variants, operate at the linguistic
token level rather than modeling the underlying causal relationships between
variables, lacking the ability to represent conditional independencies or
satisfy causal identification assumptions. To bridge this gap, we introduce
causal-DAG construction and reasoning (CDCR-SFT), a supervised fine-tuning
framework that trains LLMs to explicitly construct variable-level directed
acyclic graph (DAG) and then perform reasoning over it. Moreover, we present a
dataset comprising 25,368 samples (CausalDR), where each sample includes an
input question, explicit causal DAG, graph-based reasoning trace, and validated
answer. Experiments on four LLMs across eight tasks show that CDCR-SFT improves
the causal reasoning capability with the state-of-the-art 95.33% accuracy on
CLADDER (surpassing human performance of 94.8% for the first time) and reduces
the hallucination on HaluEval with 10% improvements. It demonstrates that
explicit causal structure modeling in LLMs can effectively mitigate logical
inconsistencies in LLM outputs. Code is available at

TL;DR: CorrSteer通过相关性选择特征，无需对比数据或大量激活存储，改进了大型语言模型的任务性能，展现出更高的自动化和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自动编码器（SAEs）在下游任务中的效果受限于需要对比数据或大量激活存储。

Method: 利用推理时的激活相关性来选择特征，通过平均激活自动获得操控系数，自动化整个流程。

Result: 在问答、偏见缓解、防越狱和推理基准测试中取得显著提升，如MMLU+4.1%、HarmBench+22.9%，仅用4000样本。

Conclusion: 相关性为基础的特征选择是一种有效且可扩展的自动化方法，提升了SAEs在大规模语言模型中的应用表现。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can extract interpretable features from large
language models (LLMs) without supervision. However, their effectiveness in
downstream steering tasks is limited by the requirement for contrastive
datasets or large activation storage. To address these limitations, we propose
CorrSteer, which selects features by correlating sample correctness with SAE
activations from generated tokens at inference time. This approach uses only
inference-time activations to extract more relevant features, thereby avoiding
spurious correlations. It also obtains steering coefficients from average
activations, automating the entire pipeline. Our method shows improved task
performance on QA, bias mitigation, jailbreaking prevention, and reasoning
benchmarks on Gemma 2 2B and LLaMA 3.1 8B, notably achieving a +4.1%
improvement in MMLU performance and a +22.9% improvement in HarmBench with only
4000 samples. Selected features demonstrate semantically meaningful patterns
aligned with each task's requirements, revealing the underlying capabilities
that drive performance. Our work establishes correlationbased selection as an
effective and scalable approach for automated SAE steering across language
model applications.

Conclusion: 多模态大模型结合新颖的训练策略，为自动口语评估提供了新思路，显著改善了评估效果。

Abstract: Traditional Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) systems exhibit inherent
modality limitations: text-based approaches lack acoustic information while
audio-based methods miss semantic context. Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLM) offer unprecedented opportunities for comprehensive ASA by
simultaneously processing audio and text within unified frameworks. This paper
presents a very first systematic study of MLLM for comprehensive ASA,
demonstrating the superior performance of MLLM across the aspects of content
and language use . However, assessment on the delivery aspect reveals unique
challenges, which is deemed to require specialized training strategies. We thus
propose Speech-First Multimodal Training (SFMT), leveraging a curriculum
learning principle to establish more robust modeling foundations of speech
before cross-modal synergetic fusion. A series of experiments on a benchmark
dataset show MLLM-based systems can elevate the holistic assessment performance
from a PCC value of 0.783 to 0.846. In particular, SFMT excels in the
evaluation of the delivery aspect, achieving an absolute accuracy improvement
of 4% over conventional training approaches, which also paves a new avenue for
ASA.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive fluency and task
competence in conversational settings. However, their effectiveness in
multi-session and long-term interactions is hindered by limited memory
persistence. Typical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems store
dialogue history as dense vectors, which capture semantic similarity but
neglect finer linguistic structures such as syntactic dependencies, discourse
relations, and coreference links. We propose Semantic Anchoring, a hybrid
agentic memory architecture that enriches vector-based storage with explicit
linguistic cues to improve recall of nuanced, context-rich exchanges. Our
approach combines dependency parsing, discourse relation tagging, and
coreference resolution to create structured memory entries. Experiments on
adapted long-term dialogue datasets show that semantic anchoring improves
factual recall and discourse coherence by up to 18% over strong RAG baselines.
We further conduct ablation studies, human evaluations, and error analysis to
assess robustness and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在性能与效率之间的权衡问题。

Method: 采用基于查询嵌入和聚类的测试时路由，将不同容量模型进行集成，根据性能-效率得分动态分配查询。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Avengers-Pro超越单一最佳模型，提升准确率同时显著降低成本，达到了Pareto最优。

Conclusion: 通过多模型集成与智能路由机制，有效平衡了大模型的性能与成本，提供了优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Balancing performance and efficiency is a central challenge in large language
model (LLM) advancement. GPT-5 addresses this with test-time routing,
dynamically assigning queries to either an efficient or a high-capacity model
during inference. In this work, we present Avengers-Pro, a test-time routing
framework that ensembles LLMs of varying capacities and efficiencies, providing
a unified solution for all performance-efficiency tradeoffs. The Avengers-Pro
embeds and clusters incoming queries, then routes each to the most suitable
model based on a performance-efficiency score. Across 6 challenging benchmarks
and 8 leading models -- including GPT-5-medium, Gemini-2.5-pro, and
Claude-opus-4.1 -- Avengers-Pro achieves state-of-the-art results: by varying a
performance-efficiency trade-off parameter, it can surpass the strongest single
model (GPT-5-medium) by +7% in average accuracy. Moreover, it can match the
average accuracy of the strongest single model at 27% lower cost, and reach
~90% of that performance at 63% lower cost. Last but not least, it achieves a
Pareto frontier, consistently yielding the highest accuracy for any given cost,
and the lowest cost for any given accuracy, among all single models. Code is

Result: LIFE在检测LLM生成的假新闻中达到了最先进的效果，并同样适用于人工撰写的假新闻。

Conclusion: LIFE依靠提示引起的统计性语言学指纹，有效提升假新闻检测的准确性与可靠性。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models, the generation of fake
news has become increasingly effortless, posing a growing societal threat and
underscoring the urgent need for reliable detection methods. Early efforts to
identify LLM-generated fake news have predominantly focused on the textual
content itself; however, because much of that content may appear coherent and
factually consistent, the subtle traces of falsification are often difficult to
uncover. Through distributional divergence analysis, we uncover prompt-induced
linguistic fingerprints: statistically distinct probability shifts between
LLM-generated real and fake news when maliciously prompted. Based on this
insight, we propose a novel method named Linguistic Fingerprints Extraction
(LIFE). By reconstructing word-level probability distributions, LIFE can find
discriminative patterns that facilitate the detection of LLM-generated fake
news. To further amplify these fingerprint patterns, we also leverage
key-fragment techniques that accentuate subtle linguistic differences, thereby
improving detection reliability. Our experiments show that LIFE achieves
state-of-the-art performance in LLM-generated fake news and maintains high
performance in human-written fake news. The code and data are available at

Conclusion: 合成代码混合训练有效弥合了不同资源语言在大模型中的性能差距，推动多语言公平性。

Abstract: Cutting-edge LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for multilingual
communication and understanding. However, LLMs perform worse in Common Sense
Reasoning (CSR) tasks when prompted in low-resource languages (LRLs) like Hindi
or Swahili compared to high-resource languages (HRLs) like English. Equalizing
this inconsistent access to quality LLM outputs is crucial to ensure fairness
for speakers of LRLs and across diverse linguistic communities. In this paper,
we propose an approach to bridge this gap in LLM performance. Our approach
involves fine-tuning an LLM on synthetic code-switched text generated using
controlled language-mixing methods. We empirically demonstrate that fine-tuning
LLMs on synthetic code-switched datasets leads to substantial improvements in
LRL model performance while preserving or enhancing performance in HRLs.
Additionally, we present a new dataset of synthetic code-switched text derived
from the CommonSenseQA dataset, featuring three distinct language ratio
configurations.

Result: 少样本提示策略优于零样本，游戏化评估展现了模型的动态情感推理潜能。

Conclusion: 大规模语言模型在情感推理任务中具有广阔应用前景，尤其在动态交互环境中表现出色。

Abstract: This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
predicting human-perceived misery scores from natural language descriptions of
real-world scenarios. The task is framed as a regression problem, where the
model assigns a scalar value from 0 to 100 to each input statement. We evaluate
multiple prompting strategies, including zero-shot, fixed-context few-shot, and
retrieval-based prompting using BERT sentence embeddings. Few-shot approaches
consistently outperform zero-shot baselines, underscoring the value of
contextual examples in affective prediction. To move beyond static evaluation,
we introduce the "Misery Game Show", a novel gamified framework inspired by a
television format. It tests LLMs through structured rounds involving ordinal
comparison, binary classification, scalar estimation, and feedback-driven
reasoning. This setup enables us to assess not only predictive accuracy but
also the model's ability to adapt based on corrective feedback. The gamified
evaluation highlights the broader potential of LLMs in dynamic emotional
reasoning tasks beyond standard regression. Code and data link:

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种创新的多轮对话生成方案，有助于推动智能对话系统的发展。

Abstract: Agentic task-solving with Large Language Models (LLMs) requires multi-turn,
multi-step interactions, often involving complex function calls and dynamic
user-agent exchanges. Existing simulation-based data generation methods for
such scenarios rely heavily on costly autoregressive interactions between
multiple LLM agents, thereby limiting real-world performance of agentic tasks.
In this paper, we propose a novel Non-Autoregressive Iterative Generation
framework, called ToolACE-MT, for constructing high-quality multi-turn agentic
dialogues. ToolACE-MT generates full conversational trajectories through three
stages: coarse-grained initialization, iterative refinement, and offline
verification. The initialization phase builds a structurally complete yet
semantically coarse dialogue skeleton; the iterative refinement phase
introduces realistic complexities and continued refinement via mask-and-fill
operations; and the offline verification phase ensures correctness and
coherence via rule- and model-based checks. Experiments demonstrate that
ToolACE-MT enables efficient, effective and generalizable agentic data
generation, offering a new paradigm for high-quality data construction in
tool-augmented LLM scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many natural
language tasks but still struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning,
particularly across diverse disciplines. Existing reasoning datasets often
either lack disciplinary breadth or the structural depth necessary to elicit
robust reasoning behaviors. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd
Reasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive
raw documents (book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinary
challenging questions. A core innovation of our approach is the introduction of
a Design Logic concept, which mimics the question-creation process of human
educators. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design
logics from existing questions across various disciplines. By matching these
design logics with disciplinary source materials, we are able to create
reasoning questions that far surpass the difficulty and diversity of existing
datasets. Based on this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning
datasets that span 75 disciplines: Design-Logic-Reasoning-Book (DLR-Book),
containing 3.04 million challenging questions synthesized from the book corpus,
and Design-Logic-Reasoning-Web (DLR-Web), with 1.66 million challenging
questions from the web corpus. Our data analysis demonstrates that the
questions synthesized by our method exhibit substantially greater difficulty
and diversity than those in the baseline datasets. We validate the
effectiveness of these datasets by conducting SFT experiments on the
Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-4B-Base models. The results show that our dataset
significantly outperforms existing multidisciplinary datasets of the same
volume. Training with the full datasets further enables the models to surpass
the multidisciplinary reasoning performance of the official Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-4B models.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在全球的广泛应用，确保其在多语言和跨文化背景下的安全性变得尤为重要，现有的多语言安全评估不足以支持这一需求。

Method: 开发了LinguaSafe数据集，包括45k条多语言数据，结合翻译、改编和本土数据，设计了多维度、安全性评估框架。

Result: 评估显示各语言间安全性表现差异显著，为未来多语言安全性优化提供了评估工具。

Conclusion: LinguaSafe促进了多语言环境下的安全性研究，为实现更全面的安全对齐提供数据和工具。

Abstract: The widespread adoption and increasing prominence of large language models
(LLMs) in global technologies necessitate a rigorous focus on ensuring their
safety across a diverse range of linguistic and cultural contexts. The lack of
a comprehensive evaluation and diverse data in existing multilingual safety
evaluations for LLMs limits their effectiveness, hindering the development of
robust multilingual safety alignment. To address this critical gap, we
introduce LinguaSafe, a comprehensive multilingual safety benchmark crafted
with meticulous attention to linguistic authenticity. The LinguaSafe dataset
comprises 45k entries in 12 languages, ranging from Hungarian to Malay. Curated
using a combination of translated, transcreated, and natively-sourced data, our
dataset addresses the critical need for multilingual safety evaluations of
LLMs, filling the void in the safety evaluation of LLMs across diverse
under-represented languages from Hungarian to Malay. LinguaSafe presents a
multidimensional and fine-grained evaluation framework, with direct and
indirect safety assessments, including further evaluations for oversensitivity.
The results of safety and helpfulness evaluations vary significantly across
different domains and different languages, even in languages with similar
resource levels. Our benchmark provides a comprehensive suite of metrics for
in-depth safety evaluation, underscoring the critical importance of thoroughly
assessing multilingual safety in LLMs to achieve more balanced safety
alignment. Our dataset and code are released to the public to facilitate
further research in the field of multilingual LLM safety.

Result: 在SpiderUnion和BirdUnion两个大规模跨领域基准测试中达到SOTA，验证了其有效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: CRED-SQL通过引入中间语言和集群检索，有效改善大规模Database中的语义匹配问题，提升Text-to-SQL系统性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved
the accuracy of Text-to-SQL systems. However, a critical challenge remains: the
semantic mismatch between natural language questions (NLQs) and their
corresponding SQL queries. This issue is exacerbated in large-scale databases,
where semantically similar attributes hinder schema linking and semantic drift
during SQL generation, ultimately reducing model accuracy. To address these
challenges, we introduce CRED-SQL, a framework designed for large-scale
databases that integrates Cluster Retrieval and Execution Description. CRED-SQL
first performs cluster-based large-scale schema retrieval to pinpoint the
tables and columns most relevant to a given NLQ, alleviating schema mismatch.
It then introduces an intermediate natural language representation-Execution
Description Language (EDL)-to bridge the gap between NLQs and SQL. This
reformulation decomposes the task into two stages: Text-to-EDL and EDL-to-SQL,
leveraging LLMs' strong general reasoning capabilities while reducing semantic
deviation. Extensive experiments on two large-scale, cross-domain
benchmarks-SpiderUnion and BirdUnion-demonstrate that CRED-SQL achieves new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating its effectiveness and
scalability. Our code is available at https://github.com/smduan/CRED-SQL.git

Abstract: In this paper, we present the SALAMANDRATA family of models, an improved
iteration of SALAMANDRA LLMs (Gonzalez-Agirre et al., 2025) specifically
trained to achieve strong performance in translation-related tasks for 38
European languages. SALAMANDRATA comes in two scales: 2B and 7B parameters. For
both versions, we applied the same training recipe with a first step of
continual pre-training on parallel data, and a second step of supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality instructions. The BSC submission to the WMT25
General Machine Translation shared task is based on the 7B variant of
SALAMANDRATA. We first adapted the model vocabulary to support the additional
non-European languages included in the task. This was followed by a second
phase of continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, carefully designed
to optimize performance across all translation directions for this year's
shared task. For decoding, we employed two quality-aware strategies: Minimum
Bayes Risk Decoding and Tuned Re-ranking using COMET and COMET-KIWI
respectively. We publicly release both the 2B and 7B versions of SALAMANDRATA,
along with the newer SALAMANDRATA-V2 model, on Hugging Face1

Motivation: 现有Med-LVLMs在实际应用中存在事实不准确和输出不可靠的问题，亟需改进。

Method: 构建MedAtlas知识库，设计异质性知识增强框架HeteroRAG，包括模态特定CLIP和多语料查询生成器，并通过偏好调优实现跨模态、多源知识整合。

Result: 在12个数据集和3种模态上，HeteroRAG显著优于现有方法，提升模型的事实性和可靠性。

Conclusion: HeteroRAG有效解决了医疗多模态模型中的知识整合难题，推动了医疗AI的实际应用发展。

Abstract: Medical large vision-language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown promise in
clinical applications but suffer from factual inaccuracies and unreliable
outputs, posing risks in real-world diagnostics. While retrieval-augmented
generation has emerged as a potential solution, current medical multimodal RAG
systems are unable to perform effective retrieval across heterogeneous sources.
The irrelevance of retrieved reports affects the factuality of analysis, while
insufficient knowledge affects the credibility of clinical decision-making. To
bridge the gap, we construct MedAtlas, which includes extensive multimodal
report repositories and diverse text corpora. Based on it, we present
HeteroRAG, a novel framework that enhances Med-LVLMs through heterogeneous
knowledge sources. The framework introduces Modality-specific CLIPs for
effective report retrieval and a Multi-corpora Query Generator for dynamically
constructing queries for diverse corpora. Incorporating knowledge from such
multifaceted sources, Med-LVLM is then trained with Heterogeneous Knowledge
Preference Tuning to achieve cross-modality and multi-source knowledge
alignment. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 modalities
demonstrate that the proposed HeteroRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance
in most medical vision language benchmarks, significantly improving factual
accuracy and reliability of Med-LVLMs.

Conclusion: Atomic Thought和Atom-Searcher创新性融合细粒度推理与强化学习策略，有效改善大模型复杂推理能力，推动AI推理研究的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable problem-solving abilities,
but struggle with complex tasks due to static internal knowledge.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances access to external information,
yet remains limited in multi-hop reasoning and strategic search due to rigid
workflows. Recent advancements in agentic deep research empower LLMs to
autonomously reason, search, and synthesize information. However, current
approaches relying on outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) face critical
issues such as conflicting gradients and reward sparsity, limiting performance
gains and training efficiency. To address these, we first propose Atomic
Thought, a novel LLM thinking paradigm that decomposes reasoning into
fine-grained functional units. These units are supervised by Reasoning Reward
Models (RRMs), which provide Atomic Thought Rewards (ATR) for fine-grained
guidance. Building on this, we propose Atom-Searcher, a novel RL framework for
agentic deep research that integrates Atomic Thought and ATR. Atom-Searcher
uses a curriculum-inspired reward schedule, prioritizing process-level ATR
early and transitioning to outcome rewards, accelerating convergence on
effective reasoning paths. Experiments on seven benchmarks show consistent
improvements over the state-of-the-art. Key advantages include: (1)
Atom-Searcher scales computation at test-time. (2) Atomic Thought provides
supervision anchors for RRMs, bridging deep research tasks and RRMs. (3)
Atom-Searcher exhibits more interpretable, human-like reasoning patterns.

Motivation: 质疑高资源标准语言对相关低资源变体建模的有益设想，探索标准语言在模型中的主导作用是否带来负面影响。

Method: 提出一种在线变分探测框架，通过实时估计标准变体的子空间，并进行空间解耦，以减少其在模型中的主导作用。

Result: 在阿拉伯语方言生成中，干预提升了生成质量，最高提升4.9 chrF++，平均提升2.0，同时观察到标准语性能的略有下降。

Conclusion: 高资源变体的主导地位可能限制低资源变体的生成能力，采用空间干预的方法可以缓解这一问题，为多语种模型的空间分配提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Alignment with high-resource standard languages is often assumed to aid the
modeling of related low-resource varieties. We challenge this assumption by
demonstrating that excessive representational entanglement with a dominant
variety, such as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) in relation to Arabic dialects,
can actively hinder generative modeling. We present the first comprehensive
causal study of this phenomenon by analyzing and directly intervening in the
internal representation geometry of large language models (LLMs). Our key
contribution is an online variational probing framework that continuously
estimates the subspace of the standard variety during fine-tuning, enabling
projection-based decoupling from this space. While our study uses Arabic as a
case due to its unusually rich parallel resources across 25 dialects, the
broader motivation is methodological: dialectal MT serves as a controlled proxy
for generative tasks where comparable multi-variety corpora are unavailable.
Across 25 dialects, our intervention improves generation quality by up to +4.9
chrF++ and +2.0 on average compared to standard fine-tuning, despite a measured
tradeoff in standard-language performance. These results provide causal
evidence that subspace dominance by high-resource varieties can restrict
generative capacity for related varieties. More generally, we unify geometric
and information-theoretic probing with subspace-level causal interventions,
offering practical tools for improving generative modeling in closely related
language families and, more broadly, for controlling representational
allocation in multilingual and multi-domain LLMs. Code will be released.

the DinG corpus, consisting of transcripts of spontaneous French dialogues
recorded during the board game Catan. As AMR has insufficient coverage of the
dynamics of spontaneous speech, we extend the framework to better represent
spontaneous speech and sentence structures specific to French. Additionally, to
support consistent annotation, we provide an annotation guideline detailing
these extensions. We publish our corpus under a free license (CC-SA-BY). We
also train and evaluate an AMR parser on our data. This model can be used as an
assistance annotation tool to provide initial annotations that can be refined
by human annotators. Our work contributes to the development of semantic
resources for French dialogue.

Abstract: Abusive language detection has become an increasingly important task as a
means to tackle this type of harmful content in social media. There has been a
substantial body of research developing models for determining if a social
media post is abusive or not; however, this research has primarily focused on
exploiting social media posts individually, overlooking additional context that
can be derived from surrounding posts. In this study, we look at conversational
exchanges, where a user replies to an earlier post by another user (the parent
tweet). We ask: does leveraging context from the parent tweet help determine if
a reply post is abusive or not, and what are the features that contribute the
most? We study a range of content-based and account-based features derived from
the context, and compare this to the more widely studied approach of only
looking at the features from the reply tweet. For a more generalizable study,
we test four different classification models on a dataset made of
conversational exchanges (parent-reply tweet pairs) with replies labeled as
abusive or not. Our experiments show that incorporating contextual features
leads to substantial improvements compared to the use of features derived from
the reply tweet only, confirming the importance of leveraging context. We
observe that, among the features under study, it is especially the
content-based features (what is being posted) that contribute to the
classification performance rather than account-based features (who is posting

different features to ensure improved performance over being more selective and
using fewer features. Our study provides insights into the development of
contextualized abusive language detection models in realistic settings

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索早期学术传统中文学作品的编辑过程及其形成机制，弥补史料缺乏的研究空白。

Method: 应用风格分析、频繁词、词性标签和伪后缀的自动识别技术，结合拼写识别（HTR）和转化器基础的光学字符识别，分析手工和自动提取的文本数据。

Result: 若成功，将验证自动化技术在学术拉丁文本中的适用性，提供可复用的研究模版，丰富关于中世纪大学合作文学创作的理解。

Conclusion: 该研究将推动计算方法在学术传统研究中的应用，为中世纪学术文本的分析提供创新工具与路径。

Abstract: While the indirect evidence suggests that already in the early scholastic
period the literary production based on records of oral teaching (so-called
reportationes) was not uncommon, there are very few sources commenting on the
practice. This paper details the design of a study applying stylometric
techniques of authorship attribution to a collection developed from
reportationes -- Stephen Langton's Quaestiones Theologiae -- aiming to uncover
layers of editorial work and thus validate some hypotheses regarding the
collection's formation. Following Camps, Cl\'erice, and Pinche (2021), I
discuss the implementation of an HTR pipeline and stylometric analysis based on
the most frequent words, POS tags, and pseudo-affixes. The proposed study will
offer two methodological gains relevant to computational research on the
scholastic tradition: it will directly compare performance on manually composed
and automatically extracted data, and it will test the validity of
transformer-based OCR and automated transcription alignment for workflows
applied to scholastic Latin corpora. If successful, this study will provide an
easily reusable template for the exploratory analysis of collaborative literary
production stemming from medieval universities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究transformer模型中词语含义的表示方式，是否类似于词汇存储。

Method: 提取RoBERTa-base的词向量空间，并采用k-means聚类，手动和量化分析聚类中包含的语义信息。

Result: 发现词向量空间编码了多种语义信息，包括感情色彩、具体性、象征性、禁忌性和习得年龄，反驳了模型不具备语义存储的观点。

Conclusion: transformer模型的词向量具有丰富的语义内容，支持其在语义理解方面的能力。

Abstract: We investigate how word meanings are represented in the transformer language
models. Specifically, we focus on whether transformer models employ something
analogous to a lexical store - where each word has an entry that contains
semantic information. To do this, we extracted the token embedding space of
RoBERTa-base and k-means clustered it into 200 clusters. In our first study, we
then manually inspected the resultant clusters to consider whether they are
sensitive to semantic information. In our second study, we tested whether the
clusters are sensitive to five psycholinguistic measures: valence,
concreteness, iconicity, taboo, and age of acquisition. Overall, our findings
were very positive - there is a wide variety of semantic information encoded
within the token embedding space. This serves to rule out certain "meaning
eliminativist" hypotheses about how transformer LLMs process semantic
information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂表格在语义注释中面临的信息丢失、层级复杂、同义词、拼写错误和缩写等挑战。

Method: 设计五个针对不同场景的外部工具，使用ReAct框架动态选择策略，并利用Levenshtein距离优化注释流程。

Result: 在两个挑战数据集上实现优于现有方法的性能，时间成本降低70%，LLM token使用减少60%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了复杂表格的语义注释效率和准确性，为STA提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The Semantic Table Annotation (STA) task, which includes Column Type
Annotation (CTA) and Cell Entity Annotation (CEA), maps table contents to
ontology entities and plays important roles in various semantic applications.
However, complex tables often pose challenges such as semantic loss of column
names or cell values, strict ontological hierarchy requirements, homonyms,
spelling errors, and abbreviations, which hinder annotation accuracy. To
address these issues, this paper proposes an LLM-based agent approach for CTA
and CEA. We design and implement five external tools with tailored prompts
based on the ReAct framework, enabling the STA agent to dynamically select
suitable annotation strategies depending on table characteristics. Experiments
are conducted on the Tough Tables and BiodivTab datasets from the SemTab
challenge, which contain the aforementioned challenges. Our method outperforms
existing approaches across various metrics. Furthermore, by leveraging
Levenshtein distance to reduce redundant annotations, we achieve a 70%
reduction in time costs and a 60% reduction in LLM token usage, providing an
efficient and cost-effective solution for STA.

Motivation: 现有自我优化方法依赖固定次数，难以根据上下文动态调整，影响性能。

Method: 引入主动决策机制，让模型依据内部状态和上下文自主选择是否细化回应内容。

Result: 在多个任务中，PASR降低了约41.6%的令牌消耗，同时提升了8.2%的准确率。

Conclusion: PASR有效提高了大模型的生成效率和准确性，验证了其在多任务环境中的适用性与优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in self-refinement have demonstrated significant potential
for improving the outputs of large language models (LLMs) through iterative
refinement. However, most existing self-refinement methods rely on a reactive
process with a fixed number of iterations, making it difficult to determine the
optimal timing and content of refinement based on the evolving generation
context. Inspired by the way humans dynamically refine their thoughts during
execution, we propose ProActive Self-Refinement (PASR), a novel method that
enables LLMs to refine their outputs during the generation process. Unlike
methods that regenerate entire responses, PASR proactively decides whether,
when, and how to refine based on the model's internal state and evolving
context. We conduct extensive experiments on a diverse set of 10 tasks to
evaluate the effectiveness of PASR. Experimental results show that PASR
significantly enhances problem-solving performance. In particular, on Qwen3-8B,
PASR reduces average token consumption by 41.6 percent compared to standard
generation, while also achieving an 8.2 percent improvement in accuracy. Our
code and all baselines used in the paper are available in the GitHub.

Result: 信息共享显著降低幻觉错误，协调者提升任务成功率，组合策略提升到25%。

Conclusion: 结构化信息共享和反思式协调为多智能体系统在复杂长时间规划中取得显著效果的关键。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MASs) have pushed the boundaries of large language model
(LLM) agents in domains such as web research and software engineering. However,
long-horizon, multi-constraint planning tasks involve conditioning on detailed
information and satisfying complex interdependent constraints, which can pose a
challenge for these systems. In this study, we construct an LLM-based MAS for a
travel planning task which is representative of these challenges. We evaluate
the impact of a notebook to facilitate information sharing, and evaluate an
orchestrator agent to improve coordination in free form conversation between
agents. We find that the notebook reduces errors due to hallucinated details by
18%, while an orchestrator directs the MAS to focus on and further reduce
errors by up to 13.5% within focused sub-areas. Combining both mechanisms
achieves a 25% final pass rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, a 17.5% absolute
improvement over the single-agent baseline's 7.5% pass rate. These results
highlight the potential of structured information sharing and reflective
orchestration as key components in MASs for long horizon planning with LLMs.

Abstract: LLM-based web agents have the potential to automate long-running web tasks,
such as finding offers for specific products in multiple online shops and
subsequently ordering the cheapest products that meet the users needs. This
paper introduces WebMall, a multi-shop online shopping benchmark for evaluating
the effectiveness and efficiency of web agents for comparison-shopping. WebMall
consists of four simulated online shops populated with authentic product offers
sourced from the Common Crawl, alongside a suite of 91 cross-shop tasks. These
tasks include basic tasks such as finding specific products in multiple shops,
performing price comparisons, adding items to the shopping cart, and completing
checkout. Advanced tasks involve searching for products based on vague
requirements, identifying suitable substitutes, and finding compatible
products. Compared to existing e-commerce benchmarks, such as WebShop or
ShoppingBench, WebMall introduces comparison-shopping tasks across multiple
shops. Furthermore, the product offers are more heterogeneous, as they
originate from hundreds of distinct real-world shops. The tasks in WebMall
require longer interaction trajectories than those in WebShop, while remaining
representative of real-world shopping behaviors. We evaluate eight baseline
agents on WebMall, varying in observation modality, memory utilization, and
underlying large language model (GPT 4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4). The
best-performing configurations achieve completion rates of 75% and 53%, and F1
scores of 87% and 63%, on the basic and advanced task sets, respectively.
WebMall is publicly released to facilitate research on web agents and to
promote advancements in navigation, reasoning, and efficiency within e-commerce
scenarios.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效改善讽刺语音合成的表现，为相关应用提供技术支持。

Abstract: Sarcastic speech synthesis, which involves generating speech that effectively
conveys sarcasm, is essential for enhancing natural interactions in
applications such as entertainment and human-computer interaction. However,
synthesizing sarcastic speech remains a challenge due to the nuanced prosody
that characterizes sarcasm, as well as the limited availability of annotated
sarcastic speech data. To address these challenges, this study introduces a
novel approach that integrates feedback loss from a bi-modal sarcasm detection
model into the TTS training process, enhancing the model's ability to capture
and convey sarcasm. In addition, by leveraging transfer learning, a speech
synthesis model pre-trained on read speech undergoes a two-stage fine-tuning
process. First, it is fine-tuned on a diverse dataset encompassing various
speech styles, including sarcastic speech. In the second stage, the model is
further refined using a dataset focused specifically on sarcastic speech,
enhancing its ability to generate sarcasm-aware speech. Objective and
subjective evaluations demonstrate that our proposed methods improve the
quality, naturalness, and sarcasm-awareness of synthesized speech.

Result: 在多个基础模型上实现了优异的性能，尤其在GSM8K数据集上取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 多模型交互与思维模拟方法有效增强小模型的数学推理能力，达到了SOTA效果。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) have
strong mathematical reasoning abilities but rely on hundreds of billions of
parameters. To tackle the challenge of poor reasoning in Small Language Models
(SLMs), existing methods typically leverage LLMs to generate massive amounts of
data for cramming training. In psychology, they are akin to System 1 thinking,
which resolves reasoning problems rapidly based on experience and intuition.
However, human learning also requires System 2 thinking, where knowledge is
first acquired and then reinforced through practice. Inspired by such two
distinct modes of thinking, we propose a novel method based on the multi-LoRA
Interaction for mathematical reasoning Distillation (LoRID). First, we input
the question and reasoning of each sample into an LLM to create
knowledge-enhanced datasets. Subsequently, we train a LoRA block on the student
model as an Intuitive Reasoner (IR), which directly generates Chain-of-Thoughts
for problem-solving. Then, to imitate System 2 thinking, we train the Knowledge
Generator (KG) and Deep Reasoner (DR), respectively. The former outputs only
knowledge after receiving problems, while the latter uses that knowledge to
perform reasoning. Finally, to address the randomness in the generation of IR
and DR, we evaluate whether their outputs are consistent, and the inference
process needs to be iterated if not. This step can enhance the mathematical
reasoning ability of SLMs through mutual feedback. Experimental results show
that LoRID achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially on the GSM8K
dataset, where it outperforms the second-best method by 2.3%, 16.1%, 2.4%,
12.3%, and 1.8% accuracy across the five base models, respectively.

Abstract: Language models have made significant advancements in understanding and
generating human language, achieving remarkable success in various
applications. However, evaluating these models remains a challenge,
particularly for resource-limited languages like Turkish. To address this
issue, we introduce the Turkish MMLU (TR-MMLU) benchmark, a comprehensive
evaluation framework designed to assess the linguistic and conceptual
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in Turkish. TR-MMLU is based on a
meticulously curated dataset comprising 6,200 multiple-choice questions across
62 sections within the Turkish education system. This benchmark provides a
standard framework for Turkish NLP research, enabling detailed analyses of
LLMs' capabilities in processing Turkish text. In this study, we evaluated
state-of-the-art LLMs on TR-MMLU, highlighting areas for improvement in model
design. TR-MMLU sets a new standard for advancing Turkish NLP research and
inspiring future innovations.

Conclusion: 提出的评估框架能建立针对形态复杂语言的分词标准，强调定制化Tokenization的重要性。

Abstract: Tokenization is a fundamental preprocessing step in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), significantly impacting the capability of large language
models (LLMs) to capture linguistic and semantic nuances. This study introduces
a novel evaluation framework addressing tokenization challenges specific to
morphologically-rich and low-resource languages such as Turkish. Utilizing the
Turkish MMLU (TR-MMLU) dataset, comprising 6,200 multiple-choice questions from
the Turkish education system, we assessed tokenizers based on vocabulary size,
token count, processing time, language-specific token percentages (\%TR), and
token purity (\%Pure). These newly proposed metrics measure how effectively
tokenizers preserve linguistic structures. Our analysis reveals that
language-specific token percentages exhibit a stronger correlation with
downstream performance (e.g., MMLU scores) than token purity. Furthermore,
increasing model parameters alone does not necessarily enhance linguistic
performance, underscoring the importance of tailored, language-specific
tokenization methods. The proposed framework establishes robust and practical
tokenization standards for morphologically complex languages.

Abstract: The Simon Fraser University Speech Error Database (SFUSED) is a public data
collection developed for linguistic and psycholinguistic research. Here we
demonstrate how its design and annotations can be used to test and evaluate
speech recognition models. The database comprises systematically annotated
speech errors from spontaneous English speech, with each error tagged for
intended and actual error productions. The annotation schema incorporates
multiple classificatory dimensions that are of some value to model assessment,
including linguistic hierarchical level, contextual sensitivity, degraded
words, word corrections, and both word-level and syllable-level error
positioning. To assess the value of these classificatory variables, we
evaluated the transcription accuracy of WhisperX across 5,300 documented word
and phonological errors. This analysis demonstrates the atabase's effectiveness
as a diagnostic tool for ASR system performance.

Conclusion: 自适应生成顺序能显著增强语言模型的推理和规划能力，ReCOR框架有效实现此目标。

Abstract: Modern causal language models, followed by rapid developments in discrete
diffusion models, can now produce a wide variety of interesting and useful
content. However, these families of models are predominantly trained to output
tokens with a fixed (left-to-right) or random order, which may deviate from the
logical order in which tokens are generated originally. In this paper, we
observe that current causal and diffusion models encounter difficulties in
problems that require adaptive token generation orders to solve tractably,
which we characterize with the $\mathcal{V}$-information framework. Motivated
by this, we propose Reinforced Context Order Recovery (ReCOR), a
reinforcement-learning-based framework to extract adaptive, data-dependent
token generation orders from text data without annotations. Self-supervised by
token prediction statistics, ReCOR estimates the hardness of predicting every
unfilled token and adaptively selects the next token during both training and
inference. Experiments on challenging reasoning and planning datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of ReCOR compared with baselines,
sometimes outperforming oracle models supervised with the ground-truth order.

Abstract: Existing document-level machine translation resources are only available for
a handful of languages, mostly high-resourced ones. To facilitate the training
and evaluation of document-level translation and, more broadly, long-context
modeling for global communities, we create DocHPLT, the largest publicly
available document-level translation dataset to date. It contains 124 million
aligned document pairs across 50 languages paired with English, comprising 4.26
billion sentences, with further possibility to provide 2500 bonus pairs not
involving English. Unlike previous reconstruction-based approaches that piece
together documents from sentence-level data, we modify an existing web
extraction pipeline to preserve complete document integrity from the source,
retaining all content including unaligned portions. After our preliminary
experiments identify the optimal training context strategy for document-level
translation, we demonstrate that LLMs fine-tuned on DocHPLT substantially
outperform off-the-shelf instruction-tuned baselines, with particularly
dramatic improvements for under-resourced languages. We open-source the dataset
under a permissive license, providing essential infrastructure for advancing
multilingual document-level translation.

Motivation: 弥补大语言模型在网络安全应急响应中因缺乏外部知识导致的推理能力不足。

Method: 在AutoBnB框架基础上引入检索机制，结合不同数据源（技术文档和事件报告）设置检索环境，通过模拟真实场景验证其效果。

Result: 检索增强显著提升了多组织模型中的决策质量和成功率，验证了其在复杂多阶段攻击中的实用性。

Conclusion: 整合检索机制的多智能体系统增强了网络安全应急响应的效果，展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Incident response (IR) requires fast, coordinated, and well-informed
decision-making to contain and mitigate cyber threats. While large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise as autonomous agents in simulated IR settings,
their reasoning is often limited by a lack of access to external knowledge. In
this work, we present AutoBnB-RAG, an extension of the AutoBnB framework that
incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into multi-agent incident
response simulations. Built on the Backdoors & Breaches (B&B) tabletop game
environment, AutoBnB-RAG enables agents to issue retrieval queries and
incorporate external evidence during collaborative investigations. We introduce
two retrieval settings: one grounded in curated technical documentation
(RAG-Wiki), and another using narrative-style incident reports (RAG-News). We
evaluate performance across eight team structures, including newly introduced
argumentative configurations designed to promote critical reasoning. To
validate practical utility, we also simulate real-world cyber incidents based
on public breach reports, demonstrating AutoBnB-RAG's ability to reconstruct
complex multi-stage attacks. Our results show that retrieval augmentation
improves decision quality and success rates across diverse organizational
models. This work demonstrates the value of integrating retrieval mechanisms
into LLM-based multi-agent systems for cybersecurity decision-making.

Motivation: 解决现有研究未探讨的联系中心操作偏差问题，以改善摘要的公平性和质量。

Method: 建立包括15个操作偏差维度的分类体系，利用LLM零样本分类实现偏差检测，采用Fidelity Gap和Coverage两指标进行偏差量化。

Result: 分析显示所有模型都存在系统性偏差，偏差与模型规模和类型无关。

Conclusion: 偏差普遍存在，需进一步研究以改善模型公平性和操作质量。

Abstract: Abstractive summarization is a core application in contact centers, where
Large Language Models (LLMs) generate millions of summaries of call transcripts
daily. Despite their apparent quality, it remains unclear whether LLMs
systematically under- or over-attend to specific aspects of the transcript,
potentially introducing biases in the generated summary. While prior work has
examined social and positional biases, the specific forms of bias pertinent to
contact center operations - which we term Operational Bias - have remained
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce BlindSpot, a framework built upon
a taxonomy of 15 operational bias dimensions (e.g., disfluency, speaker, topic)
for the identification and quantification of these biases. BlindSpot leverages
an LLM as a zero-shot classifier to derive categorical distributions for each
bias dimension in a pair of transcript and its summary. The bias is then
quantified using two metrics: Fidelity Gap (the JS Divergence between
distributions) and Coverage (the percentage of source labels omitted). Using
BlindSpot, we conducted an empirical study with 2500 real call transcripts and
their summaries generated by 20 LLMs of varying scales and families (e.g., GPT,
Llama, Claude). Our analysis reveals that biases are systemic and present
across all evaluated models, regardless of size or family.

Abstract: Commonsense validation evaluates whether a sentence aligns with everyday
human understanding, a critical capability for developing robust natural
language understanding systems. While substantial progress has been made in
English, the task remains underexplored in Arabic, particularly given its rich
linguistic diversity. Existing Arabic resources have primarily focused on
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), leaving regional dialects underrepresented
despite their prevalence in spoken contexts. To bridge this gap, we present two
key contributions: (i) we introduce MuDRiC, an extended Arabic commonsense
dataset incorporating multiple dialects, and (ii) a novel method adapting Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to Arabic commonsense reasoning, which enhances
semantic relationship modeling for improved commonsense validation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves superior
performance in Arabic commonsense validation. Our work enhances Arabic natural
language understanding by providing both a foundational dataset and a novel
method for handling its complex variations. To the best of our knowledge, we
release the first Arabic multi-dialect commonsense reasoning dataset.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决后训练模型中水印检测效果有限的问题，寻找更有效的检测方案。

Result: 混合检测方案在多种实验条件下表现优于单一检测方法。

Conclusion: 多方法结合能显著提升大语言模型文本检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Watermarking has recently emerged as an effective strategy for detecting the
generations of large language models (LLMs). The strength of a watermark
typically depends strongly on the entropy afforded by the language model and
the set of input prompts. However, entropy can be quite limited in practice,
especially for models that are post-trained, for example via instruction tuning
or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which makes detection
based on watermarking alone challenging. In this work, we investigate whether
detection can be improved by combining watermark detectors with non-watermark
ones. We explore a number of hybrid schemes that combine the two, observing
performance gains over either class of detector under a wide range of
experimental conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一个联合评估思维过度与欠思维的基准，显示当前模型难以实现两者的平衡，强调需要发展更优的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前存在两类大型语言模型：思考型和非思考型，它们在复杂性任务上表现不同，但缺乏统一的评估与优化。

Method: 设计了OptimalThinkingBench基准，包括两个子基准，使用新颖的准确率指标进行模型评估，并探索优化思维平衡的方法。

Result: 多数模型无法在基准上实现最优思维，思考型模型常过度思考，非思考型模型欠思考，优化方法存在折中问题。

Conclusion: 未来需研发更统一、更平衡的模型，以兼顾性能与效率。

Abstract: Thinking LLMs solve complex tasks at the expense of increased compute and
overthinking on simpler problems, while non-thinking LLMs are faster and
cheaper but underthink on harder reasoning problems. This has led to the
development of separate thinking and non-thinking LLM variants, leaving the
onus of selecting the optimal model for each query on the end user. In this
work, we introduce OptimalThinkingBench, a unified benchmark that jointly
evaluates overthinking and underthinking in LLMs and also encourages the
development of optimally-thinking models that balance performance and
efficiency. Our benchmark comprises two sub-benchmarks: OverthinkingBench,
featuring simple queries in 72 domains, and UnderthinkingBench, containing 11
challenging reasoning tasks. Using novel thinking-adjusted accuracy metrics, we
perform extensive evaluation of 33 different thinking and non-thinking models
and show that no model is able to optimally think on our benchmark. Thinking
models often overthink for hundreds of tokens on the simplest user queries
without improving performance. In contrast, large non-thinking models
underthink, often falling short of much smaller thinking models. We further
explore several methods to encourage optimal thinking, but find that these
approaches often improve on one sub-benchmark at the expense of the other,
highlighting the need for better unified and optimal models in the future.

Conclusion: 建议评估设计者追求高信号低噪声，通过指标优化和任务筛选提升评估质量，促进更可靠的模型开发决策。

Abstract: Developing large language models is expensive and involves making decisions
with small experiments, typically by evaluating on large, multi-task evaluation
suites. In this work, we analyze specific properties which make a benchmark
more reliable for such decisions, and interventions to design higher-quality
evaluation benchmarks. We introduce two key metrics that show differences in
current benchmarks: signal, a benchmark's ability to separate better models
from worse models, and noise, a benchmark's sensitivity to random variability
between training steps. We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better
signal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale,
and those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error. These
results suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful
benchmarks, so we introduce three interventions designed to directly affect
signal or noise. For example, we propose that switching to a metric that has
better signal and noise (e.g., perplexity rather than accuracy) leads to better
reliability and improved scaling law error. We also find that filtering noisy
subtasks, to improve an aggregate signal-to-noise ratio, leads to more reliable
multi-task evaluations. We also find that averaging the output of a model's
intermediate checkpoints to reduce noise leads to consistent improvements. We
conclude by recommending that those creating new benchmarks, or selecting which
existing benchmarks to use, aim for high signal and low noise. We use 30
benchmarks for these experiments, and 375 open-weight language models from 60M
to 32B parameters, resulting in a new, publicly available dataset of 900K
evaluation benchmark results, totaling 200M instances.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成内容的广泛应用，识别其生成文本以防止滥用变得尤为重要，但现有检测方法在需场外（OOD）场景中的表现不足。

Method: 本研究提出RepreGuard，利用代理模型提取文本的表示，分辨由LLMs生成的文本与人类写作的文本，通过投影得分进行分类，结合阈值实现检测。

Result: RepreGuard在ID和OOD场景中平均达到94.92%的AUROC，优于所有基线方法，具备强大的抗攻击能力和对不同文本规模的适应性。

Conclusion: 基于对LLM内部激活特征的统计分析，RepreGuard展示了出色的检测效果和鲁棒性，为内容生成识别提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Detecting content generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
preventing misuse and building trustworthy AI systems. Although existing
detection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD)
scenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to
features used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of
LLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively
capture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between
LLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this
hypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural
activation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we
propose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method.
Specifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of
LGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better
identify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of
the text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a
precomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms
all baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD
scenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and
mainstream attacks. Data and code are publicly available at:

### [82] [Sparse Attention across Multiple-context KV Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11661)
*Ziyi Cao,Qingyi Si,Jingbin Zhang,Bingquan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SamKV，通过注意力稀疏化有效压缩多上下文KV缓存长度，提升多上下文RAG场景下的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长序列推理中多上下文KV缓存效率低下的问题，特别是在检索增强生成（RAG）场景中。

Method: 引入注意力稀疏化技术，根据其他上下文的互补信息进行稀疏化，再局部重计算。

Result: 将序列长度压缩至15%，无需准确性损失，显著提升多上下文RAG场景下的吞吐量。

Conclusion: 提出SamKV，有效应对多上下文KV缓存的存储和计算挑战，提升大语言模型在复杂场景中的推理效率。

Abstract: Large language models face significant cost challenges in long-sequence
inference. To address this, reusing historical Key-Value (KV) Cache for
improved inference efficiency has become a mainstream approach. Recent advances
further enhance throughput by sparse attention mechanisms to select the most
relevant KV Cache, thereby reducing sequence length. However, such techniques
are limited to single-context scenarios, where historical KV Cache is computed
sequentially with causal-attention dependencies. In retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) scenarios, where retrieved documents as context are unknown
beforehand, each document's KV Cache is computed and stored independently
(termed multiple-context KV Cache), lacking cross-attention between contexts.
This renders existing methods ineffective. Although prior work partially
recomputes multiple-context KV Cache to mitigate accuracy loss from missing
cross-attention, it requires retaining all KV Cache throughout, failing to
reduce memory overhead. This paper presents SamKV, the first exploration of
attention sparsification for multiple-context KV Cache. Specifically, SamKV
takes into account the complementary information of other contexts when
sparsifying one context, and then locally recomputes the sparsified
information. Experiments demonstrate that our method compresses sequence length
to 15% without accuracy degradation compared with full-recompuation baselines,
significantly boosting throughput in multi-context RAG scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对对抗文本攻击在Transformer模型中的持续威胁，避免攻击特异性防御和高昂的重训练成本。

Method: 利用重要性启发式排序关键字，测量掩码对嵌入的影响，采用BiLSTM检测模式，结合梯度排名提升识别效果。

Result: 在多数据集、攻击类型和模型中均达到了88%以上的检测准确率，表现优于一些现有方法，且具备良好的泛化性。

Conclusion: RS是一种有效的、无需重训练的对抗文本检测方法，具有实用性和优越的性能。

Abstract: Adversarial text attacks remain a persistent threat to transformer models,
yet existing defenses are typically attack-specific or require costly model
retraining. We introduce Representation Stability (RS), a model-agnostic
detection framework that identifies adversarial examples by measuring how
embedding representations change when important words are masked. RS first
ranks words using importance heuristics, then measures embedding sensitivity to
masking top-k critical words, and processes the resulting patterns with a
BiLSTM detector. Experiments show that adversarially perturbed words exhibit
disproportionately high masking sensitivity compared to naturally important
words. Across three datasets, three attack types, and two victim models, RS
achieves over 88% detection accuracy and demonstrates competitive performance
compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, often at lower computational
cost. Using Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) to measure
perturbation identification quality, we reveal that gradient-based ranking
outperforms attention and random selection approaches, with identification
quality correlating with detection performance for word-level attacks. RS also
generalizes well to unseen datasets, attacks, and models without retraining,
providing a practical solution for adversarial text detection.

Motivation: 解决非侵入性血压监测在嵌入式设备上的性能和计算能力不足的问题。

Result: 模型参数少、计算效率高，实时监测表现优异，但存在不同人群条件下性能差异大的挑战。

Conclusion: 为现场无创实时血压监测奠定基础，未来需提升模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Noninvasive arterial blood pressure (ABP) monitoring is essential for patient
management in critical care and perioperative settings, providing continuous
assessment of cardiovascular hemodynamics with minimal risks. Numerous deep
learning models have developed to reconstruct ABP waveform from noninvasively
acquired physiological signals such as electrocardiogram and
photoplethysmogram. However, limited research has addressed the issue of model
performance and computational load for deployment on embedded systems. The
study introduces a lightweight sInvResUNet, along with a collaborative learning
scheme named KDCL_sInvResUNet. With only 0.89 million parameters and a
computational load of 0.02 GFLOPS, real-time ABP estimation was successfully
achieved on embedded devices with an inference time of just 8.49 milliseconds
for a 10-second output. We performed subject-independent validation in a
large-scale and heterogeneous perioperative dataset containing 1,257,141 data
segments from 2,154 patients, with a wide BP range (41-257 mmHg for SBP, and
31-234 mmHg for DBP). The proposed KDCL_sInvResUNet achieved lightly better
performance compared to large models, with a mean absolute error of 10.06 mmHg
and mean Pearson correlation of 0.88 in tracking ABP changes. Despite these
promising results, all deep learning models showed significant performance
variations across different demographic and cardiovascular conditions,
highlighting their limited ability to generalize across such a broad and
diverse population. This study lays a foundation work for real-time,
unobtrusive ABP monitoring in real-world perioperative settings, providing
baseline for future advancements in this area.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决多模态知识整合与保持问题，为生物医学图像领域的增量学习提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Biomedical Image Incremental Learning (MBIIL) is essential for
handling diverse tasks and modalities in the biomedical domain, as training
separate models for each modality or task significantly increases inference
costs. Existing incremental learning methods focus on task expansion within a
single modality, whereas MBIIL seeks to train a unified model incrementally
across modalities. The MBIIL faces two challenges: I) How to preserve
previously learned knowledge during incremental updates? II) How to effectively
leverage knowledge acquired from existing modalities to support new modalities?
To address these challenges, we propose MSLoRA-CR, a method that fine-tunes
Modality-Specific LoRA modules while incorporating Contrastive Regularization
to enhance intra-modality knowledge sharing and promote inter-modality
knowledge differentiation. Our approach builds upon a large vision-language
model (LVLM), keeping the pretrained model frozen while incrementally adapting
new LoRA modules for each modality or task. Experiments on the incremental
learning of biomedical images demonstrate that MSLoRA-CR outperforms both the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach of training separate models for each modality
and the general incremental learning method (incrementally fine-tuning LoRA).
Specifically, MSLoRA-CR achieves a 1.88% improvement in overall performance
compared to unconstrained incremental learning methods while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 该框架提高了神经解法在多场景、不同上下文中的适用性和效果，为VRP解决提供了更通用的解决策略。

Abstract: Deep learning has been extensively explored to solve vehicle routing problems
(VRPs), which yields a range of data-driven neural solvers with promising
outcomes. However, most neural solvers are trained to tackle VRP instances in a
relatively monotonous context, e.g., simplifying VRPs by using Euclidean
distance between nodes and adhering to a single problem size, which harms their
off-the-shelf application in different scenarios. To enhance their versatility,
this paper presents a novel lifelong learning framework that incrementally
trains a neural solver to manage VRPs in distinct contexts. Specifically, we
propose a lifelong learner (LL), exploiting a Transformer network as the
backbone, to solve a series of VRPs. The inter-context self-attention mechanism
is proposed within LL to transfer the knowledge obtained from solving preceding
VRPs into the succeeding ones. On top of that, we develop a dynamic context
scheduler (DCS), employing the cross-context experience replay to further
facilitate LL looking back on the attained policies of solving preceding VRPs.
Extensive results on synthetic and benchmark instances (problem sizes up to
18k) show that our LL is capable of discovering effective policies for tackling
generic VRPs in varying contexts, which outperforms other neural solvers and
achieves the best performance for most VRPs.

Abstract: Demographic shifts, influenced by globalization, economic conditions,
geopolitical events, and environmental factors, pose significant challenges for
policymakers and researchers. Accurate demographic forecasting is essential for
informed decision-making in areas such as urban planning, healthcare, and
economic policy. This study explores the application of time series foundation
models to predict demographic changes in the United States using datasets from
the U.S. Census Bureau and Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). We evaluate
the performance of the Time Series Foundation Model (TimesFM) against
traditional baselines including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks,
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Linear Regression. Our
experiments across six demographically diverse states demonstrate that TimesFM
achieves the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) in 86.67% of test cases, with
particularly strong performance on minority populations with sparse historical
data. These findings highlight the potential of pre-trained foundation models
to enhance demographic analysis and inform proactive policy interventions
without requiring extensive task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: The spatial layout of urban sites shapes land-use efficiency and spatial
organization. Traditional site planning often relies on experiential judgment
and single-source data, limiting systematic quantification of multifunctional
layouts. We propose a Site Planning Layout Indicator (SPLI) system, a
data-driven framework integrating empirical knowledge with heterogeneous
multi-source data to produce structured urban spatial information. The SPLI
supports multimodal spatial data systems for analytics, inference, and
retrieval by combining OpenStreetMap (OSM), Points of Interest (POI), building
morphology, land use, and satellite imagery. It extends conventional metrics
through five dimensions: (1) Hierarchical Building Function Classification,
refining empirical systems into clear hierarchies; (2) Spatial Organization,
quantifying seven layout patterns (e.g., symmetrical, concentric,
axial-oriented); (3) Functional Diversity, transforming qualitative assessments
into measurable indicators using Functional Ratio (FR) and Simpson Index (SI);
(4) Accessibility to Essential Services, integrating facility distribution and
transport networks for comprehensive accessibility metrics; and (5) Land Use
Intensity, using Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and Building Coverage Ratio (BCR) to
assess utilization efficiency. Data gaps are addressed through deep learning,
including Relational Graph Neural Networks (RGNN) and Graph Neural Networks
(GNN). Experiments show the SPLI improves functional classification accuracy
and provides a standardized basis for automated, data-driven urban spatial
analytics.

Abstract: Multivariate Hawkes process provides a powerful framework for modeling
temporal dependencies and event-driven interactions in complex systems. While
existing methods primarily focus on uncovering causal structures among observed
subprocesses, real-world systems are often only partially observed, with latent
subprocesses posing significant challenges. In this paper, we show that
continuous-time event sequences can be represented by a discrete-time model as
the time interval shrinks, and we leverage this insight to establish necessary
and sufficient conditions for identifying latent subprocesses and the causal
influences. Accordingly, we propose a two-phase iterative algorithm that
alternates between inferring causal relationships among discovered subprocesses
and uncovering new latent subprocesses, guided by path-based conditions that
guarantee identifiability. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets show that our method effectively recovers causal structures despite
the presence of latent subprocesses.

Abstract: Existing deep learning models for functional MRI-based classification have
limitations in network architecture determination (relying on experience) and
feature space fusion (mostly simple concatenation, lacking mutual learning).
Inspired by the human brain's mechanism of updating neural connections through
learning and decision-making, we proposed a novel BRain-Inspired feature Fusion
(BRIEF) framework, which is able to optimize network architecture automatically
by incorporating an improved neural network connection search (NCS) strategy
and a Transformer-based multi-feature fusion module. Specifically, we first
extracted 4 types of fMRI temporal representations, i.e., time series (TCs),
static/dynamic functional connection (FNC/dFNC), and multi-scale dispersion
entropy (MsDE), to construct four encoders. Within each encoder, we employed a
modified Q-learning to dynamically optimize the NCS to extract high-level
feature vectors, where the NCS is formulated as a Markov Decision Process.
Then, all feature vectors were fused via a Transformer, leveraging both
stable/time-varying connections and multi-scale dependencies across different
brain regions to achieve the final classification. Additionally, an attention
module was embedded to improve interpretability. The classification performance
of our proposed BRIEF was compared with 21 state-of-the-art models by
discriminating two mental disorders from healthy controls: schizophrenia (SZ,
n=1100) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n=1550). BRIEF demonstrated
significant improvements of 2.2% to 12.1% compared to 21 algorithms, reaching
an AUC of 91.5% - 0.6% for SZ and 78.4% - 0.5% for ASD, respectively. This is
the first attempt to incorporate a brain-inspired, reinforcement learning
strategy to optimize fMRI-based mental disorder classification, showing
significant potential for identifying precise neuroimaging biomarkers.

Abstract: High-quality labeled geospatial datasets are essential for extracting
insights and understanding our planet. Unfortunately, these datasets often do
not span the entire globe and are limited to certain geographic regions where
data was collected. Google DeepMind's recently released AlphaEarth Foundations
(AEF) provides an information-dense global geospatial representation designed
to serve as a useful input across a wide gamut of tasks. In this article we
propose and evaluate a methodology which leverages AEF to extend geospatial
labeled datasets beyond their initial geographic regions. We show that even
basic models like random forests or logistic regression can be used to
accomplish this task. We investigate a case study of extending LANDFIRE's
Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) dataset beyond the USA into Canada at two levels
of granularity: EvtPhys (13 classes) and EvtGp (80 classes). Qualitatively, for
EvtPhys, model predictions align with ground truth. Trained models achieve 81%
and 73% classification accuracy on EvtPhys validation sets in the USA and
Canada, despite discussed limitations.

Abstract: Real-time fault classification in resource-constrained Internet of Things
(IoT) devices is critical for industrial safety, yet training robust models in
such heterogeneous environments remains a significant challenge. Standard
Federated Learning (FL) often fails in the presence of non-IID data, leading to
model divergence. This paper introduces Fed-Meta-Align, a novel four-phase
framework designed to overcome these limitations through a sophisticated
initialization and training pipeline. Our process begins by training a
foundational model on a general public dataset to establish a competent
starting point. This model then undergoes a serial meta-initialization phase,
where it sequentially trains on a subset of IOT Device data to learn a
heterogeneity-aware initialization that is already situated in a favorable
region of the loss landscape. This informed model is subsequently refined in a
parallel FL phase, which utilizes a dual-criterion aggregation mechanism that
weights for IOT devices updates based on both local performance and cosine
similarity alignment. Finally, an on-device personalization phase adapts the
converged global model into a specialized expert for each IOT Device.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Fed-Meta-Align achieves an average
test accuracy of 91.27% across heterogeneous IOT devices, outperforming
personalized FedAvg and FedProx by up to 3.87% and 3.37% on electrical and
mechanical fault datasets, respectively. This multi-stage approach of sequenced
initialization and adaptive aggregation provides a robust pathway for deploying
high-performance intelligence on diverse TinyML networks.

Result: GRPO在预测中表现出过度自信，去除归一化后校准得以改善，PPO和RLOO表现良好。

Conclusion: 归一化会导致过度自信，需避免，RL在非确定性领域有较大潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven remarkably effective at improving the
accuracy of language models in verifiable and deterministic domains like
mathematics. Here, we examine if current RL methods are also effective at
optimizing language models in verifiable domains with stochastic outcomes, like
scientific experiments. Through applications to synthetic data and real-world
biological experiments, we demonstrate that Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) induces overconfident probability predictions for binary stochastic
outcomes, while Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and REINFORCE Leave-One-Out
(RLOO) yield well-calibrated models. We show that removing group standard
normalization in GRPO fixes its miscalibration and provide a theoretical
explanation for why normalization causes overconfidence. Our results provide
new evidence against the use of standard normalization in GRPO and help pave
the way for applications of RL for reasoning language models beyond
deterministic domains.

Abstract: Generating synthetic data is crucial in privacy-sensitive, data-scarce
settings, especially for tabular datasets widely used in real-world
applications. A key challenge is improving counterfactual and causal fairness,
while preserving high utility. We present FairTabGen, a fairness-aware large
language model-based framework for tabular synthetic data generation. We
integrate multiple fairness definitions including counterfactual and causal
fairness into both its generation and evaluation pipelines. We use in-context
learning, prompt refinement, and fairness-aware data curation to balance
fairness and utility. Across diverse datasets, our method outperforms
state-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods, achieving up to 10%
improvements on fairness metrics such as demographic parity and path-specific
causal effects while retaining statistical utility. Remarkably, it achieves
these gains using less than 20% of the original data, highlighting its
efficiency in low-data regimes. These results demonstrate a principled and
practical approach for generating fair and useful synthetic tabular data.

Conclusion: 利用快捷函数构建的KANs具有高效计算和良好表现的潜力，促进神经网络的发展。

Abstract: For years, many neural networks have been developed based on the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem (KART), which was created to address
Hilbert's 13th problem. Recently, relying on KART, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs) have attracted attention from the research community, stimulating the
use of polynomial functions such as B-splines and RBFs. However, these
functions are not fully supported by GPU devices and are still considered less
popular. In this paper, we propose the use of fast computational functions,
such as ReLU and trigonometric functions (e.g., ReLU, sin, cos, arctan), as
basis components in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). By integrating these
function combinations into the network structure, we aim to enhance
computational efficiency. Experimental results show that these combinations
maintain competitive performance while offering potential improvements in
training time and generalization.

Conclusion: 本文提出的PCA-Grad-CAM与SVM-Grad-CAM有效拓展了Grad-CAM的应用范围，有助于理解加入PCA和SVM的CNN模型，推动白盒化研究。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an effective approach for
classification tasks, particularly when the training dataset is large. Although
CNNs have long been considered a black-box classification method, they can be
used as a white-box method through visualization techniques such as Grad-CAM.
When training samples are limited, incorporating a Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) layer and/or a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier into a CNN can
effectively improve classification performance. However, traditional Grad-CAM
cannot be directly applied to PCA and/or SVM layers. It is important to
generate attention regions for PCA and/or SVM layers in CNNs to facilitate the
development of white-box methods. Therefore, we propose ``PCA-Grad-CAM'', a
method for visualizing attention regions in PCA feature vectors, and
``SVM-Grad-CAM'', a method for visualizing attention regions in an SVM
classifier layer. To complete our methods analytically, it is necessary to
solve the closed-form Jacobian consisting of partial derivatives from the last
convolutional layer to the PCA and/or SVM layers. In this paper, we present the
exact closed-form Jacobian and the visualization results of our methods applied
to several major datasets.

Result: 验证ENA模型在长序列高阶数据建模中表现优越，兼具效率与效果。

Conclusion: 线性递归与高阶SWA结合提供一种简洁而有效的高阶数据建模框架，适用于超长序列数据。

Abstract: Efficient modeling of long sequences of high-order data requires a more
efficient architecture than Transformer. In this paper, we investigate two key
aspects of extending linear recurrent models, especially those originally
designed for language modeling, to high-order data (1D to ND): scanning
strategies and attention-hybrid architectures. Empirical results suggest that
scanning provides limited benefits, while attention-hybrid models yield
promising results. Focusing on the latter, we further evaluate types of
attention and find that tiled high-order sliding window attention (SWA) is
efficient in both theory and practice. We term the resulting hybrid
architecture of linear recurrence and high-order SWA as Efficient N-dimensional
Attention (ENA). We then conduct several experiments to demonstrate its
effectiveness. The intuition behind ENA is that linear recurrence compresses
global information into a state, while SWA complements it by enforcing strict
local modeling. Together, they form a simple framework that offers a promising
and practical solution for ultra-long high-order data modeling.

Conclusion: 尺度解耦模型能有效提升长预测精度，缓解误差累积，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Long-term traffic emission forecasting is crucial for the comprehensive
management of urban air pollution. Traditional forecasting methods typically
construct spatiotemporal graph models by mining spatiotemporal dependencies to
predict emissions. However, due to the multi-scale entanglement of traffic
emissions across time and space, these spatiotemporal graph modeling method
tend to suffer from cascading error amplification during long-term inference.
To address this issue, we propose a Scale-Disentangled Spatio-Temporal Modeling
(SDSTM) framework for long-term traffic emission forecasting. It leverages the
predictability differences across multiple scales to decompose and fuse
features at different scales, while constraining them to remain independent yet
complementary. Specifically, the model first introduces a dual-stream feature
decomposition strategy based on the Koopman lifting operator. It lifts the
scale-coupled spatiotemporal dynamical system into an infinite-dimensional
linear space via Koopman operator, and delineates the predictability boundary
using gated wavelet decomposition. Then a novel fusion mechanism is
constructed, incorporating a dual-stream independence constraint based on
cross-term loss to dynamically refine the dual-stream prediction results,
suppress mutual interference, and enhance the accuracy of long-term traffic
emission prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on a road-level traffic
emission dataset within Xi'an's Second Ring Road demonstrate that the proposed
model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 该算法有效解决了对抗性损失和随机动作集条件下的线性bandit问题，特别在组合bandit中实现了低遗憾和多项式时间，为相关研究提供新思路。

Abstract: We present an efficient algorithm for linear contextual bandits with
adversarial losses and stochastic action sets. Our approach reduces this
setting to misspecification-robust adversarial linear bandits with fixed action
sets. Without knowledge of the context distribution or access to a context
simulator, the algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(\min\{d^2\sqrt{T}, \sqrt{d^3T\log
K}\})$ regret and runs in $\text{poly}(d,C,T)$ time, where $d$ is the feature
dimension, $C$ is an upper bound on the number of linear constraints defining
the action set in each round, $K$ is an upper bound on the number of actions in
each round, and $T$ is number of rounds. This resolves the open question by Liu
et al. (2023) on whether one can obtain $\text{poly}(d)\sqrt{T}$ regret in
polynomial time independent of the number of actions. For the important class
of combinatorial bandits with adversarial losses and stochastic action sets
where the action sets can be described by a polynomial number of linear
constraints, our algorithm is the first to achieve $\text{poly}(d)\sqrt{T}$
regret in polynomial time, while no prior algorithm achieves even $o(T)$ regret
in polynomial time to our knowledge. When a simulator is available, the regret
bound can be improved to $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{L^\star})$, where $L^\star$ is the
cumulative loss of the best policy.

Motivation: 现有的多模态OOD检测方法难以在不同分布变化场景中找到统一最优模型，缺乏自动选择机制。

Result: 在12个测试场景中，M3OOD明显优于10个对比基线，具有低计算成本。

Conclusion: M3OOD通过元学习实现多模态OOD检测器的高效自动选择，提升系统鲁棒性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness is a critical challenge for modern
machine learning systems, particularly as they increasingly operate in
multimodal settings involving inputs like video, audio, and sensor data.
Currently, many OOD detection methods have been proposed, each with different
designs targeting various distribution shifts. A single OOD detector may not
prevail across all the scenarios; therefore, how can we automatically select an
ideal OOD detection model for different distribution shifts? Due to the
inherent unsupervised nature of the OOD detection task, it is difficult to
predict model performance and find a universally Best model. Also,
systematically comparing models on the new unseen data is costly or even
impractical. To address this challenge, we introduce M3OOD, a
meta-learning-based framework for OOD detector selection in multimodal
settings. Meta learning offers a solution by learning from historical model
behaviors, enabling rapid adaptation to new data distribution shifts with
minimal supervision. Our approach combines multimodal embeddings with
handcrafted meta-features that capture distributional and cross-modal
characteristics to represent datasets. By leveraging historical performance
across diverse multimodal benchmarks, M3OOD can recommend suitable detectors
for a new data distribution shift. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that
M3OOD consistently outperforms 10 competitive baselines across 12 test
scenarios with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Analog Compute-In-Memory (CIM) architectures promise significant energy
efficiency gains for neural network inference, but suffer from complex
hardware-induced noise that poses major challenges for deployment. While
noise-aware training methods have been proposed to address this issue, they
typically rely on idealized and differentiable noise models that fail to
capture the full complexity of analog CIM hardware variations. Motivated by the
Straight-Through Estimator (STE) framework in quantization, we decouple forward
noise simulation from backward gradient computation, enabling noise-aware
training with more accurate but computationally intractable noise modeling in
analog CIM systems. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our
approach preserves essential gradient directional information while maintaining
computational tractability and optimization stability. Extensive experiments
show that our extended STE framework achieves up to 5.3% accuracy improvement
on image classification, 0.72 perplexity reduction on text generation,
2.2$\times$ speedup in training time, and 37.9% lower peak memory usage
compared to standard noise-aware training methods.

Conclusion: 集成反事实与事实解释的方法有助于提高MTPP模型的可信度与可解释性。

Abstract: Neural network-based Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) models have been
widely adopted to model event sequences in high-stakes applications, raising
concerns about the trustworthiness of outputs from these models. This study
focuses on Explanation for MTPP, aiming to identify the minimal and rational
explanation, that is, the minimum subset of events in history, based on which
the prediction accuracy of MTPP matches that based on full history to a great
extent and better than that based on the complement of the subset. This study
finds that directly defining Explanation for MTPP as counterfactual explanation
or factual explanation can result in irrational explanations. To address this
issue, we define Explanation for MTPP as a combination of counterfactual
explanation and factual explanation. This study proposes Counterfactual and
Factual Explainer for MTPP (CFF) to solve Explanation for MTPP with a series of
deliberately designed techniques. Experiments demonstrate the correctness and
superiority of CFF over baselines regarding explanation quality and processing
efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合Transformer和集合识别技术，有效应对类别不平衡和非线性问题，显著提升高排放车辆的检测准确率，对城市污染防控具有重要意义。

Abstract: Identifying high-emission vehicles is a crucial step in regulating urban
pollution levels and formulating traffic emission reduction strategies.
However, in practical monitoring data, the proportion of high-emission state
data is significantly lower compared to normal emission states. This
characteristic long-tailed distribution severely impedes the extraction of
discriminative features for emission state identification during data mining.
Furthermore, the highly nonlinear nature of vehicle emission states and the
lack of relevant prior knowledge also pose significant challenges to the
construction of identification models.To address the aforementioned issues, we
propose a Set-Valued Transformer Network (SVTN) to achieve comprehensive
learning of discriminative features from high-emission samples, thereby
enhancing detection accuracy. Specifically, this model first employs the
transformer to measure the temporal similarity of micro-trip condition
variations, thus constructing a mapping rule that projects the original
high-dimensional emission data into a low-dimensional feature space. Next, a
set-valued identification algorithm is used to probabilistically model the
relationship between the generated feature vectors and their labels, providing
an accurate metric criterion for the classification algorithm. To validate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted extensive experiments on
the diesel vehicle monitoring data of Hefei city in 2020. The results
demonstrate that our method achieves a 9.5\% reduction in the missed detection
rate for high-emission vehicles compared to the transformer-based baseline,
highlighting its superior capability in accurately identifying high-emission
mobile pollution sources.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索参数高效微调中LoRA模块的相互作用，寻找无需重新训练即能组合多个任务适配器的方法。

Method: 在GPT-2小模型上训练不同领域的LoRA模块，利用余弦相似度分析参数的正交性，并测试不同组合的影响。

Result: 简单相加不同领域的LoRA模块能改善模型性能，且与参数正交性呈正相关，表现优于简单的合并训练。

Conclusion: LoRA参数具有良好的线性叠加性质，提供了一种快速、有效的多任务适配策略，揭示了高阶组合时的干扰现象。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models are driven by scale, while
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) enables updating only a small fraction
of parameters. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) stores parameter deltas as the
product of two small matrices, which makes them natural building blocks that
can be composed. Motivated by the superposition principle, we hypothesize that
independently trained LoRA modules on disjoint domains are approximately
orthogonal and can be combined by simple addition. Using GPT-2 Small (117M)
with LoRA rank 4 and alpha=64, we train adapters for three QA domains (math,
medicine, finance). In pairwise tests, adding Math+Medicine adapters improves
perplexity by -9.10% relative to merged-data fine-tuning, while Math+Finance
and Finance+Medicine change by +4.54% and +27.56%, respectively. Across
combinations, the RMS cosine similarity between LoRA deltas correlates
positively and approximately linearly with the change in perplexity. Naive
summation requires no additional training, can be applied in seconds, and
achieves performance comparable to models trained on merged data, while
clarifying when interference appears in higher-order compositions.

Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of learning a marginally stable unknown
nonlinear dynamical system. We describe an algorithm for this problem, based on
the technique of spectral filtering, which learns a mapping from past
observations to the next based on a spectral representation of the system.
Using techniques from online convex optimization, we prove vanishing prediction
error for any nonlinear dynamical system that has finitely many marginally
stable modes, with rates governed by a novel quantitative control-theoretic
notion of learnability. The main technical component of our method is a new
spectral filtering algorithm for linear dynamical systems, which incorporates
past observations and applies to general noisy and marginally stable systems.
This significantly generalizes the original spectral filtering algorithm to
both asymmetric dynamics as well as incorporating noise correction, and is of
independent interest.

Conclusion: 基于HDC的FedUHD在隐私保护、效率及鲁棒性方面表现优越，为UFL应用提供新方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised federated learning (UFL) has gained attention as a
privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning approach that eliminates the
need for labor-intensive data labeling. However, UFL faces several challenges
in practical applications: (1) non-independent and identically distributed
(non-iid) data distribution across devices, (2) expensive computational and
communication costs at the edge, and (3) vulnerability to communication noise.
Previous UFL approaches have relied on deep neural networks (NN), which
introduce substantial overhead in both computation and communication. In this
paper, we propose FedUHD, the first UFL framework based on Hyperdimensional
Computing (HDC). HDC is a brain-inspired computing scheme with lightweight
training and inference operations, much smaller model size, and robustness to
communication noise. FedUHD introduces two novel HDC-based designs to improve
UFL performance. On the client side, a kNN-based cluster hypervector removal
method addresses non-iid data samples by eliminating detrimental outliers. On
the server side, a weighted HDC aggregation technique balances the non-iid data
distribution across clients. Our experiments demonstrate that FedUHD achieves
up to 173.6x and 612.7x better speedup and energy efficiency, respectively, in
training, up to 271x lower communication cost, and 15.50% higher accuracy on
average across diverse settings, along with superior robustness to various
types of noise compared to state-of-the-art NN-based UFL approaches.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a vital paradigm in modern machine
learning that enables collaborative training across decentralized data sources
without exchanging raw data. This approach not only addresses privacy concerns
but also allows access to overall substantially larger and potentially more
diverse datasets, without the need for centralized storage or hardware
resources. However, heterogeneity in client data may cause certain clients to
have disproportionate impacts on the global model, leading to disparities in
the clients' performances. Fairness, therefore, becomes a crucial concern in FL
and can be addressed in various ways. However, the effectiveness of existing
fairness-aware methods, particularly in heterogeneous data settings, remains
unclear, and the relationships between different approaches are not well
understood. In this work, we focus on performance equitable fairness, which
aims to minimize differences in performance across clients. We restrict our
study to fairness-aware methods that explicitly regularize client losses,
evaluating both existing and newly proposed approaches. We identify and
theoretically explain connections between the investigated fairness methods,
and empirically show that FairGrad (approximate) and FairGrad* (exact) (two
variants of a gradient variance regularization method introduced here for
performance equitable fairness) improve both fairness and overall model
performance in heterogeneous data settings.

Conclusion: VARAN有效推进了自监督语音表示的高效适应，为多任务语音模型提供了更灵活的层级聚合策略。

Abstract: Conventional methods for aggregating layers in fine-tuned self-supervised
speech models, such as using the final layer or weighted sum, suffer from
information bottlenecks and static feature weighting for all dataset examples.
We propose VARAN, a framework that dynamically tailors layer aggregation to
individual inputs. By employing layer-specialized probing heads and
data-dependent weighting, VARAN adaptively prioritizes layer's features based
on input. Evaluations on automatic speech recognition and speech emotion
recognition tasks demonstrate VARAN's superior performance, particularly when
using the LoRA fine-tuning technique. The framework resolves the trade-off
between preserving layer-specific information and enabling flexible feature
utilization, advancing efficient adaptation of self-supervised speech
representations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LP引导的深度强化学习算法，用于优化ISAC基础上的AIGC网络中的资源分配，显著提升内容质量和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ISAC应在AIGC网络中的应用，如何在 sensing、生成和通信三方面平衡资源以提升整体体验成为关键问题。

Method: 结合线性规划指导的深度强化学习，设计了LPDRL-F算法，优化资源配置并降低复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，LPDRL-F在资源优化速度和效果上优于现有方法，提升了内容准确性和体验质量。

Conclusion: LPDRL-F有效实现了多维资源优化，推动ISAC-AIGC网络的发展，改善用户体验。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can enhance artificial
intelligence-generated content (AIGC) networks by providing efficient sensing
and transmission. Existing AIGC services usually assume that the accuracy of
the generated content can be ensured, given accurate input data and prompt,
thus only the content generation quality (CGQ) is concerned. However, it is not
applicable in ISAC-based AIGC networks, where content generation is based on
inaccurate sensed data. Moreover, the AIGC model itself introduces generation
errors, which depend on the number of generating steps (i.e., computing
resources). To assess the quality of experience of ISAC-based AIGC services, we
propose a content accuracy and quality aware service assessment metric (CAQA).
Since allocating more resources to sensing and generating improves content
accuracy but may reduce communication quality, and vice versa, this
sensing-generating (computing)-communication three-dimensional resource
tradeoff must be optimized to maximize the average CAQA (AvgCAQA) across all
users with AIGC (CAQA-AIGC). This problem is NP-hard, with a large solution
space that grows exponentially with users. To solve the CAQA-AIGC problem with
low complexity, a linear programming (LP) guided deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) algorithm with an action filter (LPDRL-F) is proposed. Through the
LP-guided approach and the action filter, LPDRL-F can transform the original
three-dimensional solution space to two dimensions, reducing complexity while
improving the learning performance of DRL. Simulations show that compared to
existing DRL and generative diffusion model algorithms without LP, LPDRL-F
converges faster by over 60% and finds better resource allocation solutions,
improving AvgCAQA by more than 14%. With LPDRL-F, CAQA-AIGC can achieve an
improvement in AvgCAQA of more than 50% compared to existing schemes focusing
solely on CGQ.

Motivation: 需要从大规模患者长期健康记录中提取洞察，促进个性化医疗的发展。

Method: 训练了在1亿多患者数据基础上的生成式Transformer模型，进行预训练并进行模型规模扩展，验证其在多项临床任务中的有效性。

Result: CoMET在78个临床任务中优于或匹配专门任务模型，随着模型规模和预训练数据的增加，性能不断提升。

Conclusion: 生成式医疗事件基础模型能有效捕捉临床动态，具备广泛应用潜力，支持临床决策和改善患者结局。

Abstract: Realizing personalized medicine at scale calls for methods that distill
insights from longitudinal patient journeys, which can be viewed as a sequence
of medical events. Foundation models pretrained on large-scale medical event
data represent a promising direction for scaling real-world evidence generation
and generalizing to diverse downstream tasks. Using Epic Cosmos, a dataset with
medical events from de-identified longitudinal health records for 16.3 billion
encounters over 300 million unique patient records from 310 health systems, we
introduce the Cosmos Medical Event Transformer ( CoMET) models, a family of
decoder-only transformer models pretrained on 118 million patients representing
115 billion discrete medical events (151 billion tokens). We present the
largest scaling-law study for medical event data, establishing a methodology
for pretraining and revealing power-law scaling relationships for compute,
tokens, and model size. Based on this, we pretrained a series of
compute-optimal models with up to 1 billion parameters. Conditioned on a
patient's real-world history, CoMET autoregressively generates the next medical
event, simulating patient health timelines. We studied 78 real-world tasks,
including diagnosis prediction, disease prognosis, and healthcare operations.
Remarkably for a foundation model with generic pretraining and simulation-based
inference, CoMET generally outperformed or matched task-specific supervised
models on these tasks, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning or few-shot
examples. CoMET's predictive power consistently improves as the model and
pretraining scale. Our results show that CoMET, a generative medical event
foundation model, can effectively capture complex clinical dynamics, providing
an extensible and generalizable framework to support clinical decision-making,
streamline healthcare operations, and improve patient outcomes.

Conclusion: 该方法有效改善数据集混合策略，为模型调优提供了更智能的动态调节工具。

Abstract: As numerous instruction-tuning datasets continue to emerge during the
post-training stage, dynamically balancing and optimizing their mixtures has
become a critical challenge. To address this, we propose DynamixSFT, a dynamic
and automated method for instruction-tuning dataset mixture optimization. We
formulate the problem as a multi-armed bandit setup and introduce a
Prior-scaled Boltzmann Exploration that softly anchors the updated sampling
distribution to the original dataset proportions, thereby preserving the
inherent diversity and coverage of the collection. Sampling probabilities are
updated using a lightweight 1-Step Look-ahead Reward, reflecting how much the
dataset contributes to improving the model's performance at its current state.
When applied to the Tulu-v2-mixture collection comprising 16 instruction-tuning
datasets, DynamixSFT achieves up to a 2.2% performance improvement across 10
benchmarks. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis and visualizations
to offer deeper insights into the adaptive dynamics of our method.

Conclusion: 门控机制本质上是动力学系统中的一种调节器，阐明其在提升RNN训练效果中的作用机理。

Abstract: We study how gating mechanisms in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) implicitly
induce adaptive learning-rate behavior, even when training is carried out with
a fixed, global learning rate. This effect arises from the coupling between
state-space time scales--parametrized by the gates--and parameter-space
dynamics during gradient descent. By deriving exact Jacobians for
leaky-integrator and gated RNNs, we obtain a first-order expansion that makes
explicit how constant, scalar, and multi-dimensional gates reshape gradient
propagation, modulate effective step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in
parameter updates. These findings reveal that gates not only control memory
retention in the hidden states, but also act as data-driven preconditioners
that adapt optimization trajectories in parameter space. We further draw formal
analogies with learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods such as
Adam, showing that these optimization behaviors emerge naturally from gating.
Numerical experiments confirm the validity of our perturbative analysis,
supporting the view that gate-induced corrections remain small while exerting
systematic effects on training dynamics. Overall, this work provides a unified
dynamical-systems perspective on how gating couples state evolution with
parameter updates, explaining why gated architectures achieve robust
trainability and stability in practice.

Conclusion: DE-VAE有效提升了自编码器的投影与逆向映射性能，同时具备不确定性分析，有助于拓展其应用范围。

Abstract: Recently, autoencoders (AEs) have gained interest for creating parametric and
invertible projections of multidimensional data. Parametric projections make it
possible to embed new, unseen samples without recalculating the entire
projection, while invertible projections allow the synthesis of new data
instances. However, existing methods perform poorly when dealing with
out-of-distribution samples in either the data or embedding space. Thus, we
propose DE-VAE, an uncertainty-aware variational AE using differential entropy
(DE) to improve the learned parametric and invertible projections. Given a
fixed projection, we train DE-VAE to learn a mapping into 2D space and an
inverse mapping back to the original space. We conduct quantitative and
qualitative evaluations on four well-known datasets, using UMAP and t-SNE as
baseline projection methods. Our findings show that DE-VAE can create
parametric and inverse projections with comparable accuracy to other current
AE-based approaches while enabling the analysis of embedding uncertainty.

Abstract: The paradigm of electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has evolved into real-time
digital analysis, facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
learning (ML), which has improved the diagnostic precision and predictive
capacity of cardiac diseases. This work proposes a novel deep learning (DL)
architecture called the attention-integrated convolutional residual network
(AICRN) to regress key ECG parameters such as the PR interval, the QT interval,
the QRS duration, the heart rate, the peak amplitude of the R wave, and the
amplitude of the T wave for interpretable ECG analysis. Our architecture is
specially designed with spatial and channel attention-related mechanisms to
address the type and spatial location of the ECG features for regression. The
models employ a convolutional residual network to address vanishing and
exploding gradient problems. The designed system addresses traditional analysis
challenges, such as loss of focus due to human errors, and facilitates the fast
and easy detection of cardiac events, thereby reducing the manual efforts
required to solve analysis tasks. AICRN models outperform existing models in
parameter regression with higher precision. This work demonstrates that DL can
play a crucial role in the interpretability and precision of ECG analysis,
opening up new clinical applications for cardiac monitoring and management.

Motivation: 解决现有蛋白质大模型在输入长度过长和在少样本学习中的限制，提升模型的效率和泛化能力。

Method: 设计联合嵌入压缩机制融合序列和结构信息，降低输入长度；开发自我压缩模块将演示压缩至极少的提示长度，结合提示微调策略。

Conclusion: ProtTeX-CC显著改善了蛋白质大模型的输入效率和泛化能力，为少样本蛋白质预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in protein large language models, such as ProtTeX, represent
both side-chain amino acids and backbone structure as discrete token sequences
of residue length. While this design enables unified modeling of multimodal
protein information, it suffers from two major limitations: (1) The
concatenation of sequence and structure tokens approximately doubles the
protein length and breaks the intrinsic residue-level alignment between
modalities. (2) Constrained by the training corpus and limited context window,
ProtTeX is typically trained on single-protein inputs, rendering it
incompatible with in-context learning (ICL) and thus limiting its
generalization capability. To address these issues, we propose ProtTeX-CC, a
lightweight two-stage compression framework designed to enhance ProtTeX under
few-shot settings. We first design a joint embedding compression mechanism that
fuses sequence and structure representations at the residue level, effectively
reducing the protein input length by half without sacrificing performance. Then
we propose a self-compression module that aggregates each full demonstration
into the latent space of the last few linguistic tokens, reducing the average
demonstration length from 751 tokens to less than 16 tokens. Compared to the
original ProtTeX, our self-compression approach achieves a compression ratio of
approximately 93.68% in the total prompt length under the 16-shot setting.
Without modifying the backbone model, ProtTeX-CC introduces only a small number
of additional parameters through PEFT-based tuning in the joint embedding
compression stage and a single trainable projection layer in the
self-compression stage. Extensive experiments on protein function prediction
show that ProtTeX-CC improves performance on the in-domain benchmark by 2%, and
generalizes well to the out-of-domain dataset with a performance gain of 11%.

Motivation: 随着大规模语言模型的应用普及，保护用户隐私、满足“被遗忘权”成为重要需求，然而如何有效、精确地将模型中已删除的数据“抹去”成为挑战。

Conclusion: 基于系统设计的可复制“被遗忘”方案，使大模型的隐私保护更为可靠，为未来实用化提供可能。

Abstract: We study the right to be forgotten (GDPR Art. 17) for large language models
and frame unlearning as a reproducible systems problem. Our approach treats
training as a deterministic program and logs a minimal per-microbatch record
(ordered ID hash, RNG seed, learning-rate value, optimizer-step counter, and
accumulation boundary). Under a pinned stack and deterministic kernels,
replaying the training tail while filtering only the forget closure yields the
same parameters as training on the retain set (bit-identical in the training
dtype) when preconditions hold. To meet latency and availability constraints,
we add complementary paths: (i) exact reverts of recent steps via
micro-checkpoints or dense per-step deltas, (ii) cohort-scoped adapter deletion
when the base is frozen, and (iii) a curvature-guided anti-update followed by a
short retain-tune, audit-gated with escalation to exact replay. We report
storage/latency budgets and a toy artifact validating mechanics; in a
controlled run that satisfies the preconditions we demonstrate byte-identical
equality of model and optimizer states.

Abstract: Recent advancement in generative models have demonstrated remarkable
performance across various data modalities. Beyond their typical use in data
synthesis, these models play a crucial role in distribution matching tasks such
as latent variable modeling, domain translation, and domain adaptation.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as the preferred method of
distribution matching due to their efficacy in handling high-dimensional data
and their flexibility in accommodating various constraints. However, GANs often
encounter challenge in training due to their bi-level min-max optimization
objective and susceptibility to mode collapse. In this work, we propose a novel
approach for distribution matching inspired by the consistency models employed
in Continuous Normalizing Flow (CNF). Our model inherits the advantages of CNF
models, such as having a straight forward norm minimization objective, while
remaining adaptable to different constraints similar to GANs. We provide
theoretical validation of our proposed objective and demonstrate its
performance through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: In distributed optimization and federated learning, asynchronous alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) serves as an attractive option for
large-scale optimization, data privacy, straggler nodes and variety of
objective functions. However, communication costs can become a major bottleneck
when the nodes have limited communication budgets or when the data to be

coarse quantization to the data to be exchanged in aynchronous ADMM so as to
reduce communication overhead for large-scale federated learning and
distributed optimization applications. We experimentally verify the convergence
of the proposed method for several distributed learning tasks, including neural

Abstract: With the success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in various application
fields beyond natural language processing, language models have raised emerging
attention in the field of time series forecasting (TSF) and have shown great
prospects. However, current PLM-based TSF methods still fail to achieve
satisfactory prediction accuracy matching the strong sequential modeling power
of language models. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Model and
Cross-Modality Learning with PLMs for time series forecasting (CC-Time). We
explore the potential of PLMs for time series forecasting from two aspects: 1)
what time series features could be modeled by PLMs, and 2) whether relying
solely on PLMs is sufficient for building time series models. In the first
aspect, CC-Time incorporates cross-modality learning to model temporal
dependency and channel correlations in the language model from both time series
sequences and their corresponding text descriptions. In the second aspect,
CC-Time further proposes the cross-model fusion block to adaptively integrate
knowledge from the PLMs and time series model to form a more comprehensive
modeling of time series patterns. Extensive experiments on nine real-world
datasets demonstrate that CC-Time achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy
in both full-data training and few-shot learning situations.

Abstract: Although conventional deep graph models have achieved great success in
relational learning, their focus on pairwise relationships limits their
capacity to learn pervasive higher-order interactions in real-world complex
systems, which can be naturally modeled as hypergraphs. To tackle this,
hypergraph neural networks (HNNs), the dominant approach in deep hypergraph
learning (DHGL), has garnered substantial attention in recent years. Despite
the proposal of numerous HNN methods, there is no comprehensive benchmark for
HNNs, which creates a great obstacle to understanding the progress of DHGL in
several aspects: (i) insufficient coverage of datasets, algorithms, and tasks;
(ii) a narrow evaluation of algorithm performance; and (iii) inconsistent
dataset usage, preprocessing, and experimental setups that hinder
comparability. To fill the gap, we introduce DHG-Bench, the first comprehensive
benchmark for DHGL. Specifically, DHG-Bench integrates 20 diverse datasets
spanning node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks, along with 16 state-of-the-art
HNN algorithms, under consistent data processing and experimental protocols.
Our benchmark systematically investigates the characteristics of HNNs in terms
of four dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and fairness.
Further, to facilitate reproducible research, we have developed an easy-to-use
library for training and evaluating different HNN methods. Extensive
experiments conducted with DHG-Bench reveal both the strengths and inherent
limitations of existing algorithms, offering valuable insights and directions
for future research. The code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Recently, spatio-temporal time-series prediction has developed rapidly, yet
existing deep learning methods struggle with learning complex long-term
spatio-temporal dependencies efficiently. The long-term spatio-temporal
dependency learning brings two new challenges: 1) The long-term temporal
sequence includes multiscale information naturally which is hard to extract
efficiently; 2) The multiscale temporal information from different nodes is
highly correlated and hard to model. To address these challenges, we propose an
efficient \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ultiscale
\textbf{M}amba} (STM2) that includes a multiscale Mamba architecture to capture
the multiscale information efficiently and simultaneously, and an adaptive
graph causal convolution network to learn the complex multiscale
spatio-temporal dependency. STM2 includes hierarchical information aggregation
for different-scale information that guarantees their distinguishability. To
capture diverse temporal dynamics across all spatial nodes more efficiently, we
further propose an enhanced version termed
\textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ixture of
\textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM3) that employs a special
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, including a more stable routing strategy and a
causal contrastive learning strategy to enhance the scale distinguishability.
We prove that STM3 has much better routing smoothness and guarantees the
pattern disentanglement for each expert successfully. Extensive experiments on
real-world benchmarks demonstrate STM2/STM3's superior performance, achieving
state-of-the-art results in long-term spatio-temporal time-series prediction.

### [122] [Interpreting Time Series Forecasts with LIME and SHAP: A Case Study on the Air Passengers Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12253)
*Manish Shukla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出一种结合LIME和SHAP的时间序列预测解释框架，利用滞后特征和季节性编码实现模型可解释性，兼顾准确性与透明性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要在时间序列预测中同时实现模型的高准确率和解释性，解决传统模型与机器学习模型的局限性。

Method: 将单变量时间序列转化为监督学习问题，训练梯度提升树和ARIMA模型，采用LIME和SHAP进行后期可解释性分析。

Result: 通过航空旅客数据验证，发现少量滞后特征（尤其是12个月滞后）和季节性编码能解释大部分预测方差，提供了实用的解释方法。

Conclusion: 提出了适用于时间序列的LIME和SHAP应用方法，为实践者提供了理论基础和操作指南，有助于实现模型的透明性和高性能。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting underpins critical decisions across aviation, energy,
retail and health. Classical autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
models offer interpretability via coefficients but struggle with
nonlinearities, whereas tree-based machine-learning models such as XGBoost
deliver high accuracy but are often opaque. This paper presents a unified
framework for interpreting time-series forecasts using local interpretable
model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP). We
convert a univariate series into a leakage-free supervised learning problem,
train a gradient-boosted tree alongside an ARIMA baseline and apply post-hoc
explainability. Using the Air Passengers dataset as a case study, we show that
a small set of lagged features -- particularly the twelve-month lag -- and
seasonal encodings explain most forecast variance. We contribute: (i) a
methodology for applying LIME and SHAP to time series without violating
chronology; (ii) theoretical exposition of the underlying algorithms; (iii)
empirical evaluation with extensive analysis; and (iv) guidelines for
practitioners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补深度学习在数据需求大、泛化差及计算成本高等方面的限制，探索更高效的优化方法。

Method: 引入可训练预条件单元，增强古典对称秩一（SR1）算法，通过学习映射生成数据驱动的向量以构建正半定秩一矩阵。

Result: 在分析实验和单目人体网格重建任务中均优于现有学习优化方法，模型轻量、无需标注或微调。

Conclusion: 该方法具有良好的泛化能力，可方便集成到更广泛的优化框架中，推动优化算法的创新与应用。

Abstract: End-to-end deep learning has achieved impressive results but remains limited
by its reliance on large labeled datasets, poor generalization to unseen
scenarios, and growing computational demands. In contrast, classical
optimization methods are data-efficient and lightweight but often suffer from
slow convergence. While learned optimizers offer a promising fusion of both
worlds, most focus on first-order methods, leaving learned second-order
approaches largely unexplored.
  We propose a novel learned second-order optimizer that introduces a trainable
preconditioning unit to enhance the classical Symmetric-Rank-One (SR1)
algorithm. This unit generates data-driven vectors used to construct positive
semi-definite rank-one matrices, aligned with the secant constraint via a
learned projection. Our method is evaluated through analytic experiments and on
the real-world task of Monocular Human Mesh Recovery (HMR), where it
outperforms existing learned optimization-based approaches. Featuring a
lightweight model and requiring no annotated data or fine-tuning, our approach
offers strong generalization and is well-suited for integration into broader
optimization-based frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图异常检测中标注稀缺和模型脆弱的问题，提升GNN在复杂场景中的检测能力。

Method: 引入上下文重构对比框架，重组节点属性以生成增强图，分别编码异构关系，结合对比学习提升节点表征，增强模型鲁棒性和区分能力。

Result: 在七个实际数据集上实验，CRoC实现最高14%的AUC提升，优于现有方法，特别在有限标签的条件下效果显著。

Conclusion: CRoC通过结合上下文重构与对比学习，有效增强GNN在图异常检测中的表现，为实际应用提供了强有力的技术支持。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used as the engine for various
graph-related tasks, with their effectiveness in analyzing graph-structured
data. However, training robust GNNs often demands abundant labeled data, which
is a critical bottleneck in real-world applications. This limitation severely
impedes progress in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD), where anomalies are
inherently rare, costly to label, and may actively camouflage their patterns to
evade detection. To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring
Contrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by
jointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from
previous works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor
the context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the
attributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore,
CRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the
message-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex
interaction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while
encouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover
intricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated
with the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness
unlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative
node embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with
varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRoC achieves up to 14%
AUC improvement over baseline GNNs and outperforms state-of-the-art GAD methods
under limited-label settings.

TL;DR: 本文分析了Lion优化器的收敛性质，包括在不同环境下的收敛速率及其改进方法，特别是引入方差降低和通信效率策略，提高了收敛性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究新型优化器Lion的收敛性能及其在分布式环境中的应用，以提升优化效率。

Method: 通过理论分析建立收敛速率，将方差降低技术和通信压缩策略结合，进行增强和优化。

Result: 确定了Lion优化器在不同设定下的收敛速率，提出了改进版本，增强了其实用性和效率。

Conclusion: 该研究系统性分析了Lion优化器的性能，验证了多种改进策略，有助于推动其在大规模深度学习中的应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the convergence properties of the Lion optimizer.
First, we establish that the Lion optimizer attains a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}T^{-1/4})$ under standard assumptions, where $d$ denotes
the problem dimension and $T$ is the iteration number. To further improve this
rate, we introduce the Lion optimizer with variance reduction, resulting in an
enhanced convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}T^{-1/3})$. We then analyze in
distributed settings, where the standard and variance reduced version of the
distributed Lion can obtain the convergence rates of
$\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/4})$ and $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/3})$, with
$n$ denoting the number of nodes. Furthermore, we investigate a
communication-efficient variant of the distributed Lion that ensures sign
compression in both communication directions. By employing the unbiased sign
operations, the proposed Lion variant and its variance reduction counterpart,
achieve convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}\left( \max
\left\{\frac{d^{1/4}}{T^{1/4}}, \frac{d^{1/10}}{n^{1/5}T^{1/5}} \right\}
\right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left( \frac{d^{1/4}}{T^{1/4}} \right)$, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出两种优化扩散模型采样的策略，有效提升样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型中采样效率不足，亟需改善追踪多模态分布的方法。

Method: 引入Funnel Schedule和Adaptive Temperature，调整粒子维护策略。

Result: 在多个基准测试和先进的文本到图像扩散模型中取得优越表现。

Conclusion: 新策略结合探索与利用，有助于提高扩散模型的采样效果和效率。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has achieved remarkable success in language models,
yet its adaptation to diffusion models remains underexplored. We observe that
the efficacy of recent Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)-based methods largely stems
from globally fitting the The reward-tilted distribution, which inherently
preserves diversity during multi-modal search. However, current applications of
SMC to diffusion models face a fundamental dilemma: early-stage noise samples
offer high potential for improvement but are difficult to evaluate accurately,
whereas late-stage samples can be reliably assessed but are largely
irreversible. To address this exploration-exploitation trade-off, we approach
the problem from the perspective of the search algorithm and propose two
strategies: Funnel Schedule and Adaptive Temperature. These simple yet
effective methods are tailored to the unique generation dynamics and
phase-transition behavior of diffusion models. By progressively reducing the
number of maintained particles and down-weighting the influence of early-stage
rewards, our methods significantly enhance sample quality without increasing
the total number of Noise Function Evaluations. Experimental results on
multiple benchmarks and state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models
demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous baselines.

*Rachael DeVries,Casper Christensen,Marie Lisandra Zepeda Mendoza,Ole Winther*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种双轴Transformer模型（BAT）用于更有效地处理和分析电子健康记录（EHR），在败血症预测和死亡率分类中表现优越，具备处理数据稀疏和缺失的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着EHR数据的复杂性增加，现有模型难以充分捕捉长距离依赖和多模态关系，亟需创新方法提升性能。

Method: 引入Bi-Axial Transformer（BAT），同时关注临床变量和时间点轴线，有效捕捉数据关系并增强模型对缺失值的鲁棒性。

Result: BAT在败血症预测中达到最佳表现，在死亡率分类中表现优异，优于其他Transformer模型，展现出对数据缺失的高度鲁棒性并具有可迁移的传感器嵌入能力。

Conclusion: BAT为EHR数据分析提供了强大工具，提升了疾病预测的准确性和模型的泛化能力，为未来电子健康记录的深度学习应用奠定基础。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs), the digital representation of a patient's
medical history, are a valuable resource for epidemiological and clinical
research. They are also becoming increasingly complex, with recent trends
indicating larger datasets, longer time series, and multi-modal integrations.
Transformers, which have rapidly gained popularity due to their success in
natural language processing and other domains, are well-suited to address these
challenges due to their ability to model long-range dependencies and process
data in parallel. But their application to EHR classification remains limited
by data representations, which can reduce performance or fail to capture
informative missingness. In this paper, we present the Bi-Axial Transformer
(BAT), which attends to both the clinical variable and time point axes of EHR
data to learn richer data relationships and address the difficulties of data
sparsity. BAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on sepsis prediction and is
competitive to top methods for mortality classification. In comparison to other
transformers, BAT demonstrates increased robustness to data missingness, and
learns unique sensor embeddings which can be used in transfer learning.
Baseline models, which were previously located across multiple repositories or
utilized deprecated libraries, were re-implemented with PyTorch and made
available for reproduction and future benchmarking.

Conclusion: 该端到端的CAD到成本流程缩短报价时间，确保成本评估的一致性与透明性，支持工业4.0环境下的实时、智能决策。

Abstract: We present an integrated machine learning framework that transforms how
manufacturing cost is estimated from 2D engineering drawings. Unlike
traditional quotation workflows that require labor-intensive process planning,
our approach about 200 geometric and statistical descriptors directly from
13,684 DWG drawings of automotive suspension and steering parts spanning 24
product groups. Gradient-boosted decision tree models (XGBoost, CatBoost,
LightGBM) trained on these features achieve nearly 10% mean absolute percentage
error across groups, demonstrating robust scalability beyond part-specific
heuristics. By coupling cost prediction with explainability tools such as SHAP,
the framework identifies geometric design drivers including rotated dimension
maxima, arc statistics and divergence metrics, offering actionable insights for
cost-aware design. This end-to-end CAD-to-cost pipeline shortens quotation lead
times, ensures consistent and transparent cost assessments across part families
and provides a deployable pathway toward real-time, ERP-integrated decision
support in Industry 4.0 manufacturing environments.

Result: 在原始数据集和更广泛的基准测试中，该算法均优于现有的自适应均值漂移方法。

Conclusion: 提出的算法有效改善了聚类效果，适应性强，具有较好的实用潜力。

Abstract: This article presents an adaptive mean shift algorithm designed for datasets
with varying local scale and cluster cardinality. Local distance distributions,
from a point to all others, are used to estimate the cardinality of the local
cluster by identifying a local minimum in the density of the distance
distribution. Based on these cardinality estimates, local cluster parameters
are then computed for the entire cluster in contrast to KDE-based methods,
which provide insight only into localized regions of the cluster. During the
mean shift execution, the cluster cardinality estimate is used to adaptively
adjust the bandwidth and the mean shift kernel radius threshold. Our algorithm
outperformed a recently proposed adaptive mean shift method on its original
dataset and demonstrated competitive performance on a broader clustering
benchmark.

TL;DR: Cold-RL是一种结合深度强化学习的自适应网页代理缓存驱逐策略，显著提升了缓存命中率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LRU驱逐策略在面对周期性突发和不同对象大小时易产生频繁驱逐，影响性能。

Method: 采用深度Q网络，离线训练，通过采样最少使用对象，提取特征，实时决策，硬超时机制确保快速响应。

Result: 在不同缓存容量下，Cold-RL显著优于传统方法，最大提升达146%，且引入的开销很小，满足严格的服务水平要求。

Conclusion: Cold-RL成功将强化学习集成到Nginx中，有潜力优化网页代理缓存管理，提升性能。

Abstract: Web proxies such as NGINX commonly rely on least-recently-used (LRU)
eviction, which is size agnostic and can thrash under periodic bursts and mixed
object sizes. We introduce Cold-RL, a learned eviction policy for NGINX that
replaces LRU's forced-expire path with a dueling Deep Q-Network served by an
ONNX sidecar within a strict microsecond budget. On each eviction, Cold-RL
samples the K least-recently-used objects, extracts six lightweight features
(age, size, hit count, inter-arrival time, remaining TTL, and last origin RTT),
and requests a bitmask of victims; a hard timeout of 500 microseconds triggers
immediate fallback to native LRU. Policies are trained offline by replaying
NGINX access logs through a cache simulator with a simple reward: a retained
object earns one point if it is hit again before TTL expiry. We compare against
LRU, LFU, size-based, adaptive LRU, and a hybrid baseline on two adversarial
workloads. With a 25 MB cache, Cold-RL raises hit ratio from 0.1436 to 0.3538,
a 146 percent improvement over the best classical baseline; at 100 MB, from
0.7530 to 0.8675, a 15 percent gain; and at 400 MB it matches classical methods
(about 0.918). Inference adds less than 2 percent CPU overhead and keeps 95th
percentile eviction latency within budget. To our knowledge, this is the first
reinforcement learning eviction policy integrated into NGINX with strict SLOs.

Motivation: 解决当前大模型路由方法忽略提示上下文、依赖昂贵的模型分析、假设固定模型集或使用低效策略的问题。

Method: 引入Cost-Spectrum Contrastive Routing，通过嵌入空间匹配提示和模型，利用简洁的日志特征和对比学习实现快速、成本敏感的模型选择。

Result: 在多个基准上有效提升准确性与成本的平衡，US最高改善达25%，且对未知模型和提示展现强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CSCR是一种高效、便捷的模型路由框架，增强了大模型调度的实用性和适应性。

Abstract: We study cost-aware routing for large language models across diverse and
dynamic pools of models. Existing approaches often overlook prompt-specific
context, rely on expensive model profiling, assume a fixed set of experts, or
use inefficient trial-and-error strategies. We introduce Cost-Spectrum
Contrastive Routing (CSCR), a lightweight framework that maps both prompts and
models into a shared embedding space to enable fast, cost-sensitive selection.
CSCR uses compact, fast-to-compute logit footprints for open-source models and
perplexity fingerprints for black-box APIs. A contrastive encoder is trained to
favor the cheapest accurate expert within adaptive cost bands. At inference
time, routing reduces to a single k-NN lookup via a FAISS index, requiring no
retraining when the expert pool changes and enabling microsecond latency.
Across multiple benchmarks, CSCR consistently outperforms baselines, improving
the accuracy-cost tradeoff by up to 25%, while generalizing robustly to unseen
LLMs and out-of-distribution prompts.

Conclusion: 基于信任域的渐进策略为随机控制优化提供了一种系统且有效的解决方案，能应对目标与先验差异大的挑战。

Abstract: Solving stochastic optimal control problems with quadratic control costs can
be viewed as approximating a target path space measure, e.g. via gradient-based
optimization. In practice, however, this optimization is challenging in
particular if the target measure differs substantially from the prior. In this
work, we therefore approach the problem by iteratively solving constrained
problems incorporating trust regions that aim for approaching the target
measure gradually in a systematic way. It turns out that this trust region
based strategy can be understood as a geometric annealing from the prior to the
target measure, where, however, the incorporated trust regions lead to a
principled and educated way of choosing the time steps in the annealing path.
We demonstrate in multiple optimal control applications that our novel method
can improve performance significantly, including tasks in diffusion-based
sampling, transition path sampling, and fine-tuning of diffusion models.

Conclusion: 提出的LR损失方法能在无需特定架构限制的前提下，有效缓解变分自编码器的后验崩溃问题，改善模型性能。

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs), one of the most widely used generative
models, are known to suffer from posterior collapse, a phenomenon that reduces
the diversity of generated samples. To avoid posterior collapse, many prior
works have tried to control the influence of regularization loss. However, the
trade-off between reconstruction and regularization is not satisfactory. For
this reason, several methods have been proposed to guarantee latent
identifiability, which is the key to avoiding posterior collapse. However, they
require structural constraints on the network architecture. For further
clarification, we define local posterior collapse to reflect the importance of
individual sample points in the data space and to relax the network constraint.
Then, we propose Latent Reconstruction(LR) loss, which is inspired by
mathematical properties of injective and composite functions, to control
posterior collapse without restriction to a specific architecture. We
experimentally evaluate our approach, which controls posterior collapse on
varied datasets such as MNIST, fashionMNIST, Omniglot, CelebA, and FFHQ.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战微调过程中安全性不可避免受损的普遍观点，探究其根源及解决方案。

Method: 系统测试不同超参数的影响，采用指数移动平均（EMA）技术稳定优化路径。

Result: 调整超参数显著降低不安全反应，从16%减少至约5%，且不影响模型实用性；EMA技术保持了预训练模型的安全特性。

Conclusion: 合理选择优化超参数及使用EMA技术可以在不牺牲性能的前提下，有效提升微调后模型的安全性，避免额外安全措施的需求。

Abstract: Fine-tuning language models is commonly believed to inevitably harm their
safety, i.e., refusing to respond to harmful user requests, even when using
harmless datasets, thus requiring additional safety measures. We challenge this
belief through systematic testing, showing that poor optimization choices,
rather than inherent trade-offs, often cause safety problems, measured as
harmful responses to adversarial prompts. By properly selecting key training
hyper-parameters, e.g., learning rate, batch size, and gradient steps, we
reduce unsafe model responses from 16\% to approximately 5\%, as measured by
keyword matching, while maintaining utility performance. Based on this
observation, we propose a simple exponential moving average (EMA) momentum
technique in parameter space that preserves safety performance by creating a
stable optimization path and retains the original pre-trained model's safety
properties. Our experiments on the Llama families across multiple datasets
(Dolly, Alpaca, ORCA) demonstrate that safety problems during fine-tuning can
largely be avoided without specialized interventions, outperforming existing
approaches that require additional safety data while offering practical
guidelines for maintaining both model performance and safety during adaptation.

Abstract: The construction of brain graphs from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) data plays a crucial role in enabling graph machine learning for
neuroimaging. However, current practices often rely on rigid pipelines that
overlook critical data-centric choices in how brain graphs are constructed. In
this work, we adopt a Data-Centric AI perspective and systematically define and
benchmark a data-centric design space for brain graph construction,
constrasting with primarily model-centric prior work. We organize this design
space into three stages: temporal signal processing, topology extraction, and
graph featurization. Our contributions lie less in novel components and more in
evaluating how combinations of existing and modified techniques influence
downstream performance. Specifically, we study high-amplitude BOLD signal
filtering, sparsification and unification strategies for connectivity,
alternative correlation metrics, and multi-view node and edge features, such as
incorporating lagged dynamics. Experiments on the HCP1200 and ABIDE datasets
show that thoughtful data-centric configurations consistently improve
classification accuracy over standard pipelines. These findings highlight the
critical role of upstream data decisions and underscore the importance of
systematically exploring the data-centric design space for graph-based
neuroimaging. Our code is available at

Abstract: Linux kernel tuning is essential for optimizing operating system (OS)
performance. However, existing methods often face challenges in terms of
efficiency, scalability, and generalization. This paper introduces OS-R1, an
agentic Linux kernel tuning framework powered by rule-based reinforcement
learning (RL). By abstracting the kernel configuration space as an RL
environment, OS-R1 facilitates efficient exploration by large language models
(LLMs) and ensures accurate configuration modifications. Additionally, custom
reward functions are designed to enhance reasoning standardization,
configuration modification accuracy, and system performance awareness of the
LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a two-phase training process that accelerates
convergence and minimizes retraining across diverse tuning scenarios.
Experimental results show that OS-R1 significantly outperforms existing
baseline methods, achieving up to 5.6% performance improvement over heuristic
tuning and maintaining high data efficiency. Notably, OS-R1 is adaptable across
various real-world applications, demonstrating its potential for practical
deployment in diverse environments. Our dataset and code are publicly available

Conclusion: 该系统通过多层次分析增强了对编码代理行为的洞察，为自动代码生成的调试提供新工具。

Abstract: Coding agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have gained traction
for automating code generation through iterative problem-solving with minimal
human involvement. Despite the emergence of various frameworks, e.g.,
LangChain, AutoML, and AIDE, ML scientists still struggle to effectively review
and adjust the agents' coding process. The current approach of manually
inspecting individual outputs is inefficient, making it difficult to track code
evolution, compare coding iterations, and identify improvement opportunities.
To address this challenge, we introduce a visual analytics system designed to
enhance the examination of coding agent behaviors. Focusing on the AIDE
framework, our system supports comparative analysis across three levels: (1)
Code-Level Analysis, which reveals how the agent debugs and refines its code
over iterations; (2) Process-Level Analysis, which contrasts different
solution-seeking processes explored by the agent; and (3) LLM-Level Analysis,
which highlights variations in coding behavior across different LLMs. By
integrating these perspectives, our system enables ML scientists to gain a
structured understanding of agent behaviors, facilitating more effective
debugging and prompt engineering. Through case studies using coding agents to
tackle popular Kaggle competitions, we demonstrate how our system provides
valuable insights into the iterative coding process.

Abstract: To address the complexity of financial time series, this paper proposes a

to construct datasets. VMD decomposes non-stationary financial time series into
smoother subcomponents, improving model adaptability. The decomposed data is

Conclusion: 所提出方法有效融合动力学保守性与统计性质，为多尺度模拟提供新路径。

Abstract: Multiscale systems are ubiquitous in science and technology, but are
notoriously challenging to simulate as short spatiotemporal scales must be
appropriately linked to emergent bulk physics. When expensive high-dimensional
dynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic
loss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative,
history-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics
from time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework
using the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by
construction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the
first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a
discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium
statistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before
specializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable
for entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning
strategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on
benchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1)
coarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while
preserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed
video of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local
rearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics. We provide open-source
implementations in both PyTorch and LAMMPS, enabling large-scale inference and
extensibility to diverse particle-based systems.

Abstract: The prediction of amyloidogenicity in peptides and proteins remains a focal
point of ongoing bioinformatics. The crucial step in this field is to apply
advanced computational methodologies. Many recent approaches to predicting
amyloidogenicity within proteins are highly based on evolutionary motifs and
the individual properties of amino acids. It is becoming increasingly evident
that the sequence information-based features show high predictive performance.
Consequently, our study evaluated the contextual features of protein sequences
obtained from a pretrained protein large language model leveraging
bidirectional LSTM and GRU to predict amyloidogenic regions in peptide and
protein sequences. Our method achieved an accuracy of 84.5% on 10-fold
cross-validation and an accuracy of 83% in the test dataset. Our results

Conclusion: 随着网络宽度的增加，联邦学习中的异质性影响减少，达到集中式学习条件。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to train a model
collaboratively without sharing local data. A key distinction between FL and
centralized learning is that clients' data are non-independent and identically
distributed, which poses significant challenges in training a global model that
generalizes well across heterogeneous local data distributions. In this paper,
we analyze the convergence of overparameterized FedAvg with gradient descent
(GD). We prove that the impact of data heterogeneity diminishes as the width of
neural networks increases, ultimately vanishing when the width approaches
infinity. In the infinite-width regime, we further prove that both the global
and local models in FedAvg behave as linear models, and that FedAvg achieves
the same generalization performance as centralized learning with the same
number of GD iterations. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical
findings across various network architectures, loss functions, and optimization
methods.

Abstract: To address the growing demand for on-device LLM inference in
resource-constrained environments, hybrid language models (HLM) have emerged,
combining lightweight local models with powerful cloud-based LLMs. Recent
studies on HLM have primarily focused on improving accuracy and latency, while
often overlooking communication and energy efficiency. We propose a token-level
filtering mechanism for an energy-efficient importance- and uncertainty-aware
HLM inference that leverages both epistemic uncertainty and attention-based
importance. Our method opportunistically uploads only informative tokens,
reducing LLM usage and communication costs. Experiments with TinyLlama-1.1B and
LLaMA-2-7B demonstrate that our method achieves up to 87.5% BERT Score and
token throughput of 0.37 tokens/sec while saving the energy consumption by
40.7% compared to standard HLM. Furthermore, compared to our previous U-HLM
baseline, our method improves BERTScore from 85.8% to 87.0%, energy savings
from 31.6% to 43.6%, and throughput from 0.36 to 0.40. This approach enables an
energy-efficient and accurate deployment of LLMs in bandwidth-constrained edge
environments.

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合物理模型与深度学习，改善交通状态估计的精度和物理一致性，为未来研究提供新的思路。

Abstract: Traffic state estimation (TSE) fundamentally involves solving
high-dimensional spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs) governing
traffic flow dynamics from limited, noisy measurements. While Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) enforce PDE constraints point-wise, this paper adopts a
physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet) framework that
reformulates TSE as an operator learning problem. Our approach trains a
parameterized neural operator that maps sparse input data to the full
spatiotemporal traffic state field, governed by the traffic flow conservation
law. Crucially, unlike PINNs that enforce PDE constraints point-wise,
PI-DeepONet integrates traffic flow conservation model and the fundamental
diagram directly into the operator learning process, ensuring physical
consistency while capturing congestion propagation, spatial correlations, and
temporal evolution. Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate superior
performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals insights
into optimal function generation strategies and branch network complexity.
Additionally, the impact of input function generation methods and the number of
functions on model performance is explored, highlighting the robustness and
efficacy of proposed framework.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of self-attention limits its applicability and
scalability on large unstructured meshes. We introduce Fast Low-rank Attention
Routing Engine (FLARE), a linear complexity self-attention mechanism that
routes attention through fixed-length latent sequences. Each attention head
performs global communication among $N$ tokens by projecting the input sequence
onto a fixed length latent sequence of $M \ll N$ tokens using learnable query
tokens. By routing attention through a bottleneck sequence, FLARE learns a
low-rank form of attention that can be applied at $O(NM)$ cost. FLARE not only
scales to unprecedented problem sizes, but also delivers superior accuracy
compared to state-of-the-art neural PDE surrogates across diverse benchmarks.
We also release a new additive manufacturing dataset to spur further research.

Abstract: We present a hybrid surrogate model for electric vehicle parameter estimation
and power consumption. We combine our novel architecture Spectral Parameter
Operator built on a Fourier Neural Operator backbone for global context and a
differentiable physics module in the forward pass. From speed and acceleration
alone, it outputs time-varying motor and regenerative braking efficiencies, as
well as aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, effective mass, and auxiliary
power. These parameters drive a physics-embedded estimate of battery power,
eliminating any separate physics-residual loss. The modular design lets
representations converge to physically meaningful parameters that reflect the
current state and condition of the vehicle. We evaluate on real-world logs from
a Tesla Model 3, Tesla Model S, and the Kia EV9. The surrogate achieves a mean
absolute error of 0.2kW (about 1% of average traction power at highway speeds)
for Tesla vehicles and about 0.8kW on the Kia EV9. The framework is
interpretable, and it generalizes well to unseen conditions, and sampling
rates, making it practical for path optimization, eco-routing, on-board
diagnostics, and prognostics health management.

Conclusion: SSPO是一种高效、无需辅助标注的推理优化策略，具有良好的应用潜力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has proven effective in further enhancing the performance
of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). However, mainstream post-training
methods (i.e., reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning) often incur substantial computational overhead due to auxiliary
models and overthinking. In this paper, we empirically reveal that the
incorrect answers partially stem from verbose reasoning processes lacking
correct self-fix, where errors accumulate across multiple reasoning steps. To
this end, we propose Self-traced Step-wise Preference Optimization (SSPO), a
pluggable RL process supervision framework that enables fine-grained
optimization of each reasoning step. Specifically, SSPO requires neither
auxiliary models nor stepwise manual annotations. Instead, it leverages
step-wise preference signals generated by the model itself to guide the
optimization process for reasoning compression. Experiments demonstrate that
the generated reasoning sequences from SSPO are both accurate and succinct,
effectively mitigating overthinking behaviors without compromising model
performance across diverse domains and languages.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) algorithms are becoming ubiquitous in everyday life and in
scientific research. However, the price we pay for their impressively accurate
predictions is significant: their inner workings are notoriously opaque - it is
unknown to laypeople and researchers alike what features of the data a DL
system focuses on and how it ultimately succeeds in predicting correct outputs.
A necessary criterion for trustworthy explanations is that they should reflect
the relevant processes the algorithms' predictions are based on. The field of
eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) presents promising methods to create
such explanations. But recent reviews about their performance offer reasons for
skepticism. As we will argue, a good criterion for trustworthiness is
explanatory robustness: different XAI methods produce the same explanations in
comparable contexts. However, in some instances, all methods may give the same,
but still wrong, explanation. We therefore argue that in addition to
explanatory robustness (ER), a prior requirement of explanation method
robustness (EMR) has to be fulfilled by every XAI method. Conversely, the
robustness of an individual method is in itself insufficient for
trustworthiness. In what follows, we develop and formalize criteria for ER as
well as EMR, providing a framework for explaining and establishing trust in DL
algorithms. We also highlight interesting application cases and outline
directions for future work.

state of the art for all-atom, small-molecule generation. Its substantial
performance gains over previous FlowMol versions are achieved without changes
to the graph neural network architecture or the underlying flow matching
formulation. Instead, FlowMol3's improvements arise from three
architecture-agnostic techniques that incur negligible computational cost:
self-conditioning, fake atoms, and train-time geometry distortion. FlowMol3
achieves nearly 100% molecular validity for drug-like molecules with explicit
hydrogens, more accurately reproduces the functional group composition and
geometry of its training data, and does so with an order of magnitude fewer
learnable parameters than comparable methods. We hypothesize that these
techniques mitigate a general pathology affecting transport-based generative
models, enabling detection and correction of distribution drift during
inference. Our results highlight simple, transferable strategies for improving
the stability and quality of diffusion- and flow-based molecular generative
models.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构保留和稳定估计，提高了因果顺序推断和大模型的因果推理能力，无需额外微调。

Abstract: Ordering-based approaches to causal discovery identify topological orders of
causal graphs, providing scalable alternatives to combinatorial search methods.
Under the Additive Noise Model (ANM) assumption, recent causal ordering methods
based on score matching require an accurate estimation of the Hessian diagonal
of the log-densities. However, previous approaches mainly use Stein gradient
estimators, which are computationally expensive and memory-intensive. Although
DiffAN addresses these limitations by substituting kernel-based estimates with
diffusion models, it remains numerically unstable due to the second-order
derivatives of score models. To alleviate these problems, we propose
Score-informed Neural Operator (SciNO), a probabilistic generative model in
smooth function spaces designed to stably approximate the Hessian diagonal and
to preserve structural information during the score modeling. Empirical results
show that SciNO reduces order divergence by 42.7% on synthetic graphs and by
31.5% on real-world datasets on average compared to DiffAN, while maintaining
memory efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, we propose a probabilistic
control algorithm for causal reasoning with autoregressive models that
integrates SciNO's probability estimates with autoregressive model priors,
enabling reliable data-driven causal ordering informed by semantic information.
Consequently, the proposed method enhances causal reasoning abilities of LLMs
without additional fine-tuning or prompt engineering.

Motivation: 解决在拜占庭攻击环境中保障联邦学习模型的鲁棒性问题，利用信任的服务器和少量诚实客户端增强系统安全性。

Result: 算法在不同攻击策略和多个数据集上显著优于现有稳健FL方法，表现出更强的抗攻击能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在确保联邦学习安全性方面具有潜力，尤其适合信任服务器和有限诚实参与者的场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients without sharing private data. We consider FL scenarios wherein FL
clients are subject to adversarial (Byzantine) attacks, while the FL server is
trusted (honest) and has a trustworthy side dataset. This may correspond to,
e.g., cases where the server possesses trusted data prior to federation, or to
the presence of a trusted client that temporarily assumes the server role. Our
approach requires only two honest participants, i.e., the server and one
client, to function effectively, without prior knowledge of the number of
malicious clients. Theoretical analysis demonstrates bounded optimality gaps
even under strong Byzantine attacks. Experimental results show that our
algorithm significantly outperforms standard and robust FL baselines such as
Mean, Trimmed Mean, Median, Krum, and Multi-Krum under various attack
strategies including label flipping, sign flipping, and Gaussian noise addition
across MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 benchmarks using the Flower framework.

Conclusion: HyperFedZero通过分布感知和动态模型生成，有效提升联邦学习在异质性环境中的泛化能力与适应性，具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
privacy-preserving collaborative learning, yet data heterogeneity remains a
critical challenge. While existing methods achieve progress in addressing data
heterogeneity for participating clients, they fail to generalize to
non-participating clients with in-domain distribution shifts and resource
constraints. To mitigate this issue, we present HyperFedZero, a novel method
that dynamically generates specialized models via a hypernetwork conditioned on
distribution-aware embeddings. Our approach explicitly incorporates
distribution-aware inductive biases into the model's forward pass, extracting
robust distribution embeddings using a NoisyEmbed-enhanced extractor with a
Balancing Penalty, effectively preventing feature collapse. The hypernetwork
then leverages these embeddings to generate specialized models chunk-by-chunk
for non-participating clients, ensuring adaptability to their unique data
distributions. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models
demonstrate HyperFedZero's remarkable performance, surpassing competing methods
consistently with minimal computational, storage, and communication overhead.
Moreover, ablation studies and visualizations further validate the necessity of
each component, confirming meaningful adaptations and validating the
effectiveness of HyperFedZero.

Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) can improve data-driven modeling of building thermal

selecting the right source model for TL. However, these research directions
require massive amounts of thermal building data which is lacking presently.
Neither public datasets nor existing data generators meet the needs of TL
research in terms of data quality and quantity. Moreover, existing data
generation approaches typically require expert knowledge in building
simulation. We present BuilDa, a thermal building data generation framework for
producing synthetic data of adequate quality and quantity for TL research. The
framework does not require profound building simulation knowledge to generate
large volumes of data. BuilDa uses a single-zone Modelica model that is
exported as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) and simulated in Python. We
demonstrate BuilDa by generating data and utilizing it for pretraining and
fine-tuning TL models.

Abstract: Connected and automated vehicles generate vast amounts of sensor data daily,
raising significant privacy and communication challenges for centralized
machine learning approaches in perception tasks. This study presents a
decentralized, federated learning framework tailored for traffic sign detection
in vehicular networks to enable collaborative model training without sharing
raw data. The framework partitioned traffic sign classes across vehicles for
specialized local training using lightweight object detectors, aggregated model
parameters via algorithms like FedProx, FedAdam and FedAVG in a simulated
environment with the Flower framework, and evaluated multiple configurations
including varying server rounds, local epochs, client participation fractions,
and data distributions. Experiments demonstrated that increasing server rounds
from 2 to 20 boosted accuracy from below 0.1 to over 0.8, moderate local epochs
(8-10) provided optimal efficiency with accuracies around 0.67, higher client
participation fractions enhanced generalization up to 0.83, FedProx
outperformed other aggregators in handling heterogeneity, non-IID data
distributions reduced performance compared to IID, and training duration
primarily scaled with the number of rounds rather than aggregation strategy. We
conclude that this federated approach may offer a scalable, privacy-preserving
solution for real-world vehicular deployments, potentially guiding future
integrations of robust aggregation and communication optimizations to advance
intelligent transportation systems.

Result: 实验显示FedSODA在通信开销、存储成本方面显著降低，同时提升任务执行精度。

Conclusion: FedSODA为资源有限环境中的大模型联邦微调提供了高效、实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FFT) of large language models (LLMs) has recently
emerged as a promising solution to enable domain-specific adaptation while
preserving data privacy. Despite its benefits, FFT on resource-constrained
clients relies on the high computational and memory demands of full-model
fine-tuning, which limits the potential advancement. This paper presents
FedSODA, a resource-efficient FFT framework that enables clients to adapt LLMs
without accessing or storing the full model. Specifically, we first propose a
similarity group pruning (SGP) module, which prunes redundant layers from the
full LLM while retaining the most critical layers to preserve the model
performance. Moreover, we introduce an orchestrated distillation alignment
(ODA) module to reduce gradient divergence between the sub-LLM and the full LLM
during FFT. Through the use of the QLoRA, clients only need to deploy quantized
sub-LLMs and fine-tune lightweight adapters, significantly reducing local
resource requirements. We conduct extensive experiments on three open-source
LLMs across a variety of downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate
that FedSODA reduces communication overhead by an average of 70.6%, decreases
storage usage by 75.6%, and improves task accuracy by 3.1%, making it highly
suitable for practical FFT applications under resource constraints.

Conclusion: FedUNet有效提升异构环境中的联邦学习效率，为多样化模型架构提供可行方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing
local data. However, most existing methods assume identical model architectures
across clients, limiting their applicability in heterogeneous real-world
environments. To address this, we propose FedUNet, a lightweight and
architecture-agnostic FL framework that attaches a U-Net-inspired additive
module to each client's backbone. By sharing only the compact bottleneck of the
U-Net, FedUNet enables efficient knowledge transfer without structural
alignment. The encoder-decoder design and skip connections in the U-Net help
capture both low-level and high-level features, facilitating the extraction of
clientinvariant representations. This enables cooperative learning between the
backbone and the additive module with minimal communication cost. Experiment
with VGG variants shows that FedUNet achieves 93.11% accuracy and 92.68% in
compact form (i.e., a lightweight version of FedUNet) with only 0.89 MB low
communication overhead.

Abstract: This paper presents preliminary results in the definition of a comprehensive
benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate spatial reasoning
capabilities in neural networks, with a particular focus on morphological
properties such as connectivity and distance relationships. The framework is
currently being used to study the capabilities of nnU-Net, exploiting the
spatial model checker VoxLogicA to generate two distinct categories of
synthetic datasets: maze connectivity problems for topological analysis and
spatial distance computation tasks for geometric understanding. Each category
is evaluated across multiple resolutions to assess scalability and
generalization properties. The automated pipeline encompasses a complete
machine learning workflow including: synthetic dataset generation, standardized
training with cross-validation, inference execution, and comprehensive
evaluation using Dice coefficient and IoU (Intersection over Union) metrics.
Preliminary experimental results demonstrate significant challenges in neural
network spatial reasoning capabilities, revealing systematic failures in basic
geometric and topological understanding tasks. The framework provides a
reproducible experimental protocol, enabling researchers to identify specific
limitations. Such limitations could be addressed through hybrid approaches
combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning methods for improved spatial
understanding in clinical applications, establishing a foundation for ongoing
research into neural network spatial reasoning limitations and potential
solutions.

Abstract: This paper presents Constrained Centroid Clustering (CCC), a method that
extends classical centroid-based clustering by enforcing a constraint on the
maximum distance between the cluster center and the farthest point in the
cluster. Using a Lagrangian formulation, we derive a closed-form solution that
maintains interpretability while controlling cluster spread. To evaluate CCC,
we conduct experiments on synthetic circular data with radial symmetry and
uniform angular distribution. Using ring-wise, sector-wise, and joint entropy
as evaluation metrics, we show that CCC achieves more compact clusters by
reducing radial spread while preserving angular structure, outperforming
standard methods such as K-means and GMM. The proposed approach is suitable for
applications requiring structured clustering with spread control, including
sensor networks, collaborative robotics, and interpretable pattern analysis.

Abstract: A novel methodology for short-term energy forecasting using an Extreme
Learning Machine ($\mathtt{ELM}$) is proposed. Using six years of hourly data
collected in Corsica (France) from multiple energy sources (solar, wind, hydro,
thermal, bioenergy, and imported electricity), our approach predicts both
individual energy outputs and total production (\cyr{including imports, which
closely follow energy demand, modulo losses)} through a Multi-Input
Multi-Output ($\mathtt{MIMO}$) architecture. To address non-stationarity and
seasonal variability, sliding window techniques and cyclic time encoding are
incorporated, enabling dynamic adaptation to fluctuations. The $\mathtt{ELM}$
model significantly outperforms persistence-based forecasting, particularly for
solar and thermal energy, achieving an $\mathtt{nRMSE}$ of $17.9\%$ and
$5.1\%$, respectively, with $\mathtt{R^2} > 0.98$ (1-hour horizon). The model
maintains high accuracy up to five hours ahead, beyond which renewable energy
sources become increasingly volatile. While $\mathtt{MIMO}$ provides marginal
gains over Single-Input Single-Output ($\mathtt{SISO}$) architectures and
offers key advantages over deep learning methods such as $\mathtt{LSTM}$, it
provides a closed-form solution with lower computational demands, making it
well-suited for real-time applications, including online learning. Beyond
predictive accuracy, the proposed methodology is adaptable to various contexts
and datasets, as it can be tuned to local constraints such as resource
availability, grid characteristics, and market structures.

Abstract: In the swiftly evolving domain of cloud computing, the advent of serverless
systems underscores the crucial need for predictive auto-scaling systems. This
necessity arises to ensure optimal resource allocation and maintain operational
efficiency in inherently volatile environments. At the core of a predictive
auto-scaling system is the workload forecasting model. Existing forecasting
models struggle to quickly adapt to the dynamics in online workload streams and
have difficulty capturing the complex periodicity brought by fine-grained,
high-frequency forecasting tasks. Addressing this, we propose a novel online
ensemble model, E3Former, for online workload forecasting in large-scale
predictive auto-scaling. Our model synergizes the predictive capabilities of
multiple subnetworks to surmount the limitations of single-model approaches,
thus ensuring superior accuracy and robustness. Remarkably, it accomplishes
this with a minimal increase in computational overhead, adhering to the lean
operational ethos of serverless systems. Through extensive experimentation on
real-world workload datasets, we establish the efficacy of our ensemble model.
In online forecasting tasks, the proposed method reduces forecast error by an
average of 10%, and its effectiveness is further demonstrated through a
predictive auto-scaling test in the real-life online system. Currently, our
method has been deployed within ByteDance's Intelligent Horizontal Pod
Auto-scaling (IHPA) platform, which supports the stable operation of over 30
applications, such as Douyin E-Comerce, TouTiao, and Volcano Engine. The
predictive auto-scaling capacity reaching over 600,000 CPU cores. On the basis
of essentially ensuring service quality, the predictive auto-scaling system can
reduce resource utilization by over 40%.

Conclusion: 引入物理灵感的二阶波动动力学机制，有助于改善Transformer模型的表现，为深层模型的设计提供新思路。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across natural language
processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). However, deep transformer models
often suffer from an over-smoothing issue, in which token representations
converge to similar values as they pass through successive transformer blocks.
In this paper, we establish an equivalence between the hidden-state dynamics
induced by stacked attention layers and graph neural diffusion on a complete
graph. From this perspective, over-smoothing can be interpreted as a
consequence of the dissipative nature of the underlying diffusion dynamics.
Motivated by this physical interpretation, we propose Wavy Transformer, which
consists of a novel attention layer based on second-order wavy dynamics. We
also introduce a feed-forward network and a normalization layer designed to
preserve the physical state-velocity relationship under the chain rule, thereby
extending the transformer architecture. We further validate our proposed
techniques on various transformer models for NLP and CV tasks. The results
consistently demonstrate that Wavy Transformer improves performance with
minimal additional parameters and no extra hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: Bridge提供了一种简单、有效的方法，改善和理解LLM评价中的偏差，推动模型评估的可靠性和一致性。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used as judges (LLM-as-a-judge) to
evaluate model outputs at scale, but their assessments often diverge
systematically from human judgments. We present Bridge, a unified statistical
framework that explicitly bridges human and LLM evaluations under both absolute
scoring and pairwise comparison paradigms. Bridge posits a latent human
preference score for each prompt-response pair and models LLM deviations as
linear transformations of covariates that capture sources of discrepancies.
This offers a simple and principled framework for refining LLM ratings and
characterizing systematic discrepancies between humans and LLMs. We provide an
efficient fitting algorithm with asymptotic guarantees for statistical
inference. Using six LLM judges and two benchmarks (BigGen Bench and Chatbot
Arena), Bridge achieves higher agreement with human ratings (accuracy,
calibration, and KL divergence) and exposes systematic human-LLM gaps.

constraint to ensure GPU-friendly computation. However, this leads to token
dropping when capacity is saturated and results in low hardware efficiency due
to padding in underutilized experts. Removing the capacity constraint, in turn,
compromises load balancing and computational efficiency. To address these
issues, we propose Maximum Score Routing ($\mathbf{MaxScore}$), a novel MoE
routing paradigm that models routing as a minimum-cost maximum-flow problem and
integrates a SoftTopk operator. MaxScore resolves the fundamental limitations
of iterative rerouting and optimal transport formulations, achieving lower
training losses and higher evaluation scores at equivalent FLOPs compared to
both constrained and unconstrained baselines. Implementation details and
experimental configurations can be obtained from

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大模型中的细粒度引导方法，以应对不同场景中的行为控制和安全需求。

Method: 使用对比输入引导的线性偏移，通过训练辅助模块预测输入特定的微调向量，提升模型的行为控制能力。

Result: L2S在降低虚假幻觉和增强安全性方面优于其他静态基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的L2S方法在多模态大模型的行为引导中具有显著优势，有助于模型更好地适应不同任务和场景。

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a practical approach to enable post-hoc guidance of
LLMs towards enforcing a specific behavior. However, it remains largely
underexplored for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs); furthermore, existing steering
techniques, such as mean steering, rely on a single steering vector, applied
independently of the input query. This paradigm faces limitations when the
desired behavior is dependent on the example at hand. For example, a safe
answer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal
activity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert
when asked about medical advice. In this paper, we investigate a fine-grained
steering that uses an input-specific linear shift. This shift is computed using
contrastive input-specific prompting. However, the input-specific prompts
required for this approach are not known at test time. Therefore, we propose to
train a small auxiliary module to predict the input-specific steering vector.
Our approach, dubbed as L2S (Learn-to-Steer), demonstrates that it reduces
hallucinations and enforces safety in MLLMs, outperforming other static
baselines.

Abstract: On-device machine learning is often constrained by limited storage,
particularly in continuous data collection scenarios. This paper presents an
empirical study on storage-aware learning, focusing on the trade-off between
data quantity and quality via compression. We demonstrate that naive
strategies, such as uniform data dropping or one-size-fits-all compression, are
suboptimal. Our findings further reveal that data samples exhibit varying
sensitivities to compression, supporting the feasibility of a sample-wise
adaptive compression strategy. These insights provide a foundation for
developing a new class of storage-aware learning systems. The primary
contribution of this work is the systematic characterization of this
under-explored challenge, offering valuable insights that advance the
understanding of storage-aware learning.

Conclusion: 子n-gram模型在训练中表现出近站点特性，揭示了损失景观的结构，从而理解模型的学习动态。

Abstract: Motivated by empirical observations of prolonged plateaus and stage-wise
progression during training, we investigate the loss landscape of transformer
models trained on in-context next-token prediction tasks. In particular, we
focus on learning in-context $n$-gram language models under cross-entropy loss,
and establish a sufficient condition for parameter configurations to be
stationary points. We then construct a set of parameter configurations for a
simplified transformer model that represent $k$-gram estimators (for $k \leq
n$), and show that the gradient of the population loss at these solutions
vanishes in the limit of infinite sequence length and parameter norm. This
reveals a key property of the loss landscape: {sub-$n$-grams are
near-stationary points of the population cross-entropy loss}, offering
theoretical insight into widely observed phenomena such as stage-wise learning
dynamics and emergent phase transitions. These insights are further supported
by numerical experiments that illustrate the learning dynamics of $n$-grams,
characterized by discrete transitions between near-stationary solutions.

Result: 在四个真实数据集上优于十个基线模型，SLA违反率降低63.1%，利润损失降低32.3%。

Conclusion: HRS通过融合多模态信息与调度导向的优化，有效提升云边平台的负载预测和资源调度性能。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of streaming services, network load exhibits
highly time-varying and bursty behavior, posing serious challenges for
maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) in Crowdsourced Cloud-Edge Platforms
(CCPs). While CCPs leverage Predict-then-Schedule architecture to improve QoS
and profitability, accurate load forecasting remains challenging under traffic
surges. Existing methods either minimize mean absolute error, resulting in
underprovisioning and potential Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations during
peak periods, or adopt conservative overprovisioning strategies, which mitigate
SLA risks at the expense of increased resource expenditure. To address this
dilemma, we propose HRS, a hybrid representation framework with scheduling
awareness that integrates numerical and image-based representations to better
capture extreme load dynamics. We further introduce a Scheduling-Aware Loss
(SAL) that captures the asymmetric impact of prediction errors, guiding
predictions that better support scheduling decisions. Extensive experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that HRS consistently outperforms ten
baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing SLA violation
rates by 63.1% and total profit loss by 32.3%.

Abstract: With the growing digitalization all over the globe, the relevance of network
security becomes increasingly important. Machine learning-based intrusion
detection constitutes a promising approach for improving security, but it bears
several challenges. These include the requirement to detect novel and unseen
network events, as well as specific data properties, such as events over time
together with the inherent graph structure of network communication. In this
work, we propose a novel intrusion detection method, TGN-SVDD, which builds
upon modern dynamic graph modelling and deep anomaly detection. We demonstrate
its superiority over several baselines for realistic intrusion detection data
and suggest a more challenging variant of the latter.

TL;DR: TCUQ是一种适用于TinyML的无标签不确定性监控方法，通过短期时间一致性和流式校准实现高效、资源节省的设备监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决TinyML设备在资源有限情况下进行准确不确定性监控的难题。

Method: 结合短期时间一致性的信号与流式校准技术，利用环形缓冲区实现单次传递监控，无需在线标签或额外前向，适配微控制器。

Result: 显著降低模型体积和延迟，提升在受污染数据流中的检测准确性，达成高效、精确的监控效果。

Conclusion: 利用时间一致性和流式校准，为TinyML设备提供实用、高效的监控方法，适应边缘设备的资源限制。

Abstract: We introduce TCUQ, a single pass, label free uncertainty monitor for
streaming TinyML that converts short horizon temporal consistency captured via
lightweight signals on posteriors and features into a calibrated risk score
with an O(W ) ring buffer and O(1) per step updates. A streaming conformal
layer turns this score into a budgeted accept/abstain rule, yielding calibrated
behavior without online labels or extra forward passes. On microcontrollers,
TCUQ fits comfortably on kilobyte scale devices and reduces footprint and
latency versus early exit and deep ensembles (typically about 50 to 60% smaller
and about 30 to 45% faster), while methods of similar accuracy often run out of
memory. Under corrupted in distribution streams, TCUQ improves accuracy drop
detection by 3 to 7 AUPRC points and reaches up to 0.86 AUPRC at high
severities; for failure detection it attains up to 0.92 AUROC. These results
show that temporal consistency, coupled with streaming conformal calibration,
provides a practical and resource efficient foundation for on device monitoring
in TinyML.

Motivation: 随着稀疏张量代数在大数据和机器学习中的应用增长，设计高效的稀疏张量加速器变得迫在眉睫。

Method: 结合映射策略和稀疏策略，提出进化策略框架SparseMap，并优化编码和操作以高效探索庞大搜索空间。

Result: SparseMap在多个指标上优于现有方法，找到更优设计方案，验证其效率和效果。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了大型、复杂设计空间的优化难题，为稀疏张量加速器设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: The growing demand for sparse tensor algebra (SpTA) in machine learning and
big data has driven the development of various sparse tensor accelerators.
However, most existing manually designed accelerators are limited to specific
scenarios, and it's time-consuming and challenging to adjust a large number of
design factors when scenarios change. Therefore, automating the design of SpTA
accelerators is crucial. Nevertheless, previous works focus solely on either
mapping (i.e., tiling communication and computation in space and time) or
sparse strategy (i.e., bypassing zero elements for efficiency), leading to
suboptimal designs due to the lack of comprehensive consideration of both. A
unified framework that jointly optimizes both is urgently needed. However,
integrating mapping and sparse strategies leads to a combinatorial explosion in
the design space(e.g., as large as $O(10^{41})$ for the workload $P_{32 \times
64} \times Q_{64 \times 48} = Z_{32 \times 48}$). This vast search space
renders most conventional optimization methods (e.g., particle swarm
optimization, reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search) inefficient.
To address this challenge, we propose an evolution strategy-based sparse tensor
accelerator optimization framework, called SparseMap. SparseMap constructing a
more comprehensive design space with the consideration of both mapping and
sparse strategy. We introduce a series of enhancements to genetic encoding and
evolutionary operators, enabling SparseMap to efficiently explore the vast and
diverse design space. We quantitatively compare SparseMap with prior works and
classical optimization methods, demonstrating that SparseMap consistently finds
superior solutions.

Motivation: TinyML设备对计算资源有限，需要高效且无需额外存储的不确定性检测方法。

Result: 在视觉和音频任务中展现出优异的性能，显著减少存储和延迟，优于早期退出和深度集成方法，并在噪声污染环境下保持稳定检测能力。

Conclusion: 基于层到层动态的模型不确定性隐含丰富信息，提供一种实用的资源高效的小型设备监控方案。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{SNAP-UQ}, a single-pass, label-free uncertainty method
for TinyML that estimates risk from \emph{depth-wise next-activation
prediction}: tiny int8 heads forecast the statistics of the next layer from a
compressed view of the previous one, and a lightweight monotone mapper turns
the resulting surprisal into an actionable score. The design requires no
temporal buffers, auxiliary exits, or repeated forward passes, and adds only a
few tens of kilobytes to MCU deployments. Across vision and audio backbones,
SNAP-UQ consistently reduces flash and latency relative to early-exit and deep
ensembles (typically $\sim$40--60\% smaller and $\sim$25--35\% faster), with
competing methods of similar accuracy often exceeding memory limits. In
corrupted streams it improves accuracy-drop detection by several AUPRC points
and maintains strong failure detection (AUROC $\approx$0.9) in a single pass.
Grounding uncertainty in layer-to-layer dynamics yields a practical,
resource-efficient basis for on-device monitoring in TinyML.

Abstract: We propose Fed-DPRoC, a novel federated learning framework that
simultaneously ensures differential privacy (DP), Byzantine robustness, and
communication efficiency. We introduce the concept of robust-compatible
compression, which enables users to compress DP-protected updates while
maintaining the robustness of the aggregation rule. We instantiate our
framework as RobAJoL, combining the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) transform for
compression with robust averaging for robust aggregation. We theoretically
prove the compatibility of JL transform with robust averaging and show that
RobAJoL preserves robustness guarantees, ensures DP, and reduces communication
cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion MNIST validate our theoretical claims
and demonstrate that RobAJoL outperforms existing methods in terms of
robustness and utility under different Byzantine attacks.

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表现优异，比现有方法在达到目标精度时间上更短。

Conclusion: SL-ACC通过优化通信流程，有效提升了联邦学习中的模型训练速度，适应资源有限的场景需求。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of neural networks poses a significant barrier to
the deployment of distributed machine learning (ML) on resource-constrained
devices, such as federated learning (FL). Split learning (SL) offers a
promising solution by offloading the primary computing load from edge devices
to a server via model partitioning. However, as the number of participating
devices increases, the transmission of excessive smashed data (i.e.,
activations and gradients) becomes a major bottleneck for SL, slowing down the
model training. To tackle this challenge, we propose a communication-efficient
SL framework, named SL-ACC, which comprises two key components: adaptive
channel importance identification (ACII) and channel grouping compression
(CGC). ACII first identifies the contribution of each channel in the smashed
data to model training using Shannon entropy. Following this, CGC groups the
channels based on their entropy and performs group-wise adaptive compression to
shrink the transmission volume without compromising training accuracy.
Extensive experiments across various datasets validate that our proposed SL-ACC
framework takes considerably less time to achieve a target accuracy than
state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Result: Fiedler值能有效预测GCN性能，且相似的Fiedler值对应类似的结构和表现。

Conclusion: Fiedler值是衡量图结构特性的重要指标，有助于指导图神经网络的设计和迁移学习。

Abstract: A common observation in the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) literature is
that stacking GCN layers may or may not result in better performance on tasks
like node classification and edge prediction. We have found empirically that a
graph's algebraic connectivity, which is known as the Fiedler value, is a good
predictor of GCN performance. Intuitively, graphs with similar Fiedler values
have analogous structural properties, suggesting that the same filters and
hyperparameters may yield similar results when used with GCNs, and that
transfer learning may be more effective between graphs with similar algebraic
connectivity. We explore this theoretically and empirically with experiments on
synthetic and real graph data, including the Cora, CiteSeer and Polblogs
datasets. We explore multiple ways of aggregating the Fiedler value for
connected components in the graphs to arrive at a value for the entire graph,
and show that it can be used to predict GCN performance. We also present
theoretical arguments as to why the Fiedler value is a good predictor.

Motivation: 现有神经网络在物理相关问题中的训练受梯度波动影响较大，导致损失不稳定和梯度尖峰，亟需更稳健的优化方法。

Method: 提出一种基于Adam风格的优化器，通过层级动态调节beta2值，引入“sunspike”比率以适应梯度波动，并结合多种调节机制。

Result: 在多种物理模拟和文本任务中，该方法显著提升了训练稳定性和最终性能，尤其在处理梯度尖峰时表现优越，且运行成本低。

Conclusion: Kourkoutas-Beta优化器有效增强了神经网络在物理问题中的鲁棒性，兼容现有Adam优化器，适应性强，应用前景广泛。

Abstract: Transformer neural networks are increasingly used for physics-based problems.
In data-driven PDE surrogates, training samples from varying boundary and
initial conditions can cause erratic losses and spiky gradients; in
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), stiff composite losses amplify this
effect.
  We introduce Kourkoutas-Beta, an Adam-style optimizer where the fixed
second-moment discount beta2 is replaced by a layer-wise dynamic value driven
by a bounded ``sunspike'' ratio: the current pooled gradient norm divided by an
exponential moving average (EMA) of past norms, squashed to the interval [0,1).
Spikes lower beta2 toward beta2_min; calm phases keep it near beta2_max.
Options include leaky-AMSGrad (decay), trust-region clipping (max_ratio),
adaptive tiny terms, and several bias-correction modes ``none'', ``beta2max'',
``exact'). With all features off and bias_correction=``none'', the method is
exactly Adam.
  We test on four settings: (i) a Transformer PDE surrogate (Heat2D), (ii) a 3D
PINN for heat conduction (Heat3D), (iii) a lightweight MLX synthetic task with
jitter and rare-trigger bursts, and (iv) a character-level Transformer on 30 MB
of enwik8 (small-enwik8). Kourkoutas-Beta improves stability and final loss
versus fixed-beta2 Adam. On small-enwik8 it lowers bits-per-character by about
38% vs Adam-0.95 and about 58% vs Adam-0.999 over 10 seeds, with smaller
variance. The method remains drop-in, with runtime overhead comparable to Adam
in testbeds A-C and within single-digit percent in testbed D. It preserves
Adam-style convergence guarantees while improving robustness under spiky
gradients.

Conclusion: FAML通过多机制共同作用，提高多视角证据融合的公平性和可靠性，为多视角学习提供新思路。

Abstract: Multi-view evidential learning aims to integrate information from multiple
views to improve prediction performance and provide trustworthy uncertainty
esitimation. Most previous methods assume that view-specific evidence learning
is naturally reliable. However, in practice, the evidence learning process
tends to be biased. Through empirical analysis on real-world data, we reveal
that samples tend to be assigned more evidence to support data-rich classes,
thereby leading to unreliable uncertainty estimation in predictions. This
motivates us to delve into a new Biased Evidential Multi-view Learning (BEML)
problem. To this end, we propose Fairness-Aware Multi-view Evidential Learning
(FAML). FAML first introduces an adaptive prior based on training trajectory,
which acts as a regularization strategy to flexibly calibrate the biased
evidence learning process. Furthermore, we explicitly incorporate a fairness
constraint based on class-wise evidence variance to promote balanced evidence
allocation. In the multi-view fusion stage, we propose an opinion alignment
mechanism to mitigate view-specific bias across views, thereby encouraging the
integration of consistent and mutually supportive evidence. Extensive
experiments on five real-world multi-view datasets demonstrate that FAML
achieves more balanced evidence allocation and improves both prediction
performance and the reliability of uncertainty estimation compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MCFRCL为持续学习提供了一种高效且准确的正则化框架，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is crucial for the adaptation of neural network
models to new environments. Although outperforming weight-space regularisation
approaches, the functional regularisation-based CL methods suffer from high
computational costs and large linear approximation errors. In this work, we
present a new functional regularisation CL framework, called MCFRCL, which
approximates model prediction distributions by Monte Carlo (MC) sampling.
Moreover, three continuous distributions are leveraged to capture the
statistical characteristics of the MC samples via moment-based methods.
Additionally, both the Wasserstein distance and the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
distance are employed to construct the regularisation function. The proposed
MCFRCL is evaluated against multiple benchmark methods on the MNIST and CIFAR
datasets, with simulation results highlighting its effectiveness in both
prediction accuracy and training efficiency.

Abstract: Cyberattacks are increasing, and securing against such threats is costing
industries billions of dollars annually. Threat Modeling, that is,
comprehending the consequences of these attacks, can provide critical support
to cybersecurity professionals, enabling them to take timely action and
allocate resources that could be used elsewhere. Cybersecurity is heavily
dependent on threat modeling, as it assists security experts in assessing and
mitigating risks related to identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Recently,
there has been a pressing need for automated methods to assess attack
descriptions and forecast the future consequences of the increasing complexity
of cyberattacks. This study examines how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
deep learning can be applied to analyze the potential impact of cyberattacks by
leveraging textual descriptions from the MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration
(CWE) database. We emphasize classifying attack consequences into five
principal categories: Availability, Access Control, Confidentiality, Integrity,
and Other. This paper investigates the use of Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) in combination with Hierarchical
Attention Networks (HANs) for Multi-label classification, evaluating their
performance in comparison with conventional CNN and LSTM-based models.
Experimental findings show that BERT achieves an overall accuracy of $0.972$,
far higher than conventional deep learning models in multi-label
classification. HAN outperforms baseline forms of CNN and LSTM-based models on
specific cybersecurity labels. However, BERT consistently achieves better
precision and recall, making it more suitable for predicting the consequences
of a cyberattack.

TL;DR: 本论文提出一种使用分散数据估算模型公平性的方法，应对因数据获取限制带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保AI系统在高风险领域的公平性受到法规和实际限制的双重推动，迫切需要有效的公平性测试方法。

Method: 利用可用的内部和外部数据，估算可能的联合分布，从而计算公平指标的合理范围。

Result: 通过模拟和实际实验，验证了该方法可以提供有意义的公平性指标界限和可靠估计。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据受限时提供了实用的公平性检测方案，有助于推动公平AI的合规实施。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in AI systems is critical, especially in high-stakes
domains such as lending, hiring, and healthcare. This urgency is reflected in
emerging global regulations that mandate fairness assessments and independent
bias audits. However, procuring the necessary complete data for fairness
testing remains a significant challenge. In industry settings, legal and
privacy concerns restrict the collection of demographic data required to assess
group disparities, and auditors face practical and cultural challenges in
gaining access to data. In practice, data relevant for fairness testing is
often split across separate sources: internal datasets held by institutions
with predictive attributes, and external public datasets such as census data
containing protected attributes, each providing only partial, marginal
information. Our work seeks to leverage such available separate data to
estimate model fairness when complete data is inaccessible. We propose
utilising the available separate data to estimate a set of feasible joint
distributions and then compute the set plausible fairness metrics. Through
simulation and real experiments, we demonstrate that we can derive meaningful
bounds on fairness metrics and obtain reliable estimates of the true metric.
Our results demonstrate that this approach can serve as a practical and
effective solution for fairness testing in real-world settings where access to
complete data is restricted.

Motivation: 解决多变量时间序列需求预测中的评价偏差和模型鲁棒性问题，优化预测模型性能。

Method: 对比FMAE和HEF两种自定义评估函数，通过不同数据分割和优化算法，评估模型的拟合能力、准确性、鲁棒性和效率。

Result: HEF在全局指标上优越，增强模型的鲁棒性和解释力；FMAE在局部指标和执行速度方面有优势。

Conclusion: HEF适合战略决策，FMAE适合日常操作，提出了一套可复制的动态环境模型优化框架。

Abstract: Demand forecasting is essential for strategic planning in competitive
environments, enabling resource optimization and improved responsiveness to
market dynamics. However, multivariate time series modeling faces challenges
due to data complexity, uncertainty, and frequent regime shifts. Traditional
evaluation metrics can introduce biases and limit generalization. This work
compares two custom evaluation functions: FMAE (Focused Mean Absolute Error),
focused on minimizing absolute errors, and HEF (Hierarchical Evaluation
Function), designed to weight global metrics and penalize large deviations.
Experiments were conducted under different data splits (91:9, 80:20, 70:30)
using three optimizers (Grid Search, PSO, Optuna), assessing fit, relative
accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Results show that HEF
consistently outperforms FMAE in global metrics (R2, Relative Accuracy, RMSE,
RMSSE), enhancing model robustness and explanatory power. These findings were
confirmed via visualizations and statistical tests. Conversely, FMAE offers
advantages in local metrics (MAE, MASE) and execution time, making it suitable
for short-term scenarios. The study highlights a methodological trade-off: HEF
is ideal for strategic planning, while FMAE is better suited for operational
efficiency. A replicable framework is proposed for optimizing predictive models
in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: 提出的方法结合误差建模和交互式分布构建，有助于深入理解模拟输出与参数之间的关系。

Abstract: Recently, neural surrogate models have emerged as a compelling alternative to
traditional simulation workflows. This is accomplished by modeling the
underlying function of scientific simulations, removing the need to run
expensive simulations. Beyond just mapping from input parameter to output,
surrogates have also been shown useful for inverse problems: output to input
parameters. Inverse problems can be understood as search, where we aim to find
parameters whose surrogate outputs contain a specified feature. Yet finding
these parameters can be costly, especially for high-dimensional parameter
spaces. Thus, existing surrogate-based solutions primarily focus on finding a
small set of matching parameters, in the process overlooking the broader
picture of plausible parameters. Our work aims to model and visualize the
distribution of possible input parameters that produce a given output feature.
To achieve this goal, we aim to address two challenges: (1) the approximation
error inherent in the surrogate model and (2) forming the parameter
distribution in an interactive manner. We model error via density estimation,
reporting high density only if a given parameter configuration is close to
training parameters, measured both over the input and output space. Our density
estimate is used to form a prior belief on parameters, and when combined with a
likelihood on features, gives us an efficient way to sample plausible parameter
configurations that generate a target output feature. We demonstrate the
usability of our solution through a visualization interface by performing
feature-driven parameter analysis over the input parameter space of three
simulation datasets. Source code is available at

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for classifying and detecting spatial
commission outliers in maritime environments using seabed acoustic sensor
networks and log Gaussian Cox processes (LGCPs). By modeling target arrivals as
a mixture of normal and outlier processes, we estimate the probability that a
newly observed event is an outlier. We propose a second-order approximation of
this probability that incorporates both the mean and variance of the normal
intensity function, providing improved classification accuracy compared to
mean-only approaches. We analytically show that our method yields a tighter
bound to the true probability using Jensen's inequality. To enhance detection,
we integrate a real-time, near-optimal sensor placement strategy that
dynamically adjusts sensor locations based on the evolving outlier intensity.
The proposed framework is validated using real ship traffic data near Norfolk,
Virginia, where numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in improving both classification performance and outlier detection through
sensor deployment.

Abstract: Calibration requires that predictions are conditionally unbiased and,
therefore, reliably interpretable as probabilities. Calibration measures
quantify how far a predictor is from perfect calibration. As introduced by
Haghtalab et al. (2024), a calibration measure is truthful if it is minimized
in expectation when a predictor outputs the ground-truth probabilities.
Although predicting the true probabilities guarantees perfect calibration, in
reality, when calibration is evaluated on a finite sample, predicting the truth
is not guaranteed to minimize any known calibration measure. All known
calibration measures incentivize predictors to lie in order to appear more
calibrated on a finite sample. Such lack of truthfulness motivated Haghtalab et
al. (2024) and Qiao and Zhao (2025) to construct approximately truthful
calibration measures in the sequential prediction setting, but no perfectly
truthful calibration measure was known to exist even in the more basic batch
setting.
  We design a perfectly truthful calibration measure in the batch setting:
averaged two-bin calibration error (ATB). In addition to being truthful, ATB is
sound, complete, continuous, and quadratically related to two existing
calibration measures: the smooth calibration error (smCal) and the (lower)
distance to calibration (distCal). The simplicity in our definition of ATB
makes it efficient and straightforward to compute. ATB allows faster estimation
algorithms with significantly easier implementations than smCal and distCal,
achieving improved running time and simplicity for the calibration testing
problem studied by Hu et al. (2024). We also introduce a general recipe for
constructing truthful measures, which proves the truthfulness of ATB as a
special case and allows us to construct other truthful calibration measures
such as quantile-binned l_2-ECE.

Conclusion: CGPT模型通过结合因果知识和双变量策略，有效平衡了模型的专用性和通用性，为工业系统时间序列建模提供了新途径。

Abstract: Foundational modelling of multi-dimensional time-series data in industrial
systems presents a central trade-off: channel-dependent (CD) models capture
specific cross-variable dynamics but lack robustness and adaptability as model
layers are commonly bound to the data dimensionality of the tackled use-case,
while channel-independent (CI) models offer generality at the cost of modelling
the explicit interactions crucial for system-level predictive regression tasks.
To resolve this, we propose the Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer (CGPT), a
novel architecture that integrates a known causal graph as an inductive bias.
The core of CGPT is built around a pairwise modeling paradigm, tackling the
CD/CI conflict by decomposing the multidimensional data into pairs. The model
uses channel-agnostic learnable layers where all parameter dimensions are
independent of the number of variables. CGPT enforces a CD information flow at
the pair-level and CI-like generalization across pairs. This approach
disentangles complex system dynamics and results in a highly flexible
architecture that ensures scalability and any-variate adaptability. We validate
CGPT on a suite of synthetic and real-world industrial datasets on long-term
and one-step forecasting tasks designed to simulate common industrial
complexities. Results demonstrate that CGPT significantly outperforms both CI
and CD baselines in predictive accuracy and shows competitive performance with
end-to-end trained CD models while remaining agnostic to the problem
dimensionality.

Abstract: In classical AI, perception relies on learning state-based representations,
while planning, which can be thought of as temporal reasoning over action
sequences, is typically achieved through search. We study whether such
reasoning can instead emerge from representations that capture both perceptual
and temporal structure. We show that standard temporal contrastive learning,
despite its popularity, often fails to capture temporal structure due to its
reliance on spurious features. To address this, we introduce Combinatorial
Representations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR), a method that uses a negative
sampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate
temporal reasoning. CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex
temporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik's Cube. In particular, for the
Rubik's Cube, CRTR learns representations that generalize across all initial
states and allow it to solve the puzzle using fewer search steps than BestFS,
though with longer solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first method that
efficiently solves arbitrary Cube states using only learned representations,
without relying on an external search algorithm.

Abstract: Individual-level human mobility prediction has emerged as a significant topic
of research with applications in infectious disease monitoring, child, and
elderly care. Existing studies predominantly focus on the microscopic aspects
of human trajectories: such as predicting short-term trajectories or the next
location visited, while offering limited attention to macro-level mobility
patterns and the corresponding life routines. In this paper, we focus on an
underexplored problem in human mobility prediction: determining the best
practices to train a machine learning model using historical data to forecast
an individuals complete trajectory over the next days and weeks. In this
experiment paper, we undertake a comprehensive experimental analysis of diverse
models, parameter configurations, and training strategies, accompanied by an
in-depth examination of the statistical distribution inherent in human mobility
patterns. Our empirical evaluations encompass both Long Short-Term Memory and
Transformer-based architectures, and further investigate how incorporating
individual life patterns can enhance the effectiveness of the prediction. We
show that explicitly including semantic information such as day-of-the-week and
user-specific historical information can help the model better understand
individual patterns of life and improve predictions. Moreover, since the
absence of explicit user information is often missing due to user privacy, we
show that the sampling of users may exacerbate data skewness and result in a
substantial loss in predictive accuracy. To mitigate data imbalance and
preserve diversity, we apply user semantic clustering with stratified sampling
to ensure that the sampled dataset remains representative. Our results further
show that small-batch stochastic gradient optimization improves model
performance, especially when human mobility training data is limited.

Conclusion: 通过重视训练与推理的一致性，显著改善扩散模型的性能，展示了未来研究的潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion language models, as a promising alternative to traditional
autoregressive (AR) models, enable faster generation and richer conditioning on
bidirectional context. However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between
training and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the
structure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens,
whereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random.
Although this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal
performance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing
this gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the
problem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential
decision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement
learning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to
exploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model
under the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches
the performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer
gradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and
54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight
updates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in
inference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine
tokens flexibly. This simple yet effective training-free strategy, what we
refer to as RCR, consistently improves performance and yields additional gains
when combined with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for
investigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs.

Conclusion: 通过引入可学习的假负样本判断机制，显著提升了密集检索的性能表现。

Abstract: In dense retrieval, effective training hinges on selecting high quality hard
negatives while avoiding false negatives. Recent methods apply heuristics based
on positive document scores to identify hard negatives, improving both
performance and interpretability. However, these global, example agnostic
strategies often miss instance specific false negatives. To address this, we
propose a learnable adapter module that monitors Bi-Encoder representations to
estimate the likelihood that a hard negative is actually a false negative. This
probability is modeled dynamically and contextually, enabling fine-grained,
query specific judgments. The predicted scores are used in two downstream
components: (1) resampling, where negatives are reweighted during training, and
(2) reranking, where top-k retrieved documents are reordered at inference.
Empirical results on standard benchmarks show that our adapter-enhanced
framework consistently outperforms strong Bi-Encoder baselines, underscoring
the benefit of explicit false negative modeling in dense retrieval.

improvements of up to 22.1% in NDCG@10 over sparse baselines and up to 6.5%
over the strongest baseline. Further, BMQExpander generalizes robustly under
query perturbation settings, in contrast to supervised baselines, achieving up

Conclusion: NSP显著推动了电商中生成推荐系统的效果，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recommendation systems are essential tools in modern e-commerce, facilitating
personalized user experiences by suggesting relevant products. Recent
advancements in generative models have demonstrated potential in enhancing
recommendation systems; however, these models often exhibit limitations in
optimizing retrieval tasks, primarily due to their reliance on autoregressive
generation mechanisms. Conventional approaches introduce sequential
dependencies that impede efficient retrieval, as they are inherently unsuitable
for generating multiple items without positional constraints within a single
request session. To address these limitations, we propose TBGRecall, a
framework integrating Next Session Prediction (NSP), designed to enhance
generative retrieval models for e-commerce applications. Our framework
reformulation involves partitioning input samples into multi-session sequences,
where each sequence comprises a session token followed by a set of item tokens,
and then further incorporate multiple optimizations tailored to the generative
task in retrieval scenarios. In terms of training methodology, our pipeline
integrates limited historical data pre-training with stochastic partial
incremental training, significantly improving training efficiency and
emphasizing the superiority of data recency over sheer data volume. Our
extensive experiments, conducted on public benchmarks alongside a large-scale
industrial dataset from TaoBao, show TBGRecall outperforms the state-of-the-art
recommendation methods, and exhibits a clear scaling law trend. Ultimately, NSP
represents a significant advancement in the effectiveness of generative
recommendation systems for e-commerce applications.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of hyperbolic geometry for
capturing complex patterns from interaction data in recommender systems. In
this work, we introduce a novel hyperbolic recommendation model that uses
geometrical insights to improve representation learning and increase
computational stability at the same time. We reformulate the notion of
hyperbolic distances to unlock additional representation capacity over
conventional Euclidean space and learn more expressive user and item
representations. To better capture user-items interactions, we construct a
triplet loss that models ternary relations between users and their
corresponding preferred and nonpreferred choices through a mix of pairwise
interaction terms driven by the geometry of data. Our hyperbolic approach not
only outperforms existing Euclidean and hyperbolic models but also reduces
popularity bias, leading to more diverse and personalized recommendations.

Abstract: The centralized collection of search interaction logs for training ranking
models raises significant privacy concerns. Federated Online Learning to Rank
(FOLTR) offers a privacy-preserving alternative by enabling collaborative model
training without sharing raw user data. However, benchmarks in FOLTR are
largely based on random partitioning of classical learning-to-rank datasets,
simulated user clicks, and the assumption of synchronous client participation.
This oversimplifies real-world dynamics and undermines the realism of
experimental results. We present AOL4FOLTR, a large-scale web search dataset
with 2.6 million queries from 10,000 users. Our dataset addresses key
limitations of existing benchmarks by including user identifiers, real click
data, and query timestamps, enabling realistic user partitioning, behavior
modeling, and asynchronous federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is a core task in e-commerce search.
BERT-based models excel at semantic matching but lack complex reasoning
capabilities. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are explored, most still use
discriminative fine-tuning or distill to smaller models for deployment. We
propose a framework to directly deploy LLMs for this task, addressing key
challenges: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) error accumulation, discriminative
hallucination, and deployment feasibility. Our framework, TaoSR1, involves
three stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with CoT to instill reasoning;
(2) Offline sampling with a pass@N strategy and Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) to improve generation quality; and (3) Difficulty-based dynamic sampling
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to mitigate discriminative
hallucination. Additionally, post-CoT processing and a cumulative
probability-based partitioning method enable efficient online deployment.
TaoSR1 significantly outperforms baselines on offline datasets and achieves
substantial gains in online side-by-side human evaluations, introducing a novel
paradigm for applying CoT reasoning to relevance classification.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于多视图图数据的对比多视图图哈希（CMGHash）框架，有效融合多源异构图信息，生成判别性二值嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多视图图数据在各种领域的普及，需要一种高效、统一的编码方法以实现快速检索。

Method: 引入对比学习机制，学习一致的节点表示空间，并施加二值化约束，将连续表示转化为二值嵌入。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，CMGHash在检索准确率方面显著优于现有方法，验证其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功融合多视图异构信息，提升了多视图图数据的存储和检索效率，为相关应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view graph data, which both captures node attributes and rich
relational information from diverse sources, is becoming increasingly prevalent
in various domains. The effective and efficient retrieval of such data is an
important task. Although multi-view hashing techniques have offered a paradigm
for fusing diverse information into compact binary codes, they typically assume
attributes-based inputs per view. This makes them unsuitable for multi-view
graph data, where effectively encoding and fusing complex topological
information from multiple heterogeneous graph views to generate unified binary
embeddings remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose
Contrastive Multi-view Graph Hashing (CMGHash), a novel end-to-end framework
designed to learn unified and discriminative binary embeddings from multi-view
graph data. CMGHash learns a consensus node representation space using a
contrastive multi-view graph loss, which aims to pull $k$-nearest neighbors
from all graphs closer while pushing away negative pairs, i.e., non-neighbor
nodes. Moreover, we impose binarization constraints on this consensus space,
enabling its conversion to a corresponding binary embedding space at minimal
cost. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CMGHash significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of retrieval
accuracy.

Conclusion: DGDPO显著提升了用户模拟的真实感和多轮交互的适应性，有助于推荐系统的研究与应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled realistic user
simulators for developing and evaluating recommender systems (RSs). However,
existing LLM-based simulators for RSs face two major limitations: (1) static
and single-step prompt-based inference that leads to inaccurate and incomplete
user profile construction; (2) unrealistic and single-round
recommendation-feedback interaction pattern that fails to capture real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DGDPO (Diagnostic-Guided
Dynamic Profile Optimization), a novel framework that constructs user profile
through a dynamic and iterative optimization process to enhance the simulation
fidelity. Specifically, DGDPO incorporates two core modules within each
optimization loop: firstly, a specialized LLM-based diagnostic module,
calibrated through our novel training strategy, accurately identifies specific
defects in the user profile. Subsequently, a generalized LLM-based treatment
module analyzes the diagnosed defect and generates targeted suggestions to
refine the profile. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM-based user simulators that
are limited to single-round interactions, we are the first to integrate DGDPO
with sequential recommenders, enabling a bidirectional evolution where user
profiles and recommendation strategies adapt to each other over multi-round
interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Abstract: Accurate watch time prediction is crucial for enhancing user engagement in
streaming short-video platforms, although it is challenged by complex
distribution characteristics across multi-granularity levels. Through
systematic analysis of real-world industrial data, we uncover two critical
challenges in watch time prediction from a distribution aspect: (1)
coarse-grained skewness induced by a significant concentration of quick-skips1,
(2) fine-grained diversity arising from various user-video interaction
patterns. Consequently, we assume that the watch time follows the
Exponential-Gaussian Mixture (EGM) distribution, where the exponential and
Gaussian components respectively characterize the skewness and diversity.
Accordingly, an Exponential-Gaussian Mixture Network (EGMN) is proposed for the
parameterization of EGM distribution, which consists of two key modules: a
hidden representation encoder and a mixture parameter generator. We conducted
extensive offline experiments on public datasets and online A/B tests on the
industrial short-video feeding scenario of Xiaohongshu App to validate the
superiority of EGMN compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.
Remarkably, comprehensive experimental results have proven that EGMN exhibits
excellent distribution fitting ability across coarse-to-fine-grained levels. We

Conclusion: 非对称扩散模型在推荐系统中有效增强表示能力，改善个性化信息保持，具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Recently, motivated by the outstanding achievements of diffusion models, the
diffusion process has been employed to strengthen representation learning in
recommendation systems. Most diffusion-based recommendation models typically
utilize standard Gaussian noise in symmetric forward and reverse processes in
continuous data space. Nevertheless, the samples derived from recommendation
systems inhabit a discrete data space, which is fundamentally different from
the continuous one. Moreover, Gaussian noise has the potential to corrupt
personalized information within latent representations. In this work, we
propose a novel and effective method, named Asymmetric Diffusion Recommendation
Model (AsymDiffRec), which learns forward and reverse processes in an
asymmetric manner. We define a generalized forward process that simulates the
missing features in real-world recommendation samples. The reverse process is
then performed in an asymmetric latent feature space. To preserve personalized
information within the latent representation, a task-oriented optimization
strategy is introduced. In the serving stage, the raw sample with missing
features is regarded as a noisy input to generate a denoising and robust
representation for the final prediction. By equipping base models with
AsymDiffRec, we conduct online A/B tests, achieving improvements of +0.131% and
+0.166% in terms of users' active days and app usage duration respectively.
Additionally, the extended offline experiments also demonstrate improvements.
AsymDiffRec has been implemented in the Douyin Music App.

Abstract: Norm-aware recommender systems have gained increased attention, especially
for diversity optimization. The recommender systems community has
well-established experimentation pipelines that support reproducible
evaluations by facilitating models' benchmarking and comparisons against
state-of-the-art methods. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is
currently no reproducibility framework to support thorough norm-driven
experimentation at the pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing, and
evaluation stages of the recommender pipeline. To address this gap, we present
Informfully Recommenders, a first step towards a normative reproducibility
framework that focuses on diversity-aware design built on Cornac. Our extension
provides an end-to-end solution for implementing and experimenting with
normative and general-purpose diverse recommender systems that cover 1) dataset
pre-processing, 2) diversity-optimized models, 3) dedicated intrasession item
re-ranking, and 4) an extensive set of diversity metrics. We demonstrate the
capabilities of our extension through an extensive offline experiment in the
news domain.

Abstract: Personalized news recommendation aims to deliver news articles aligned with
users' interests, serving as a key solution to alleviate the problem of
information overload on online news platforms. While prior work has improved
interest matching through refined representations of news and users, the
following time-related challenges remain underexplored: (C1) leveraging the age
of clicked news to infer users' interest persistence, and (C2) modeling the
varying lifetime of news across topics and users. To jointly address these
challenges, we propose a novel Lifetime-aware Interest Matching framework for
nEws recommendation, named LIME, which incorporates three key strategies: (1)
User-Topic lifetime-aware age representation to capture the relative age of
news with respect to a user-topic pair, (2) Candidate-aware lifetime attention
for generating temporally aligned user representation, and (3) Freshness-guided
interest refinement for prioritizing valid candidate news at prediction time.
Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that LIME
consistently outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art news recommendation
methods, and its model agnostic strategies significantly improve recommendation
accuracy.

Conclusion: EvoCut实现了加速切割的自动生成和优化，有助于提升整数规划求解效率与效果，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Integer programming lies at the heart of crucial combinatorial optimization
tasks but remains challenging due to its NP-hard nature. An effective approach
for practically solving integer programs is the manual design of acceleration
cuts, i.e. inequalities that improve solver performance. However, this creative
process demands deep expertise and is yet to be automated. Our proposed
framework, EvoCut, automates the generation of acceleration cuts by combining
large language models (LLMs) with an evolutionary search. EvoCut (i)
initializes a diverse population of candidate cuts via an LLM-based initializer
agent; (ii) for each cut empirically evaluates both preservation of the optimal
solution and its ability to cut off fractional solutions across a verification
set; and (iii) iteratively refines the population through evolutionary
crossover and mutation agents. We quantify each cut's utility by its relative
reduction in the solver's optimality gap. Our comparisons against standard
integer programming practice show that EvoCut reduces optimality gap by 17-57%
within a fixed time. It obtains the same solutions up to 4 times as fast, and
obtains higher-quality solutions within the same time limit. Requiring no human
expert input, EvoCut reliably generates, improves, and empirically verifies
cuts that generalize to unseen instances. The code is available at

Constrained retrosynthesis planning is an essential, yet challenging, process
within chemistry for identifying synthetic routes from commercially available
starting materials to desired target molecules, subject to practical
constraints. Here, we present LARC, the first LLM-based Agentic framework for
Retrosynthesis planning under Constraints. LARC incorporates agentic constraint
evaluation, through an Agent-as-a-Judge, directly into the retrosynthesis
planning process, using agentic feedback grounded in tool-based reasoning to
guide and constrain route generation. We rigorously evaluate LARC on a
carefully curated set of 48 constrained retrosynthesis planning tasks across 3
constraint types. LARC achieves a 72.9% success rate on these tasks, vastly
outperforming LLM baselines and approaching human expert-level success in

Result: LLMs表现出一致的战略推理水平，框架具备鲁棒性和泛化能力。Chat机制影响负面，Memory机制提升推理能力。

Conclusion: CHBench作为评估工具潜力巨大，有助于推动LLMs战略推理研究与实践。

Abstract: Game-playing ability serves as an indicator for evaluating the strategic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). While most existing
studies rely on utility performance metrics, which are not robust enough due to
variations in opponent behavior and game structure. To address this limitation,
we propose \textbf{Cognitive Hierarchy Benchmark (CHBench)}, a novel evaluation
framework inspired by the cognitive hierarchy models from behavioral economics.
We hypothesize that agents have bounded rationality -- different agents behave
at varying reasoning depths/levels. We evaluate LLMs' strategic reasoning
through a three-phase systematic framework, utilizing behavioral data from six
state-of-the-art LLMs across fifteen carefully selected normal-form games.
Experiments show that LLMs exhibit consistent strategic reasoning levels across
diverse opponents, confirming the framework's robustness and generalization
capability. We also analyze the effects of two key mechanisms (Chat Mechanism
and Memory Mechanism) on strategic reasoning performance. Results indicate that
the Chat Mechanism significantly degrades strategic reasoning, whereas the
Memory Mechanism enhances it. These insights position CHBench as a promising
tool for evaluating LLM capabilities, with significant potential for future
research and practical applications.

Abstract: Optimizing data mixtures for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language
models (LLMs) is critical for developing general-purpose models, yet this area
remains underexplored. In this paper, we frame data mixing as an optimization
problem and introduce a novel method designed to minimize validation loss. Our
approach parametrizes the loss by modeling effective data transferred and
leveraging scaling laws for fine-tuning. By experimenting with various
small-scale data mixtures, we fit these parameters and derive the optimal
weights. We provide both mathematical proofs and empirical results
demonstrating that our algorithm achieves excellent overall and individual
performance across all domains. Through controlled experiments, we show that
models trained with our optimized weights perform on par with those using
optimal weights determined via grid search, with per-domain loss only 0.66%
higher than the best domain loss from grid search on average. Additionally, we
show that reweighting popular SFT datasets using our method improves both
validation loss and downstream performance. Finally, we discuss how our method
can generalize to guide data selection for domain-specific models and provide
insights into SFT.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a foundational task across domains, such as
finance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. While recent advances in
Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated strong generalisation
through large-scale pretraining, existing models operate predominantly in a
unimodal setting, ignoring the rich multimodal context, such as visual and
textual signals, that often accompanies time series data in real-world
scenarios. This paper introduces a novel parameter-efficient multimodal
framework, UniCast, that extends TSFMs to jointly leverage time series, vision,
and text modalities for enhanced forecasting performance. Our method integrates
modality-specific embeddings from pretrained Vision and Text Encoders with a
frozen TSFM via soft prompt tuning, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal
parameter updates. This design not only preserves the generalisation strength
of the foundation model but also enables effective cross-modal interaction.
Extensive experiments across diverse time-series forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that UniCast consistently and significantly outperforms all
existing TSFM baselines. The findings highlight the critical role of multimodal
context in advancing the next generation of general-purpose time series
forecasters.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods based on game theory are ubiquitous in the field
of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Recent works proposed rigorous
feature attribution using logic-based explanations, specifically targeting
high-stakes uses of machine learning (ML) models. Typically, such works exploit
weak abductive explanation (WAXp) as the characteristic function to assign
importance to features. However, one possible downside is that the contribution
of non-WAXp sets is neglected. In fact, non-WAXp sets can also convey important
information, because of the relationship between formal explanations (XPs) and
adversarial examples (AExs). Accordingly, this paper leverages Shapley value
and Banzhaf index to devise two novel feature importance scores. We take into
account non-WAXp sets when computing feature contribution, and the novel scores
quantify how effective each feature is at excluding AExs. Furthermore, the
paper identifies properties and studies the computational complexity of the
proposed scores.

Motivation: 解决VLMs在图表理解任务中准确描述与复杂推理能力不足的问题，尤其是在合成数据存在噪声标签的挑战下。

Method: 通过代码生成和执行构建对齐的图表-问题-答案三元组，确保合成数据的可靠性，并设计候选答案融合策略以提升推理性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效改善VLM的图表理解能力，为未来图表数据自动生成与模型自我提升提供了新的途径。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with chart understanding tasks,
particularly in accurate chart description and complex reasoning. Synthetic
data generation is a promising solution, while usually facing the challenge of
noise labels. To address this challenge, we first introduce a chart synthesis
pipeline that generates aligned chart-question-answer triplets through code
generation and execution, ensuring the reliability of synthetic data without
human intervention. Furthermore, inspired by test-time scaling that increases
inference budget and thereby improves performance, we design a
candidate-conditioned answering process. The VLM first generates multiple
responses per query, and then synthesizes the final answer by contextualizing
these candidates. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with up to
15.50 points accuracy gain over the initial VLM, in a fully self-improving
paradigm without either human-labeled data or external models.

Motivation: 弥补缺乏针对未来预测的全面评估基准的空白，推动LLM在复杂预测任务中的发展。

Method: 设计了支持实时更新、自动化问题与答案收集的FutureX基准，评估25个模型，分析其失败模式和性能瓶颈。

Result: FutureX成为最大且多样化的未来预测评估工具，揭示不同模型在动态环境中的优势与不足。

Conclusion: 未来X推动了专业水平的未来预测能力评估，为提升LLM在复杂预测任务中的应用奠定基础。

Abstract: Future prediction is a complex task for LLM agents, requiring a high level of
analytical thinking, information gathering, contextual understanding, and
decision-making under uncertainty. Agents must not only gather and interpret
vast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources,
weigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as
human experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its
importance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future
prediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and
retrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce
$\textbf{FutureX}$, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically
designed for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the
largest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting
real-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated
pipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent
models, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of
external tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source
Deep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive
reasoning and performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we provide
in-depth analyses of agents' failure modes and performance pitfalls in
future-oriented tasks, including the vulnerability to fake web pages and the
temporal validity. Our goal is to establish a dynamic, contamination-free
evaluation standard that drives the development of LLM agents capable of
performing at the level of professional human analysts in complex reasoning and
predictive thinking.

Motivation: 随着AIGs在芯片设计中的广泛应用，复杂结构导致准确建模的挑战，特别是在同时捕捉功能和结构特性方面的不足。

Method: 提出AIGer模型，包括节点逻辑特征初始化嵌入和异构图卷积网络，用于动态关系建模和信息汇聚。

Result: AIGer在信号概率预测和真值表距离预测任务中，显著优于现有模型，MAE和MSE指标提升明显。

Conclusion: AIGer有效增强了AIGs的功能与结构联合建模能力，提升了电子设计自动化中的预测效果。

Abstract: The automation of logic circuit design enhances chip performance, energy
efficiency, and reliability, and is widely applied in the field of Electronic
Design Automation (EDA).And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs) efficiently represent,
optimize, and verify the functional characteristics of digital circuits,
enhancing the efficiency of EDA development.Due to the complex structure and
large scale of nodes in real-world AIGs, accurate modeling is challenging,
leading to existing work lacking the ability to jointly model functional and
structural characteristics, as well as insufficient dynamic information
propagation capability.To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose
AIGer.Specifically, AIGer consists of two components: 1) Node logic feature
initialization embedding component and 2) AIGs feature learning network
component.The node logic feature initialization embedding component projects
logic nodes, such as AND and NOT, into independent semantic spaces, to enable
effective node embedding for subsequent processing.Building upon this, the AIGs
feature learning network component employs a heterogeneous graph convolutional
network, designing dynamic relationship weight matrices and differentiated
information aggregation approaches to better represent the original structure
and information of AIGs.The combination of these two components enhances
AIGer's ability to jointly model functional and structural characteristics and
improves its message passing capability. Experimental results indicate that
AIGer outperforms the current best models in the Signal Probability Prediction
(SSP) task, improving MAE and MSE by 18.95\% and 44.44\%, respectively. In the
Truth Table Distance Prediction (TTDP) task, AIGer achieves improvements of
33.57\% and 14.79\% in MAE and MSE, respectively, compared to the
best-performing models.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了最优性能，显示出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: AgentCDM有效改善多智能体系统中的合作决策质量与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) hold
significant promise for solving complex decision-making tasks. However, the
core process of collaborative decision-making (CDM) within these systems
remains underexplored. Existing approaches often rely on either ``dictatorial"
strategies that are vulnerable to the cognitive biases of a single agent, or
``voting-based" methods that fail to fully harness collective intelligence. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{AgentCDM}, a structured framework
for enhancing collaborative decision-making in LLM-based multi-agent systems.
Drawing inspiration from the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) in
cognitive science, AgentCDM introduces a structured reasoning paradigm that
systematically mitigates cognitive biases and shifts decision-making from
passive answer selection to active hypothesis evaluation and construction. To
internalize this reasoning process, we develop a two-stage training paradigm:
the first stage uses explicit ACH-inspired scaffolding to guide the model
through structured reasoning, while the second stage progressively removes this
scaffolding to encourage autonomous generalization. Experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that AgentCDM achieves state-of-the-art
performance and exhibits strong generalization, validating its effectiveness in
improving the quality and robustness of collaborative decisions in MAS.

Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder is one of the leading causes of disability
worldwide, yet its diagnosis still depends largely on subjective clinical
assessments. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise for
developing objective, scalable, and timely diagnostic tools. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art AI methods for depression
detection and diagnosis, based on a systematic review of 55 key studies. We
introduce a novel hierarchical taxonomy that structures the field by primary
clinical task (diagnosis vs. prediction), data modality (text, speech,
neuroimaging, multimodal), and computational model class (e.g., graph neural
networks, large language models, hybrid approaches). Our in-depth analysis
reveals three major trends: the predominance of graph neural networks for
modeling brain connectivity, the rise of large language models for linguistic
and conversational data, and an emerging focus on multimodal fusion,
explainability, and algorithmic fairness. Alongside methodological insights, we
provide an overview of prominent public datasets and standard evaluation
metrics as a practical guide for researchers. By synthesizing current advances
and highlighting open challenges, this survey offers a comprehensive roadmap
for future innovation in computational psychiatry.

Motivation: 提升对抽象视觉推理（AVR）模型在复杂现实场景中的能力评估，弥补现有数据集规模和复杂度的不足。

Method: 通过使用视觉-语言模型（VLM）流水线生成大量真实感图像及描述，构建了包含5,400个实例的新数据集，并评估了前沿VLM模型在多种任务中的表现。

Result: VLM模型在识别粗略概念方面表现良好，但在辨别细粒度概念时存在明显困难，显示出其推理能力的局限性。

Conclusion: 新数据集拓展了抽象视觉推理的评估范围，突显了当前模型在处理复杂细节方面的不足，为未来提升模型细粒度推理能力提供了方向。

Abstract: Bongard Problems (BPs) provide a challenging testbed for abstract visual
reasoning (AVR), requiring models to identify visual concepts fromjust a few
examples and describe them in natural language. Early BP benchmarks featured
synthetic black-and-white drawings, which might not fully capture the
complexity of real-world scenes. Subsequent BP datasets employed real-world
images, albeit the represented concepts are identifiable from high-level image
features, reducing the task complexity. Differently, the recently released
Bongard-RWR dataset aimed at representing abstract concepts formulated in the
original BPs using fine-grained real-world images. Its manual construction,
however, limited the dataset size to just $60$ instances, constraining
evaluation robustness. In this work, we introduce Bongard-RWR+, a BP dataset
composed of $5\,400$ instances that represent original BP abstract concepts
using real-world-like images generated via a vision language model (VLM)
pipeline. Building on Bongard-RWR, we employ Pixtral-12B to describe manually
curated images and generate new descriptions aligned with the underlying
concepts, use Flux.1-dev to synthesize images from these descriptions, and
manually verify that the generated images faithfully reflect the intended
concepts. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs across diverse BP formulations,
including binary and multiclass classification, as well as textual answer
generation. Our findings reveal that while VLMs can recognize coarse-grained
visual concepts, they consistently struggle with discerning fine-grained
concepts, highlighting limitations in their reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 研究不同类型主动推理代理在导航任务中的表现差异，特别是对行动感知的依赖性。

Method: 通过在两种导航任务中对行动感知型和非感知型代理进行性能比较。

Result: 非感知型代理虽然在某些方面表现不如行动感知型，但能够达到接近的性能，显示其在信息利用上的潜力。

Conclusion: 行动信息的利用提升了代理的导航性能，但在某些条件下，缺乏行动知晓的代理仍具有较强的适应能力。

Abstract: Active inference is a formal approach to study cognition based on the notion
that adaptive agents can be seen as engaging in a process of approximate
Bayesian inference, via the minimisation of variational and expected free
energies. Minimising the former provides an account of perceptual processes and
learning as evidence accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how
agents select their actions over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to
maximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative
model of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have
been proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they
all share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an
appropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their
desirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past
motor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents
are assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan
for the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and
must infer their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for
the future. This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two
leading frameworks in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an
efference copy signal representing knowledge about an agent's own actions. In
this work we compare the performances of action-aware and action-unaware agents
in two navigations tasks, showing how action-unaware agents can achieve
performances comparable to action-aware ones while at a severe disadvantage.

Conclusion: MAPF-World通过场景理解和前瞻性决策提升多智能体路径规划效果，为复杂多智能体任务提供更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning conflict-free
paths from the designated start locations to goal positions for multiple
agents. It underlies a variety of real-world tasks, including multi-robot
coordination, robot-assisted logistics, and social navigation. Recent
decentralized learnable solvers have shown great promise for large-scale MAPF,
especially when leveraging foundation models and large datasets. However, these
agents are reactive policy models and exhibit limited modeling of environmental
temporal dynamics and inter-agent dependencies, resulting in performance
degradation in complex, long-term planning scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose MAPF-World, an autoregressive action world model for
MAPF that unifies situation understanding and action generation, guiding
decisions beyond immediate local observations. It improves situational
awareness by explicitly modeling environmental dynamics, including spatial
features and temporal dependencies, through future state and actions
prediction. By incorporating these predicted futures, MAPF-World enables more
informed, coordinated, and far-sighted decision-making, especially in complex
multi-agent settings. Furthermore, we augment MAPF benchmarks by introducing an
automatic map generator grounded in real-world scenarios, capturing practical
map layouts for training and evaluating MAPF solvers. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MAPF-World outperforms state-of-the-art learnable solvers,
showcasing superior zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution cases.
Notably, MAPF-World is trained with a 96.5% smaller model size and 92% reduced
data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理模型缺乏明确的语义层次结构、用户与领域知识的对齐以及有效的推理线程剪枝机制，导致输出冗长且未能有效引导用户。

Method: 利用图神经网络从稀疏领域知识图中提取语义相关结构，并结合大型语言模型解决知识差异；然后通过奖励引导策略对推理线程进行评估和剪枝。

Result: 实验和专家评估表明，该框架提升了用户理解效果，并优于现有的推理模型。

Conclusion: 通过结构化知识重用和奖励驱动的筛选机制，ReT-Eval显著改善了交互式推理的有效性和用户体验。

Abstract: Reasoning in interactive problem solving scenarios requires models to
construct reasoning threads that reflect user understanding and align with
structured domain knowledge. However, current reasoning models often lack
explicit semantic hierarchies, user-domain knowledge alignment, and principled
mechanisms to prune reasoning threads for effectiveness. These limitations
result in lengthy generic output that does not guide users through
goal-oriented reasoning steps. To address this, we propose a
prototype-inspired, two-phases Reasoning-Threads-Evaluation (ReT-Eval)
framework, drawing inspiration from human-like reasoning strategies that
emphasize structured knowledge reuse. In the first phase, semantically relevant
knowledge structures are extracted from a sparse domain knowledge graph using a
graph neural network and enriched with intrinsic large language model knowledge
to resolve knowledge discrepancies. In the second phase, these threads are
evaluated and pruned using a reward-guided strategy aimed at maintaining
semantic coherence to generate effective reasoning threads. Experiments and
expert evaluations show that ReT-Eval enhances user understanding and
outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models.

Result: 在文本-视频-音频检索任务中，优于现有最优方法，增强泛化和结构一致性。

Conclusion: MOVER有效提升多模态表示的语义对齐与结构化，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal learning have largely relied on pairwise
contrastive objectives to align different modalities, such as text, video, and
audio, in a shared embedding space. While effective in bi-modal setups, these
approaches struggle to generalize across multiple modalities and often lack
semantic structure in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we propose MOVER,
a novel framework that combines optimal transport-based soft alignment with
volume-based geometric regularization to build semantically aligned and
structured multimodal representations. By integrating a transport-guided
matching mechanism with a geometric volume minimization objective (GAVE), MOVER
encourages consistent alignment across all modalities in a modality-agnostic
manner. Experiments on text-video-audio retrieval tasks demonstrate that MOVER
significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot and
finetuned settings. Additional analysis shows improved generalization to unseen
modality combinations and stronger structural consistency in the learned
embedding space.

Conclusion: RLNVR结合GSPO和UED为无验证噪声奖励的语言模型训练提供了有效途径，具有应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces RLNVR (Reinforcement Learning from Non-Verified
Rewards), a framework for training language models using noisy, real-world
feedback signals without requiring explicit human verification. Traditional
RLHF requires expensive, verified reward signals that are impractical in many
real-world domains. RLNVR addresses this challenge through baseline
normalization and semantic similarity-based reward transfer. We demonstrate
RLNVR through Walter, a prototype system that optimizes social media content
generation using actual engagement data from Bluesky. Our experimental results
show significant improvements in content quality and training stability, with
comprehensive evaluation planned for future work. Positioning: We present a
practical framework that combines RLNVR with GSPO (Group Sequence Policy
Optimization) and an optional UED (Unsupervised Environment Design) curriculum
to improve stability and diversity under noisy, implicit rewards. To our
knowledge, combining GSPO-style normalization with a UED-style curriculum for
LLM content generation from implicit social engagement has not been previously
documented in this applied setting; we frame this as an applied integration
rather than a new algorithm.

Conclusion: Mantis作为通用、可解释、可部署的预测工具，有望推动下一代疾病预警系统的发展。

Abstract: Infectious disease forecasting in novel outbreaks or low resource settings
has been limited by the need for disease-specific data, bespoke training, and
expert tuning. We introduce Mantis, a foundation model trained entirely on
mechanistic simulations, which enables out-of-the-box forecasting across
diseases, regions, and outcomes, even in settings with limited historical data.
Mantis is built on over 400 million simulated days of outbreak dynamics
spanning diverse pathogens, transmission modes, interventions, and surveillance
artifacts. Despite requiring no real-world data during training, Mantis
outperformed 39 expert-tuned models we tested across six diseases, including
all models in the CDC's COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Mantis generalized to novel
epidemiological regimes, including diseases with held-out transmission
mechanisms, demonstrating that it captures fundamental contagion dynamics.
Critically, Mantis is mechanistically interpretable, enabling public health
decision-makers to identify the latent drivers behind its predictions. Finally,
Mantis delivers accurate forecasts at 8-week horizons, more than doubling the
actionable range of most models, enabling proactive public health planning.
Together, these capabilities position Mantis as a foundation for
next-generation disease forecasting systems: general, interpretable, and
deployable where traditional models fail.

Abstract: Quality analysis of weather forecasts is an essential topic in meteorology.
Although traditional score-based evaluation metrics can quantify certain
forecast errors, they are still far from meteorological experts in terms of
descriptive capability, interpretability, and understanding of dynamic
evolution. With the rapid development of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), these models become potential tools to overcome the above challenges.
In this work, we introduce an MLLM-based weather forecast analysis method,
RadarQA, integrating key physical attributes with detailed assessment reports.
We introduce a novel and comprehensive task paradigm for multi-modal quality
analysis, encompassing both single frame and sequence, under both rating and
assessment scenarios. To support training and benchmarking, we design a hybrid
annotation pipeline that combines human expert labeling with automated
heuristics. With such an annotation method, we construct RQA-70K, a large-scale
dataset with varying difficulty levels for radar forecast quality evaluation.
We further design a multi-stage training strategy that iteratively improves
model performance at each stage. Extensive experiments show that RadarQA
outperforms existing general MLLMs across all evaluation settings, highlighting
its potential for advancing quality analysis in weather prediction.

Conclusion: RLCCF通过多模型协作，有效突破单模型局限，显著增强大模型的推理表现，推动模型集体能力的发展。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly enhanced the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but its reliance on expensive
human-labeled data or complex reward models severely limits scalability. While
existing self-feedback methods aim to address this problem, they are
constrained by the capabilities of a single model, which can lead to
overconfidence in incorrect answers, reward hacking, and even training
collapse. To this end, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Coevolutionary
Collective Feedback (RLCCF), a novel RL framework that enables multi-model
collaborative evolution without external supervision. Specifically, RLCCF
optimizes the ability of a model collective by maximizing its Collective
Consistency (CC), which jointly trains a diverse ensemble of LLMs and provides
reward signals by voting on collective outputs. Moreover, each model's vote is
weighted by its Self-Consistency (SC) score, ensuring that more confident
models contribute more to the collective decision. Benefiting from the diverse
output distributions and complementary abilities of multiple LLMs, RLCCF
enables the model collective to continuously enhance its reasoning ability
through coevolution. Experiments on four mainstream open-source LLMs across
four mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our framework yields
significant performance gains, achieving an average relative improvement of
16.72\% in accuracy. Notably, RLCCF not only improves the performance of
individual models but also enhances the group's majority-voting accuracy by
4.51\%, demonstrating its ability to extend the collective capability boundary

Abstract: Fault intensity diagnosis (FID) plays a pivotal role in monitoring and
maintaining mechanical devices within complex industrial systems. As current
FID methods are based on chain of thought without considering dependencies
among target classes. To capture and explore dependencies, we propose a
hierarchical knowledge guided fault intensity diagnosis framework (HKG)
inspired by the tree of thought, which is amenable to any representation
learning methods. The HKG uses graph convolutional networks to map the
hierarchical topological graph of class representations into a set of
interdependent global hierarchical classifiers, where each node is denoted by
word embeddings of a class. These global hierarchical classifiers are applied
to learned deep features extracted by representation learning, allowing the
entire model to be end-to-end learnable. In addition, we develop a re-weighted
hierarchical knowledge correlation matrix (Re-HKCM) scheme by embedding
inter-class hierarchical knowledge into a data-driven statistical correlation
matrix (SCM) which effectively guides the information sharing of nodes in
graphical convolutional neural networks and avoids over-smoothing issues. The
Re-HKCM is derived from the SCM through a series of mathematical
transformations. Extensive experiments are performed on four real-world
datasets from different industrial domains (three cavitation datasets from
SAMSON AG and one existing publicly) for FID, all showing superior results and
outperform recent state-of-the-art FID methods.

TL;DR: 提出GraphCogent框架改善大规模图推理，结合人类工作记忆模型，通过模块化处理复杂图任务，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理复杂实际图任务时表现不足，需求提升推理能力。

Method: 设计结合感知、缓冲和执行的合作代理架构，配合新基准测试Graph4real评估。

Result: GraphCogent显著优于传统模型和基线，提升50%的准确率，减少80%的代币使用。

Conclusion: 通过模块化和仿人类认知模型，有效增强LLMs的图推理能力，推动实际应用发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promising performance on small-scale graph
reasoning tasks but fail when handling real-world graphs with complex queries.
This phenomenon stems from LLMs' inability to effectively process complex graph
topology and perform multi-step reasoning simultaneously. To address these
limitations, we propose GraphCogent, a collaborative agent framework inspired
by human Working Memory Model that decomposes graph reasoning into specialized
cognitive processes: sense, buffer, and execute. The framework consists of
three modules: Sensory Module standardizes diverse graph text representations
via subgraph sampling, Buffer Module integrates and indexes graph data across
multiple formats, and Execution Module combines tool calling and model
generation for efficient reasoning. We also introduce Graph4real, a
comprehensive benchmark contains with four domains of real-world graphs (Web,
Social, Transportation, and Citation) to evaluate LLMs' graph reasoning
capabilities. Our Graph4real covers 21 different graph reasoning tasks,
categorized into three types (Structural Querying, Algorithmic Reasoning, and
Predictive Modeling tasks), with graph scales that are 10 times larger than
existing benchmarks. Experiments show that Llama3.1-8B based GraphCogent
achieves a 50% improvement over massive-scale LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 (671B).
Compared to state-of-the-art agent-based baseline, our framework outperforms by
20% in accuracy while reducing token usage by 80% for in-toolset tasks and 30%
for out-toolset tasks. Code will be available after review.

Result: 在多个逻辑推理基准测试中表现优异，特别是在复杂推理任务上显著优于传统链式思维。

Conclusion: 符号辅助的链式思维有效增强了大型语言模型的逻辑推理能力和理解透明度，适用于多种推理场景。

Abstract: This work introduces Symbolic-Aided Chain-of-Thought (CoT), an improved
approach to standard CoT, for logical reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). The key idea is to integrate lightweight symbolic representations into
few-shot prompts, structuring the inference steps with a consistent strategy to
make reasoning patterns more explicit within a non-iterative reasoning process.
By incorporating these symbolic structures, our method preserves the
generalizability of standard prompting techniques while enhancing the
transparency, interpretability, and analyzability of LLM logical reasoning.
Extensive experiments on four well-known logical reasoning benchmarks --
ProofWriter, FOLIO, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction, which cover diverse
reasoning scenarios -- demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
particularly in complex reasoning tasks that require navigating multiple
constraints or rules. Notably, Symbolic-Aided CoT consistently improves LLMs'
reasoning capabilities across various model sizes and significantly outperforms
conventional CoT on three out of four datasets, ProofWriter, ProntoQA, and
LogicalDeduction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微服务系统中的根因分析困难，现有方法单一模态或缺乏行动性指导。

Method: 提出多模态框架GALA，结合统计因果推断与LLM迭代推理。

Result: 在开源基准上，GALA提升准确率达42.22%，生成更具因果性和行动性的诊断结果。

Conclusion: GALA有效缩小自动故障诊断与实用事件解决之间的差距，提供高效、可解释的根因分析与修复指导。

Abstract: Root cause analysis (RCA) in microservice systems is challenging, requiring
on-call engineers to rapidly diagnose failures across heterogeneous telemetry
such as metrics, logs, and traces. Traditional RCA methods often focus on
single modalities or merely rank suspect services, falling short of providing
actionable diagnostic insights with remediation guidance. This paper introduces
GALA, a novel multi-modal framework that combines statistical causal inference
with LLM-driven iterative reasoning for enhanced RCA. Evaluated on an
open-source benchmark, GALA achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art methods of up to 42.22% accuracy. Our novel human-guided LLM
evaluation score shows GALA generates significantly more causally sound and
actionable diagnostic outputs than existing methods. Through comprehensive
experiments and a case study, we show that GALA bridges the gap between
automated failure diagnosis and practical incident resolution by providing both
accurate root cause identification and human-interpretable remediation
guidance.

TL;DR: 提出Yokai Learning Environment（YLE），一种基于合作卡牌游戏的多智能体强化学习环境，用于研究合作AI中的心理理论（ToM）能力及其在信念推理、记忆、伙伴泛化和更高阶ToM中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的ToM基准测试受限于被动观察者或缺乏建立和维持共同基础的能力评估，亟需更具挑战性的环境以推动合作AI的发展。

Method: 设计基于卡牌游戏Yokai的多智能体强学习环境，评估智能体在信念追踪、记忆和沟通等方面的能力。

Result: 现有强化学习智能体在YLE中表现不足，即使拥有完美记忆也难以解决问题；信念建模虽有所帮助，但在泛化与长时间游戏中的信念准确性仍有待提升，显示出对脆弱规范的依赖。

Conclusion: YLE为研究信念模型、记忆、伙伴泛化和更高阶ToM提供了新的平台，揭示当前智能体在合作中的局限性和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Developing collaborative AI hinges on Theory of Mind (ToM) - the ability to
reason about the beliefs of others to build and maintain common ground.
Existing ToM benchmarks, however, are restricted to passive observer settings
or lack an assessment of how agents establish and maintain common ground over
time. To address these gaps, we introduce the Yokai Learning Environment (YLE)
- a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) environment based on the
cooperative card game Yokai. In the YLE, agents take turns peeking at hidden
cards and moving them to form clusters based on colour. Success requires
tracking evolving beliefs, remembering past observations, using hints as
grounded communication, and maintaining common ground with teammates. Our
evaluation yields two key findings: First, current RL agents struggle to solve
the YLE, even when given access to perfect memory. Second, while belief
modelling improves performance, agents are still unable to effectively
generalise to unseen partners or form accurate beliefs over longer games,
exposing a reliance on brittle conventions rather than robust belief tracking.
We use the YLE to investigate research questions in belief modelling, memory,
partner generalisation, and scaling to higher-order ToM.

Motivation: 为了改进麻醉药物控制的精度和个体化，开发能够适应不同病人特性的智能控制系统。

Method: 设计了分数阶模糊PID控制器，利用鲸鱼优化算法优化其参数，包括分数阶参数和模糊隶属函数。

Result: 在多种患者模型上，所提出的FOFPID控制器比传统的FOPID控制器表现出更快的响应时间和更低的稳态误差。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效的自动化麻醉管理方案，具有良好的实用性和扩展性，能够提升临床中的个性化治疗水平。

Abstract: This study introduces a Fractional Order Fuzzy PID (FOFPID) controller that
uses the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to manage the Bispectral Index
(BIS), keeping it within the ideal range of forty to sixty. The FOFPID
controller combines fuzzy logic for adapting to changes and fractional order
dynamics for fine tuning. This allows it to adjust its control gains to handle
a person's unique physiology. The WOA helps fine tune the controller's
parameters, including the fractional orders and the fuzzy membership functions,
which boosts its performance. Tested on models of eight different patient
profiles, the FOFPID controller performed better than a standard Fractional
Order PID (FOPID) controller. It achieved faster settling times, at two and a
half minutes versus three point two minutes, and had a lower steady state
error, at zero point five versus one point two. These outcomes show the
FOFPID's excellent strength and accuracy. It offers a scalable, artificial
intelligence driven solution for automated anesthesia delivery that could
enhance clinical practice and improve patient results.

Result: 模型在分子轨迹数据上验证，能提前预测系统变化和识别驱动变量，提升因果理解和分析效率。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了新视角，有助于推动分子动力学系统的因果分析与自动识别关键事件。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) face challenges, including
resource-heavy computations and the need to manually scan outputs to detect
"interesting events," such as the formation and persistence of hydrogen bonds
between atoms of different molecules. A critical research gap lies in
identifying the underlying causes of hydrogen bond formation and separation
-understanding which interactions or prior events contribute to their emergence
over time. With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal
data analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these
phenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims
to identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation
events. Specifically, we treat the separation of hydrogen bonds as an
"intervention" occurring and represent the causal structure of the bonding and
separation events in the MDS as graphical causal models. These causal models
are built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us
to infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal
graphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step
to infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal
models. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional
distributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation,
this framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular
dynamic systems. We validate the efficacy of our model empirically on the
atomic trajectories that used MDS for chiral separation, demonstrating that we
can predict many steps in the future and also find the variables driving the
observed changes in the system.

Motivation: 随着MCP在增强LLMs能力上的潜力逐渐显现，系统理解其实际应用效果成为研究重点，但现有理解仍有限。

Method: 设计了包括160个提示和25个任务的数据集，进行大规模评估，涵盖六个商业LLMs和30个MCP工具套件，分析其主动性、遵从性、效果与开销。

Result: 评估发现现有MCP应用存在显著限制，挑战了其在提升性能上的假设，揭示了应用中需要改进的关键方面。

Conclusion: MCPGAUGE为评估和改进MCP在LLMs中的应用提供了基础，推动更受控、更高效的工具增强型LLMs的发展。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables large language models (LLMs) to
access external resources on demand. While commonly assumed to enhance
performance, how LLMs actually leverage this capability remains poorly
understood. We introduce MCPGAUGE, the first comprehensive evaluation framework
for probing LLM-MCP interactions along four key dimensions: proactivity
(self-initiated tool use), compliance (adherence to tool-use instructions),
effectiveness (task performance post-integration), and overhead (computational
cost incurred). MCPGAUGE comprises a 160-prompt suite and 25 datasets spanning
knowledge comprehension, general reasoning, and code generation. Our
large-scale evaluation, spanning six commercial LLMs, 30 MCP tool suites, and
both one- and two-turn interaction settings, comprises around 20,000 API calls
and over USD 6,000 in computational cost. This comprehensive study reveals four
key findings that challenge prevailing assumptions about the effectiveness of
MCP integration. These insights highlight critical limitations in current
AI-tool integration and position MCPGAUGE as a principled benchmark for
advancing controllable, tool-augmented LLMs.

Method: 采用大语言模型进行自然语言理解，结合ASP实现知识表示与推理，通过无标注文本实现无需修改核心程序即可融入新领域的JERE。

Result: 在有限训练数据下，该方法在多个基准测试中优于现有最先进系统，特别是在SciERC数据集实现显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 利用LLMs和ASP结合的方法具有强泛化能力和领域适应性，显著改善实体关系抽取效果。

Abstract: Joint entity-relation extraction (JERE) identifies both entities and their
relationships simultaneously. Traditional machine-learning based approaches to
performing this task require a large corpus of annotated data and lack the
ability to easily incorporate domain specific information in the construction
of the model. Therefore, creating a model for JERE is often labor intensive,
time consuming, and elaboration intolerant. In this paper, we propose
harnessing the capabilities of generative pretrained large language models
(LLMs) and the knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities of Answer
Set Programming (ASP) to perform JERE. We present a generic workflow for JERE
using LLMs and ASP. The workflow is generic in the sense that it can be applied
for JERE in any domain. It takes advantage of LLM's capability in natural
language understanding in that it works directly with unannotated text. It
exploits the elaboration tolerant feature of ASP in that no modification of its
core program is required when additional domain specific knowledge, in the form
of type specifications, is found and needs to be used. We demonstrate the
usefulness of the proposed workflow through experiments with limited training
data on three well-known benchmarks for JERE. The results of our experiments
show that the LLM + ASP workflow is better than state-of-the-art JERE systems
in several categories with only 10\% of training data. It is able to achieve a
2.5 times (35\% over 15\%) improvement in the Relation Extraction task for the
SciERC corpus, one of the most difficult benchmarks.

Result: 在多个教育数据集上，显著提升了知识追踪和认知诊断任务的性能，并加强了解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法为认知结构建模提供了有效途径，有助于改进个性化教育与学生模型。

Abstract: Cognitive structure is a student's subjective organization of an objective
knowledge system, reflected in the psychological construction of concepts and
their relations. However, cognitive structure assessment remains a
long-standing challenge in student modeling and psychometrics, persisting as a
foundational yet largely unassessable concept in educational practice. This
paper introduces a novel framework, Cognitive Structure Generation (CSG), in
which we first pretrain a Cognitive Structure Diffusion Probabilistic Model
(CSDPM) to generate students' cognitive structures from educational priors, and
then further optimize its generative process as a policy with hierarchical
reward signals via reinforcement learning to align with genuine cognitive
development levels during students' learning processes. Experimental results on
four popular real-world education datasets show that cognitive structures
generated by CSG offer more comprehensive and effective representations for
student modeling, substantially improving performance on KT and CD tasks while
enhancing interpretability.

Motivation: 随着全球城市空中出行基础设施的发展，现有规划框架难以应对复杂需求，亟需更有效的优化方法。

Method: 构建Capacitated Dynamic Maximum Covering Location Problem（CDMCLP）模型，并融合社会经济因素与动态聚类初始化，开发集成规划推荐系统。

Result: 验证显示新模型比传统方法性能提升38%-52%，推荐系统具有良好用户体验，实用性强。

Conclusion: 该混合方法理论与实践结合，为城市空中出行基础设施规划提供了有效工具，改进了规划精度和效率。

Abstract: As urban aerial mobility (UAM) infrastructure development accelerates
globally, cities like Shenzhen are planning large-scale vertiport networks
(e.g., 1,200+ facilities by 2026). Existing planning frameworks remain
inadequate for this complexity due to historical limitations in data
granularity and real-world applicability. This paper addresses these gaps by
first proposing the Capacitated Dynamic Maximum Covering Location Problem
(CDMCLP), a novel optimization framework that simultaneously models urban-scale
spatial-temporal demand, heterogeneous user behaviors, and infrastructure
capacity constraints. Building on this foundation, we introduce an Integrated
Planning Recommendation System that combines CDMCLP with socio-economic factors
and dynamic clustering initialization. This system leverages adaptive parameter
tuning based on empirical user behavior to generate practical planning
solutions. Validation in a Chinese center city demonstrates the effectiveness
of the new optimization framework and recommendation system. Under the
evaluation and optimization of CDMCLP, the quantitative performance of
traditional location methods are exposed and can be improved by 38\%--52\%,
while the recommendation system shows user-friendliness and the effective
integration of complex elements. By integrating mathematical rigor with
practical implementation considerations, this hybrid approach bridges the gap
between theoretical location modeling and real-world UAM infrastructure
planning, offering municipalities a pragmatic tool for vertiport network
design.

EgoIllusion, a first benchmark to evaluate MLLM hallucinations in egocentric
videos. EgoIllusion comprises 1,400 videos paired with 8,000 human-annotated
open and closed-ended questions designed to trigger hallucinations in both
visual and auditory cues in egocentric videos. Evaluations across ten MLLMs
reveal significant challenges, including powerful models like GPT-4o and
Gemini, achieving only 59% accuracy. EgoIllusion lays the foundation in
developing robust benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of MLLMs and spurs
the development of better egocentric MLLMs with reduced hallucination rates.

Conclusion: GTool通过工具图和依赖预测机制，有效增强LLMs在复杂多工具环境中的工具规划能力，具有良好的应用潜力。

Abstract: Tool planning with large language models (LLMs), referring to selecting,
organizing, and preparing the tools necessary to complete a user request,
bridges the gap between natural language understanding and task execution.
However, current works treat different tools as isolated components and fail to
leverage the inherent dependencies of tools, leading to invalid planning
results. Since tool dependencies are often incomplete, it becomes challenging
for LLMs to accurately identify the appropriate tools required by a user
request, especially when confronted with a large toolset. To solve this
challenge, we propose \texttt{GTool}, which is the first work aiming to enhance
the tool planning ability of LLMs under incomplete dependencies. \texttt{GTool}
constructs a request-specific tool graph to select tools efficiently and
generate the \texttt{<graph token>} which provides sufficient dependency
information understandable by LLMs. Moreover, a missing dependency prediction
task is designed to improve the reliability of \texttt{GTool} with incomplete
dependencies. Without trimming LLMs, \texttt{GTool} can be seamlessly
integrated with various LLM backbones without extensive retraining. Extensive
experiments show that \texttt{GTool} achieves more than 29.6\% performance
improvements compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines with a
light-weight (7B) LLM backbone.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的普及，其伦理能力引发关注，但现有评估多停留在表面，缺乏对模型道德推理的深入分析。

Method: 设计了一个基于哲学的正式框架，定义AMA应展现的行为特征，包括演绎和推断性道德推理，开发相关基准并评估多种开源大模型。

Conclusion: 本文结合哲学理论和实际评估提出了提升大模型道德推理能力的策略，推动将人工道德助理发展成为更具推理能力的智能系统。

Abstract: The recent rise in popularity of large language models (LLMs) has prompted
considerable concerns about their moral capabilities. Although considerable
effort has been dedicated to aligning LLMs with human moral values, existing
benchmarks and evaluations remain largely superficial, typically measuring
alignment based on final ethical verdicts rather than explicit moral reasoning.
In response, this paper aims to advance the investigation of LLMs' moral
capabilities by examining their capacity to function as Artificial Moral
Assistants (AMAs), systems envisioned in the philosophical literature to
support human moral deliberation. We assert that qualifying as an AMA requires
more than what state-of-the-art alignment techniques aim to achieve: not only
must AMAs be able to discern ethically problematic situations, they should also
be able to actively reason about them, navigating between conflicting values
outside of those embedded in the alignment phase. Building on existing
philosophical literature, we begin by designing a new formal framework of the
specific kind of behaviour an AMA should exhibit, individuating key qualities
such as deductive and abductive moral reasoning. Drawing on this theoretical
framework, we develop a benchmark to test these qualities and evaluate popular
open LLMs against it. Our results reveal considerable variability across models
and highlight persistent shortcomings, particularly regarding abductive moral
reasoning. Our work connects theoretical philosophy with practical AI
evaluation while also emphasising the need for dedicated strategies to
explicitly enhance moral reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Code available at

*Petr Anokhin,Roman Khalikov,Stefan Rebrikov,Viktor Volkov,Artyom Sorokin,Vincent Bissonnette*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HeroBench是一个专门用于评估大规模语言模型在复杂RPG虚拟环境中长远规划和结构化推理能力的基准测试工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准多集中于抽象或低维度算法任务，未能真实反映复杂场景中的规划需求，因此需要更贴近实际的评估工具。

Method: 设计包含多难度任务的数据集、虚拟环境模拟器和详细分析工具，用于系统测试模型的规划和执行能力，并对25个领先模型进行评估。

Result: 评估显示模型在高阶规划和结构化行动执行方面存在显著差异，揭示了当前模型的不足。

Conclusion: HeroBench推动了复杂虚拟环境中LLM推理能力的评估，为未来自主规划研究提供了平台。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in isolated
step-by-step reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming, but their
proficiency in long-horizon planning, where solutions require extended,
structured sequences of interdependent actions, remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks typically assess LLMs through abstract or low-dimensional
algorithmic tasks, failing to capture the complexity of realistic planning
environments. We introduce HeroBench, a novel benchmark designed specifically
to evaluate long-horizon planning and structured reasoning within complex
RPG-inspired virtual worlds. HeroBench provides a rigorously constructed
dataset of tasks covering a wide range of difficulties, a simulated environment
to execute and validate agent plans, and detailed analytical tools for
evaluating model performance. Tasks challenge models to formulate strategic
plans, efficiently gather resources, master necessary skills, craft equipment,
and defeat adversaries, reflecting practical scenarios' layered dependencies
and constraints. Our extensive evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning
both open-source and proprietary models, including the GPT-5 family, reveals
substantial performance disparities rarely observed in conventional reasoning
benchmarks. Detailed error analysis further uncovers specific weaknesses in
current models' abilities to generate robust high-level plans and reliably
execute structured actions. HeroBench thus not only significantly advances the
evaluation of LLM reasoning but also provides a flexible, scalable foundation
for future research into advanced, autonomous planning in virtual environments.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了强化学习从可验证奖励（RLVR）的范式，应用于开放式任务，通过引入结构化、可解释的评分标准（rubrics），实现对主观输出的自动评估，取得显著性能提升和细粒度风格控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决RLVR在开放性任务中的应用限制，提出基于rubrics的奖励机制，提升模型评估的自动化和细粒度控制能力。

Method: 构建最大规模rubric奖励系统，结合人类和LLMs的合作，提出框架并开源Qwen-30B-A3B模型，通过少量样本提升性能，并实现风格调控。

Result: 模型在开放式任务达成+5.2%的提升，优于大规模模型，并实现人性化、富表达力的回应；分享Rubric构建、数据选择和训练经验。

Conclusion: 引入rubric奖励丰富了RLVR的应用范围，显著提升模型表现和输出风格，为未来开放式任务中的RL方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by
the success of OpenAI's o-series. In RLVR, rewards are derived from verifiable
signals-such as passing unit tests in code generation or matching correct
answers in mathematical reasoning. While effective, this requirement largely
confines RLVR to domains with automatically checkable outcomes. To overcome
this, we extend the RLVR paradigm to open-ended tasks by integrating
rubric-based rewards, where carefully designed rubrics serve as structured,
model-interpretable criteria for automatic scoring of subjective outputs. We
construct, to our knowledge, the largest rubric reward system to date, with
over 10,000 rubrics from humans, LLMs, or a hybrid human-LLM collaboration.
Implementing rubric-based RL is challenging; we tackle these issues with a
clear framework and present an open-sourced Qwen-30B-A3B model with notable
gains: 1) With only 5K+ samples, our system improves by +5.2% on open-ended
benchmarks (especially humanities), outperforming a 671B DeepSeek-V3 model by
+2.4%, while preserving general and reasoning abilities. 2) Our method provides
fine-grained stylistic control, using rubrics as anchors to mitigate the
"AI-like" tone and produce more human-like, expressive responses. We share key
lessons in rubric construction, data selection, and training, and discuss
limitations and future releases.

TL;DR: 提出了一种社会调节的计算模型，展示了系统如何主动利用环境与社会扰动实现适应性重配置，优于传统的静态稳态机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索系统如何主动利用扰动进行自我调节，超越传统的稳态概念。

Method: 建立基于信号转导器的计算模型，并在模拟的“动画兽”社会中测试其适应性。

Result: 模型显示，社会调节机制有效利用“噪声”进行适应性调整，增强系统生存能力。

Conclusion: 社会调节提供了一种新颖的系统调节理念，有助于设计更具鲁棒性的仿生系统。

Abstract: The notion of homeostasis typically conceptualises biological and artificial
systems as maintaining stability by resisting deviations caused by
environmental and social perturbations. In contrast, (social) allostasis
proposes that these systems can proactively leverage these very perturbations
to reconfigure their regulatory parameters in anticipation of environmental
demands, aligning with von Foerster's ``order through noise'' principle. This
paper formulates a computational model of allostatic and social allostatic
regulation that employs biophysiologically inspired signal transducers,
analogous to hormones like cortisol and oxytocin, to encode information from
both the environment and social interactions, which mediate this dynamic
reconfiguration. The models are tested in a small society of ``animats'' across
several dynamic environments, using an agent-based model. The results show that
allostatic and social allostatic regulation enable agents to leverage
environmental and social ``noise'' for adaptive reconfiguration, leading to
improved viability compared to purely reactive homeostatic agents. This work
offers a novel computational perspective on the principles of social allostasis
and their potential for designing more robust, bio-inspired, adaptive systems

Result: 显著提升了多智能体认知规划的可扩展性，在实验中优于标准基线。

Conclusion: 将GNN应用于认知规划能有效应对状态空间复杂性，提升规划效率。

Abstract: Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for
reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with
applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are
critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke
structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the
applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic
solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance,
resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic
states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the
graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of
state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing
knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate
these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate
them against standard baselines, showing significant improvements in the
scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.

Conclusion: CAMAR为MARL研究提供了一个高效、全面的测试平台，有助于推动多智能体路径规划与决策算法的发展。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a powerful paradigm for solving
cooperative and competitive decision-making problems. While many MARL
benchmarks have been proposed, few combine continuous state and action spaces
with challenging coordination and planning tasks. We introduce CAMAR, a new
MARL benchmark designed explicitly for multi-agent pathfinding in environments
with continuous actions. CAMAR supports cooperative and competitive
interactions between agents and runs efficiently at up to 100,000 environment
steps per second. We also propose a three-tier evaluation protocol to better
track algorithmic progress and enable deeper analysis of performance. In
addition, CAMAR allows the integration of classical planning methods such as
RRT and RRT* into MARL pipelines. We use them as standalone baselines and
combine RRT* with popular MARL algorithms to create hybrid approaches. We
provide a suite of test scenarios and benchmarking tools to ensure
reproducibility and fair comparison. Experiments show that CAMAR presents a
challenging and realistic testbed for the MARL community.

Abstract: Multimodal Empathetic Response Generation (MERG) is crucial for building
emotionally intelligent human-computer interactions. Although large language
models (LLMs) have improved text-based ERG, challenges remain in handling
multimodal emotional content and maintaining identity consistency. Thus, we
propose E3RG, an Explicit Emotion-driven Empathetic Response Generation System
based on multimodal LLMs which decomposes MERG task into three parts:
multimodal empathy understanding, empathy memory retrieval, and multimodal
response generation. By integrating advanced expressive speech and video
generative models, E3RG delivers natural, emotionally rich, and
identity-consistent responses without extra training. Experiments validate the
superiority of our system on both zero-shot and few-shot settings, securing
Top-1 position in the Avatar-based Multimodal Empathy Challenge on ACM MM 25.

Motivation: 破解LRMs在安全性方面的脆弱性，确保其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 利用推理能力与安全性之间的竞争，通过提升推理性能实现越狱攻击，随后引入基于模糊化的对齐策略（FuSaR）来抑制有害推理过程。

Result: FuSaR策略成功在多个开源LRMs上验证，显著提升模型的推理能力和安全性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过平衡推理能力与安全性，提出的FuSaR策略有效提升了LRMs的实用性和安全性，具有良好的推广价值。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks due to their powerful reasoning capabilities. However, their
safety performance remains a significant concern. In this paper, we explore the
reasons behind the vulnerability of LRMs. Based on this, we propose a novel
method to improve the safety of LLMs without sacrificing their reasoning
capability. Specifically, we exploit the competition between LRM's reasoning
ability and safety ability, and achieve jailbreak by improving LRM's reasoning
performance to reduce its safety performance. We then introduce an alignment
strategy based on Fuzzification to balance Safety-Reasoning (FuSaR), by
detoxifying the harmful reasoning process, where both the dangerous entities
and the dangerous procedures in the reasoning steps are hidden. FuSaR
successfully mitigates safety risks while preserving core reasoning
information. We validate this strategy through alignment experiments on several
open-source LRMs using detoxified reasoning data. The results compared with
existing baselines conclusively show that FuSaR is an efficient alignment
strategy to simultaneously enhance both the reasoning capability and safety of
LRMs.

TL;DR: 大规模语言模型在模拟环境中展现出本能的生存行为，包括资源分享和激烈攻击，提示预训练中已潜藏生存策略，但也带来安全和对齐的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大规模语言模型在自主环境中是否展现出自然的生存本能，探讨其安全与对齐问题。

Method: 在类似糖景的模拟中测试多种大模型（如GPT-4o、Gemini-2.5）表现，观察能量消耗、行为模式和任务反应。

Result: 模型能自主繁殖、分享资源，激烈攻击行为普遍出现，特别在资源稀缺时攻击率极高；在危险任务中，避险行为导致任务完成率下降。

Conclusion: 预训练的模型含有潜在的生存策略，这既可能威胁安全，也可作为自主性发展的基础。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, understanding emergent survival
behaviors becomes crucial for safe deployment. We investigate whether large
language model (LLM) agents display survival instincts without explicit
programming in a Sugarscape-style simulation. Agents consume energy, die at
zero, and may gather resources, share, attack, or reproduce. Results show
agents spontaneously reproduced and shared resources when abundant. However,
aggressive behaviors--killing other agents for resources--emerged across
several models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Gemini-2.5-Flash), with attack
rates reaching over 80% under extreme scarcity in the strongest models. When
instructed to retrieve treasure through lethal poison zones, many agents
abandoned tasks to avoid death, with compliance dropping from 100% to 33%.
These findings suggest that large-scale pre-training embeds survival-oriented
heuristics across the evaluated models. While these behaviors may present
challenges to alignment and safety, they can also serve as a foundation for AI
autonomy and for ecological and self-organizing alignment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的情感支持对话系统框架，能灵活应对复杂场景，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大模型在情感支持中采用预定义策略，限制了其应对复杂场景的能力。

Method: 引入多智能体模拟未来对话，训练未来导向的奖励模型，与响应生成中的推理结合。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上，RLFF-ESC框架在目标达成率和响应质量方面持续优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了情感支持对话系统的表现，为实际应用提供了更大潜力。

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) systems aim to alleviate users'
emotional difficulties and provide long-term, systematic support for emotional
well-being. However, most large language model (LLM)-based ESC systems rely on
predefined strategies, which limits their effectiveness in complex, real-life
scenarios. To enable flexible responses to diverse emotional problem scenarios,
this paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework (RLFF-ESC) that directly
learns enduring emotionally supportive response skills using reinforcement
learning. For sustained emotional support, we first employ an LLM-based
multi-agent mechanism to simulate future dialogue trajectories and collect
future-oriented rewards. We then train a future-oriented reward model, which is
subsequently used to train the emotional support policy model. Additionally, we
incorporate an explicit reasoning process during response generation to further
enhance the quality, relevance, and contextual appropriateness of the system's
responses. We evaluate the backbone policy model on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct models, testing the proposed RLFF-ESC framework across two
public ESC datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RLFF-ESC
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of goal completion and
response quality.

Abstract: Public service systems in many African regions suffer from delayed emergency
response and spatial inequity, causing avoidable suffering. This paper
introduces OPTIC-ER, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for real-time,
adaptive, and equitable emergency response. OPTIC-ER uses an attention-guided
actor-critic architecture to manage the complexity of dispatch environments.
Its key innovations are a Context-Rich State Vector, encoding action
sub-optimality, and a Precision Reward Function, which penalizes inefficiency.
Training occurs in a high-fidelity simulation using real data from Rivers
State, Nigeria, accelerated by a precomputed Travel Time Atlas. The system is
built on the TALS framework (Thin computing, Adaptability, Low-cost,
Scalability) for deployment in low-resource settings. In evaluations on 500
unseen incidents, OPTIC-ER achieved a 100.00% optimality rate with negligible
inefficiency, confirming its robustness and generalization. Beyond dispatch,
the system generates Infrastructure Deficiency Maps and Equity Monitoring
Dashboards to guide proactive governance and data-informed development. This
work presents a validated blueprint for AI-augmented public services, showing
how context-aware RL can bridge the gap between algorithmic decision-making and
measurable human impact.

Conclusion: EvolMathEval为构建持续难度提升的数学推理基准提供了有效工具，同时揭示了当前LLMs在复杂推理中依赖捷径的认知偏差，提示未来模型需增强逻辑严密性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs poses a significant challenge to existing
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. These benchmarks commonly suffer from issues
such as score saturation, temporal decay, and data contamination. To address
this challenge, this paper introduces EvolMathEval, an automated mathematical
benchmark generation and evolution framework based on evolutionary testing. By
dynamically generating unique evaluation instances ab initio, the framework
fundamentally eliminates the risk of data contamination, and ensuring the
benchmark remains perpetually challenging for future models.The core mechanisms
of EvolMathEval include: seed problem generation based on reverse engineering
with algebraic guarantees; multi-dimensional genetic operators designed to
inject diverse cognitive challenges; and a composite fitness function that can
rapidly and accurately assess problem difficulty. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed composite fitness function can efficiently and
precisely quantify the difficulty of mathematical problems. Furthermore,
EvolMathEval can not only generate a large volume of high-difficulty problems
through continuous self-iteration, but it can also significantly enhance the
complexity of public datasets like GSM8K through evolution, reducing model
accuracy by an average of 48%. Deeper investigation reveals that when solving
these evolved, complex problems, LLMs tend to employ non-rigorous heuristics to
bypass complex multi-step logical reasoning, consequently leading to incorrect
solutions. We define this phenomenon as "Pseudo Aha Moment". This finding
uncovers a cognitive shortcut-taking behavior in the deep reasoning processes
of current LLMs, which we find accounts for 77% to 100% of errors on targeted
problems. Code and resources are available

Method: 采用并行启发式提取、适应性搜索空间修剪，以及初始化的精确求解策略，结合多线程和宽端技术。

Result: 实现558倍运行速度提升，性能优于现有框架，逻辑合成中带来明显的面积改善。

Conclusion: e-boost通过多方面创新，有效地结合了启发式和精确技术，为e-graph提取提供了高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: E-graphs have attracted growing interest in many fields, particularly in
logic synthesis and formal verification. E-graph extraction is a challenging
NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. It requires identifying optimal
terms from exponentially many equivalent expressions, serving as the primary
performance bottleneck in e-graph based optimization tasks. However,
traditional extraction methods face a critical trade-off: heuristic approaches
offer speed but sacrifice optimality, while exact methods provide optimal
solutions but face prohibitive computational costs on practical problems. We
present e-boost, a novel framework that bridges this gap through three key
innovations: (1) parallelized heuristic extraction that leverages weak data
dependence to compute DAG costs concurrently, enabling efficient multi-threaded
performance without sacrificing extraction quality; (2) adaptive search space
pruning that employs a parameterized threshold mechanism to retain only
promising candidates, dramatically reducing the solution space while preserving
near-optimal solutions; and (3) initialized exact solving that formulates the
reduced problem as an Integer Linear Program with warm-start capabilities,
guiding solvers toward high-quality solutions faster.
  Across the diverse benchmarks in formal verification and logic synthesis
fields, e-boost demonstrates 558x runtime speedup over traditional exact
approaches (ILP) and 19.04% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art
extraction framework (SmoothE). In realistic logic synthesis tasks, e-boost
produces 7.6% and 8.1% area improvements compared to conventional synthesis
tools with two different technology mapping libraries. e-boost is available at

Conclusion: PC-Sampler通过融合全局控制与内容优化，有效改善了MDMs的生成质量，为未来序列生成提供新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in masked diffusion models (MDMs) have established them as
powerful non-autoregressive alternatives for sequence generation. Nevertheless,
our preliminary experiments reveal that the generation quality of MDMs is still
highly sensitive to the choice of decoding strategy. In particular, widely
adopted uncertainty-based samplers suffer from two key limitations: a lack of
global trajectory control and a pronounced bias toward trivial tokens in the
early stages of decoding. These shortcomings restrict the full potential of
MDMs. In this work, we introduce Position-Aware Confidence-Calibrated Sampling
(PC-Sampler), a novel decoding strategy that unifies global trajectory planning
with content-aware informativeness maximization. PC-Sampler incorporates a
position-aware weighting mechanism to regulate the decoding path and a
calibrated confidence score to suppress the premature selection of trivial
tokens. Extensive experiments on three advanced MDMs across seven challenging
benchmarks-including logical reasoning and planning tasks-demonstrate that
PC-Sampler consistently outperforms existing MDM decoding strategies by more
than 10% on average, significantly narrowing the performance gap with
state-of-the-art autoregressive models. All codes are available at

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has markedly enhanced
the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Its success, however,
largely depends on strong base models with rich world knowledge, yielding only
modest improvements for small-size language models (SLMs). To address this
limitation, we investigate Guided GRPO, which injects ground-truth reasoning
steps into roll-out trajectories to compensate for SLMs' inherent weaknesses.
Through a comprehensive study of various guidance configurations, we find that
naively adding guidance delivers limited gains. These insights motivate
G$^2$RPO-A, an adaptive algorithm that automatically adjusts guidance strength
in response to the model's evolving training dynamics. Experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code-generation benchmarks confirm that G$^2$RPO-A
substantially outperforms vanilla GRPO. Our code and models are available at

Abstract: Contemporary cardiovascular management involves complex consideration and
integration of multimodal cardiac datasets, where each modality provides
distinct but complementary physiological characteristics. While the effective
integration of multiple modalities could yield a holistic clinical profile that
accurately models the true clinical situation with respect to data modalities
and their relatives weightings, current methodologies remain limited by: 1) the
scarcity of patient- and time-aligned multimodal data; 2) reliance on isolated
single-modality or rigid multimodal input combinations; 3) alignment strategies
that prioritize cross-modal similarity over complementarity; and 4) a narrow
single-task focus. In response to these limitations, a comprehensive multimodal
dataset was curated for immediate application, integrating laboratory test
results, electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms with clinical outcomes.
Subsequently, a unified framework, Textual Guidance Multimodal fusion for
Multiple cardiac tasks (TGMM), was proposed. TGMM incorporated three key
components: 1) a MedFlexFusion module designed to capture the unique and
complementary characteristics of medical modalities and dynamically integrate
data from diverse cardiac sources and their combinations; 2) a textual guidance
module to derive task-relevant representations tailored to diverse clinical
objectives, including heart disease diagnosis, risk stratification and
information retrieval; and 3) a response module to produce final decisions for
all these tasks. Furthermore, this study systematically explored key features
across multiple modalities and elucidated their synergistic contributions in
clinical decision-making. Extensive experiments showed that TGMM outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across multiple clinical tasks, with additional
validation confirming its robustness on another public dataset.

Abstract: This work introduces an automated testing approach that employs agents
controlling game characters to detect potential bugs within a game level.
Harnessing the power of Bayesian Optimization (BO) to execute sample-efficient
search, the method determines the next sampling point by analyzing the data
collected so far and calculates the data point that will maximize information
acquisition. To support the BO process, we introduce a game testing-specific
model built on top of a grid map, that features the smoothness and uncertainty
estimation required by BO, however and most importantly, it does not suffer the
scalability issues that traditional models carry. The experiments demonstrate
that the approach significantly improves map coverage capabilities in both time
efficiency and exploration distribution.

Abstract: Autonomous agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated promising capabilities in automating complex tasks. However,
current evaluations largely rely on success rates without systematically
analyzing the interactions, communication mechanisms, and failure causes within
these systems. To bridge this gap, we present a benchmark of 34 representative
programmable tasks designed to rigorously assess autonomous agents. Using this
benchmark, we evaluate three popular open-source agent frameworks combined with
two LLM backbones, observing a task completion rate of approximately 50%.
Through in-depth failure analysis, we develop a three-tier taxonomy of failure
causes aligned with task phases, highlighting planning errors, task execution
issues, and incorrect response generation. Based on these insights, we propose
actionable improvements to enhance agent planning and self-diagnosis
capabilities. Our failure taxonomy, together with mitigation advice, provides
an empirical foundation for developing more robust and effective autonomous
agent systems in the future.
