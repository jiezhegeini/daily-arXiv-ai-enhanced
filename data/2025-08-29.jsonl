These new benchmarks push embeddings\nto work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While\nprior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings,\nthere is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to\nunrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better\ntraining data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may\nencounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely\nsimple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the\nnumber of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of\nsome query is limited by the dimension of the embedding.

The proposed agent,\nincorporating a \"rewriting-resolution-review-revision\" logical chain via three\nreasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,\nrespectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The\nConsultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link\nproblems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem\ndescriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible\nfor generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem\nresolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for\nself-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code\nruntime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable\ncode provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive\nevaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in\nsolving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis\nproblems.

Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations\ncharacterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and\nvarying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning\n(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and\nconvergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional\ntimetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key\ninnovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by\naugmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station\nID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,\nvelocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to\ncapture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs\ninto a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function\naligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway\ndeviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule\nadherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves\nmore stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,\n-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions).

Although the\nmainstream industry solution achieves multi-objective coverage through parallel\nmulti-path single-objective retrieval, this approach leads to linear growth of\ntraining and serving resources with the number of objectives and has inherent\nlimitations in handling loosely coupled objectives. This paper proposes the\nMPFormer, a dynamic multi-task Transformer framework, which systematically\naddresses the aforementioned issues through three innovative mechanisms. First,\nan objective-conditioned transformer that jointly encodes user behavior\nsequences and multi-task semantics through learnable attention modulation;\nsecond, personalized target weights are introduced to achieve dynamic\nadjustment of retrieval results; finally, user personalization information is\nincorporated into token representations and the Transformer structure to\nfurther enhance the model's representation ability.

While\nthe LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still\nface this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are\nless effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.\nFurthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks\nrelationships of weight values within rows or columns.

Recent research has\ndemonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or\nremoving specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,\nwe propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box\nmethod that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its\nactivations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,\nfine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream\nwrite matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set\nof harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently\nincreases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while\npreserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,\nHellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align\n'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,\ndemonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure.

Physical layer\nauthentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel\ncharacteristics.

In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based\nphysical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile\nscenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation\nusing IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated\nbased on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance\ncorrelation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of\nmanually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network\n(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial\ncorrelation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their\nsimilarity.

One of the key challenges in\ndesigning graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that\ncan vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been\nfocused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling\narbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.\nHowever, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in\nthe field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the\nrecent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a\nsimple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.\nSpecifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood\nfeature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to\nthe constructed node representations.

While\nprior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings,\nthere is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to\nunrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better\ntraining data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may\nencounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely\nsimple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the\nnumber of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of\nsome query is limited by the dimension of the embedding.

In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard\nlinear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized\nKaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized\nKaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under\nmild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first\nconvergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that\nSPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic\nloss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a\nfast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first\nexplanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.\nOverall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can\nshed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware\noptimization strategies."}

As a result, these\ncounterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.\n  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that\nproduces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable\noutcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome.

Recent research has\ndemonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or\nremoving specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,\nwe propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box\nmethod that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its\nactivations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,\nfine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream\nwrite matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set\nof harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently\nincreases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while\npreserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,\nHellaSwag, and Arc.

However, when applied to multi-domain scenarios, the transformer\narchitecture's attention maps become a computational bottleneck, as they attend\nto all items across every domain. To tackle this challenge, systems must\nefficiently balance inter and intra-domain knowledge transfer. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel approach for scalable multi-domain recommendation systems by\nreplacing full inter-domain attention with two innovative mechanisms: 1)\nTransition-Aware Positional Embeddings (TAPE): We propose novel positional\nembeddings that account for domain-transition specific information. This allows\nattention to be focused solely on intra-domain items, effectively reducing the\nunnecessary computational cost associated with attending to irrelevant domains.\n2) Dynamic Domain State Representation (DDSR): We introduce a dynamic state\nrepresentation for each domain, which is stored and accessed during subsequent\ntoken predictions. This enables the efficient transfer of relevant domain\ninformation without relying on full attention maps.

While\nprior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings,\nthere is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to\nunrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better\ntraining data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may\nencounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely\nsimple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the\nnumber of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of\nsome query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show\nthat this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the\ntest set with free parameterized embeddings.
