These proposals are then rigorously assessed by a trainable\nmulti-objective critic that explicitly preserves diverse preference structures\nwithout collapsing them into a single scalarization bias.This adversarial\ninterplay, guided by a Pareto frontier selection mechanism, enables iterative\nmulti-round refinement, effectively escaping local optima while preserving\ntrajectory diversity.Extensive experiments on NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks\ndemonstrate SOTA performance, achieving 94.9 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 (surpassing\nDiffusionDrive by 6.8, DriveSuprim by 5.0, and TrajHF by 0.9) and 64.96 Driving\nScore on Bench2Drive.

Regrettably, existing coupon\ndistribution strategies fall far short of effectively leveraging the complex\nsequential interactions between platforms and users.

We then extend these pairwise assessments to four\ngraph-level statistics (prevalence, intensity, variability, extremity).\nCoupling these metrics with a within-graph causal design, we quantify how\nrewiring strategies affect over-squashing on diverse graph- and\nnode-classification benchmarks. Our extensive empirical analyses show that most\ngraph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various\nextents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of\nmitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and\nmethod.

These agents address the limitations of their parametric memory by\ndynamically gathering relevant facts to address complex reasoning tasks.\nHowever, existing approaches suffer from a fundamental architectural\nlimitation: they process search queries strictly sequentially, even when\nhandling inherently parallelizable and logically independent comparisons. This\nsequential bottleneck significantly constrains computational efficiency,\nparticularly for queries that require multiple entity comparisons. To address\nthis critical limitation, we propose ParallelSearch, a novel reinforcement\nlearning framework that empowers large language models (LLMs) to recognize\nparallelizable query structures and execute multiple search operations\nconcurrently. Our approach introduces dedicated reward functions that\nincentivize the identification of independent query components while preserving\nanswer accuracy through jointly considering correctness, query decomposition\nquality, and parallel execution benefits. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate\nthat ParallelSearch outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average\nperformance gain of 2.9% across seven question-answering benchmarks.

However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized\nand difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often\nbenefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can\nthen be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask.\nFor example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first\nselect an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary,\nand then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from\nthe summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms,\nthis setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of\neach LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success. Thus,\nunlike single LLM selection, the quality of each subtask's output directly\naffects the inputs, and hence the cost and success rate, of downstream LLMs,\ncreating complex performance dependencies that must be learned and accounted\nfor during selection.

The HAH-Delphi was tested in three\nphases: retrospective replication, prospective comparison, and applied\ndeployment in two applied domains (endurance training and resistance and mixed\ncardio/strength training). The AI replicated 95% of published expert consensus\nconclusions in Phase I and showed 95% directional agreement with senior human\nexperts in Phase II, though it lacked experiential and pragmatic nuance. In\nPhase III, compact panels of six senior experts achieved >90% consensus\ncoverage and reached thematic saturation before the final participant. The AI\nprovided consistent, literature-grounded scaffolding that supported divergence\nresolution and accelerated saturation. The HAH-Delphi framework offers a\nflexible, scalable approach for generating high-quality, context-sensitive\nconsensus. Its successful application across health, coaching, and performance\nscience confirms its methodological robustness and supports its use as a\nfoundation for generating conditional, personalised guidance and published\nconsensus frameworks at scale."}

Previous approaches have tried to address this by treating the\npreviously trained model as an inseparable unit and using techniques to\nmaintain old behaviors while learning new knowledge. These approaches, however,\ndo not account for the fact that previously acquired knowledge at different\ntimestamps contributes differently to learning new tasks.

In this\nwork, we address these challenges and introduce DQInit, a method that adapts\nvalue function initialization to DRL.

However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized\nand difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often\nbenefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can\nthen be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask.\nFor example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first\nselect an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary,\nand then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from\nthe summarized record.
