*Omran Abbas,Abdullah Zayat,Loıc Markley,Anas Chaaban*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种非线性智能超表面（SIS）技术，可以模拟神经网络的行为，并能通过形成复杂的信号模式来提高无线通信的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的线性SIS模型在功能上存在局限性，无法满足无线通信的更高要求，因此需要开发能够模仿神经网络行为的非线性SIS，以释放SIS的全部潜力。

Method: 提出了一种非线性SIS单元，具有阶梯状响应。并通过优化SIS结构来最小化MIMO系统中的符号错误率（SER），实验中SIS被部署在发送端和接收端，并且仅使用了统计信道信息。

Result: 与线性SIS相比，非线性SIS能够通过形成复杂的信号模式来提高通信的可靠性，这些模式能提供更高的抗噪声干扰分集能力，同时接收端仍能识别这些模式。

Conclusion: 非线性SIS技术在无线通信领域具有广阔的应用前景，能够通过模仿神经网络的行为来增强通信性能。

Abstract: Stacked intelligent surfaces (SIS) are a promising technology for
next-generation wireless systems, offering an opportunity to enhance
communication performance with low power consumption. Typically, an SIS is
modelled as a surface that imparts phase shifts on impinging electromagnetic
signals to achieve desired communication objectives. However, this mode of
operation results in a linear SIS, which limits its applicability to linear
operations. To unlock further SIS potential, we propose a nonlinear SIS that
can mimic the behaviour of nonlinear neural networks. We discuss the
feasibility and potential of this idea and propose a nonlinear SIS unit cell
with a step-like response. To evaluate the system-level performance of
nonlinear SIS, we present a case study where SIS structures are optimized to
minimize the symbol error rate (SER) in an MIMO system with SIS deployed at
both the transmitter and receiver sides using only statistical channel
information. We demonstrate that a nonlinear SIS can improve communication
reliability compared to a linear SIS by forming complex signal patterns across
the SIS surface, which provide higher diversity against noise disturbances,
while still allowing the receiver to discern these patterns. Finally, we
outline several potential applications of nonlinear SIS in wireless
communication scenarios.

### [2] [Communication in a Fractional World: MIMO MC-OTFS Precoder Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23832)
*Evan Allen,Karim Said,Robert Calderbank,Lingjia Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: OTFS 延迟-多普勒表示可用于高移动性 MIMO 通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信道状态信息（CSI）反馈方案难以支持高移动性通信场景（如 MANET、VANET 和 FANET）。

Method: 推导了 OTFS 输入输出关系随时间的变化表达式，并构建了一个基于物理的复指数基展开模型预测框架，以最大限度地利用过时的 CSI。

Result: 所提出的框架可以有效地处理整数和分数延迟-多普勒信道，并支持高移动性 MIMO 通信。

Conclusion: OTFS 延迟-多普勒表示为在高移动性场景中实现可靠的 MIMO 通信提供了一种有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: As 6G technologies advance, international bodies and regulatory agencies are
intensifying efforts to extend seamless connectivity especially for
high-mobility scenarios such as Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (\textit{MANETs}) types
such as Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (\textit{VANETs}) and Flying Ad-Hoc Networks
(\textit{FANETs}). For these environments to be considered for long term
adoption and use they must support Multiple-Input-Multiple- (MIMO) technology,
rapidly fluctuating channel conditions in these environments place a heavy
burden on traditional time-frequency CSI feedback schemes required for MIMO
precoding. This motivates a shift toward delay-Doppler representations like
those employed by Orthogonal Time-Frequency Space(OTFS) modulation, which
offers greater stability under mobility. We derive an expression for the
variation over time in the OTFS I/O relationship. We then use this to create a
physics informed complex exponential basis expansion model prediction framework
that maximizes the usefulness of outdated Channel State Information (CSI) in
the presence of integer and fractional delay-Doppler channels and facilitates
high mobility MIMO communication.

### [3] [Coordinated Multipoint Transmission in Pinching Antenna Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23837)
*Ali Amhaz,Shreya Khisa,Mohamed Elhattab,Chadi Assi,Sanaa Sharafeddine*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种利用捏合天线系统（PASS）的双基站协作多点（CoMP）传输方案，通过联合优化波束成形向量和捏合位置来最大化用户和速率，并利用梯度元学习（GML）算法解决了非凸优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了克服传统MIMO系统中的大尺度衰落以及传统CoMP系统中ULAs导致的速率上限限制，本研究旨在利用PASS技术提升CoMP系统的性能。

Method: 提出了一种非凸优化问题，旨在最大化可实现的和速率，同时满足用户的服务质量（QoS）要求。该问题通过梯度元学习（GML）策略进行求解。

Result: 提出的GML方法实现了最优解的92%，优于其他基准方法，并提高了可实现速率的上限。

Conclusion: GML方法能够有效地解决CoMP系统中的优化问题，并显著提升系统的和速率和性能上限。

Abstract: We study a coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission where two base
stations (BSs), each supported by a pinching antenna system (PASS), are
deployed to jointly serve communication users under spatial division multiple
access (SDMA) technology. Pinching Antenna technology was introduced as a
promising solution to overcome the large-scale fading that has been shown to be
an impediment in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To realize the
advantages of this technology in CoMP systems, which suffer from an upperbound
rate limitation when traditional uniform linear arrays (ULAs) are adopted, we
formulate an optimization problem with the aim of maximizing the achievable sum
rate by jointly determining the transmit beamforming vectors and pinching
locations on the waveguides while respecting the quality of service (QoS)
requirements of users. This problem is inherently non-convex due to the strong
coupling among its decision parameters, making it challenging to solve using
traditional optimization methods. Thus, we utilize a gradient-based
meta-learning (GML) strategy specifically designed for large-scale optimization
tasks. Finally, numerical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the
proposed GML approach, achieving 92 percent of the optimal solution, and the
superiority of the solution presented compared to other benchmarks. In
addition, it achieves a higher upper bound on the achievable rate compared to
conventional CoMP systems.

### [4] [Accurate Prediction of Nonlinear Distortion of Multi-Carrier Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23844)
*Cameron M. Pike,Brad Oney,Gabriel Hepner,Animesh Yadav*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种使用特征函数（ch.f.）级数形式来预测功率放大器（PA）中稀疏多载波信号非线性失真的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确预测非线性失真对于在输出功率和网络吞吐量之间进行设计权衡至关重要，因为功率放大器中的非线性会影响多载波调制技术。

Method: 提出了一种利用特征函数（ch.f.）级数形式来预测稀疏多载波信号失真频谱的方法。该方法将非线性表示为前向散射参数（S21）或跨导函数的快速傅里叶变换（FFT），并将信号失真贡献表示为干净频谱的数值自卷积。

Result: 该方法在理论和实践上都得到了验证。理论上，将信号建模为带限高斯过程并进行硬限制，结果与经典Price定理相同。实践中，通过对具有片段化频谱的OFDM信号进行仿真，并将其应用于进入压缩状态的放大器，验证了该方法在Price定理难以应用的情况下，预测的输出频谱与实验室测量结果一致。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效地计算信号和失真分量，并且可以轻松地计算和参数化信噪比（SDR）与过驱动电平等变量的关系。

Abstract: Nonlinearities in power amplifiers adversely affect multi-carrier modulation
techniques. Accurate prediction of nonlinear distortion is essential for making
design trade-offs between output power and network throughput. We use the
series form of the characteristic function (ch.f.) method to predict distortion
spectra for sparse multi-carrier transmissions. This method results in
efficient calculations of individual signal and distortion components. The
method is validated both theoretically and practically. Theoretical validation
is performed by modeling the signal as a bandpass Gaussian process that is hard
limited, and it is shown that the series ch.f. method produces results that are
identical with the classical Price's theorem. Practical validation is shown by
considering an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal with a
fragmented spectrum which is then applied to an amplifier driven into
compression for which application of Price's theorem is difficult, and the
predicted output spectrum corroborates laboratory measurements. Part of the
computational efficiency is realized in that the nonlinearity can be expressed
as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of samples of its forward scattering
parameter (i.e., S21) or transconductance function (including AM-PM effects),
and distortion contributions of the signal can be expressed as numerical
autoconvolutions of the clean spectrum. Signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) can be
easily computed and parameterized across variables of interest, such as
overdrive level.

### [5] [Learning-based Spectral Regression for Cocoa Bean Physicochemical Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23892)
*Kebin Contreras,Emmanuel Martinez,Brayan Monroy,Sebastian Ardila,Cristian Ramirez,Mariana Caicedo,Hans Garcia,Tatiana Gelvez-Barrera,Juan Poveda-Jaramillo,Henry Arguello,Jorge Bacca*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种利用可见光和近红外光谱技术结合机器学习模型来评估可可豆质量的方法，实现了对发酵程度、水分含量、多酚浓度和镉含量等关键理化性质的快速、无损预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可可豆质量评估方法耗时、有损且难以规模化，因此需要快速、可靠、无损的替代方法。

Method: 该方法使用集成了可见光-近红外光谱仪的输送带系统，并结合学习回归模型来预测光谱信号与关键理化性质的关系。通过 Santander、哥伦比亚以及其他哥伦比亚地区和秘鲁库斯科的样本构建数据集，并使用标准化实验室分析获得参考值。

Result: 所提出的模型在所有理化性质的预测上均取得了超过0.98的R²分数，并且在地理上独立的样本上达到了0.96的准确率。

Conclusion: 该无损方法为可可豆生产链中质量评估提供了一种合适且可扩展的替代传统实验室方法的技术。

Abstract: Cocoa bean quality assessment is essential for ensuring compliance with
commercial standards, protecting consumer health, and increasing the market
value of the cocoa product. The quality assessment estimates key
physicochemical properties, such as fermentation level, moisture content,
polyphenol concentration, and cadmium content, among others. This assessment
has traditionally relied on the accurate estimation of these properties via
visual or sensory evaluation, jointly with laboratory-based physicochemical
analyses, which are often time-consuming, destructive, and difficult to scale.
This creates the need for rapid, reliable, and noninvasive alternatives.
Spectroscopy, particularly in the visible and near-infrared ranges, offers a
non-invasive alternative by capturing the molecular signatures associated with
these properties. Therefore, this work introduces a scalable methodology for
evaluating the quality of cocoa beans by predicting key physicochemical
properties from the spectral signatures of cocoa beans. This approach utilizes
a conveyor belt system integrated with a VIS-NIR spectrometer, coupled with
learning-based regression models. Furthermore, a dataset is built using cocoa
bean batches from Santander, Colombia. Ground-truth reference values were
obtained through standardized laboratory analyses and following commercial
cocoa quality regulations. To further evaluate the proposed methodology's
generalization, performance is tested on samples collected from other Colombian
regions and from Cusco, Peru. Experimental results show that the proposed
models achieved R2 scores exceeding 0.98 across all physicochemical properties,
and reached 0.96 accuracy on geographically independent samples. This
non-destructive approach represents a suitable and scalable alternative to
conventional laboratory methods for quality assessment across the cocoa
production chain.

Method: 从第一性原理出发，对PSD进行了相干推导，能够复现现有文献的结果，并解释主要PSD特征与传播几何参数之间的因果关系。

Result: 推导了LEO到地面接收器信道模型的PSD，能够复现现有文献的结果，并解释了PSD特征与传播几何参数之间的因果关系。

Conclusion: 提出了一个几何感知的NLOS链路模型，能够更好地理解和表征LEO到地面通信中的信道特性。

Abstract: This paper presents a new derivation of LEO-to-ground receiver channel model
to address a clear gap in the prior art: the lack of an appropriate geometry
aware characterization of non LOS (NLOS) link model represented by the power
spectral density (PSD). Specifically, the main contribution is a coherent
derivation of the PSD from 1st principles that is able to reproduce results in
prior art and explain the causal relationship of main PSD features to the
propagation geometry parameters.

### [7] [Inferring Group Intent as a Cooperative Game. An NLP-based Framework for Trajectory Analysis using Graph Transformer Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23905)
*Yiming Zhang,Vikram Krishnamurthy,Shashwat Jain*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本研究将群体目标轨迹意图建模为一个合作博弈的 outcome，其中复杂时空轨迹由基于NLP的生成模型建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何将群体轨迹意图形式化为合作博弈的特征函数，以及如何从噪声观测中推断这种意图。

Method: 提出了一种基于 Fisher 信息量的合作博弈特征函数，并开发了一个基于NLP和形式语法的生成模型来生成协调的时空轨迹。为了推断意图，训练了一个图Transformer神经网络（GTNN）。

Result: 所提出的特征函数能够生成协调的时空模式，GTNN能够高精度地从观测数据中推断出群体轨迹意图。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个跨越目标跟踪（贝叶斯信号处理）和GTNN（用于群体意图推断）的多层方法。

Abstract: This paper studies group target trajectory intent as the outcome of a
cooperative game where the complex-spatio trajectories are modeled using an
NLP-based generative model. In our framework, the group intent is specified by
the characteristic function of a cooperative game, and allocations for players
in the cooperative game are specified by either the core, the Shapley value, or
the nucleolus. The resulting allocations induce probability distributions that
govern the coordinated spatio-temporal trajectories of the targets that reflect
the group's underlying intent. We address two key questions: (1) How can the
intent of a group trajectory be optimally formalized as the characteristic
function of a cooperative game? (2) How can such intent be inferred from noisy
observations of the targets? To answer the first question, we introduce a
Fisher-information-based characteristic function of the cooperative game, which
yields probability distributions that generate coordinated spatio-temporal
patterns. As a generative model for these patterns, we develop an NLP-based
generative model built on formal grammar, enabling the creation of realistic
multi-target trajectory data. To answer the second question, we train a Graph
Transformer Neural Network (GTNN) to infer group trajectory intent-expressed as
the characteristic function of the cooperative game-from observational data
with high accuracy. The self-attention function of the GTNN depends on the
track estimates. Thus, the formulation and algorithms provide a multi-layer
approach that spans target tracking (Bayesian signal processing) and the GTNN
(for group intent inference).

### [8] [Machine Learning-Driven User Localization in RIS-Assisted Wireless Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23908)
*M. T. Hassan,D. Zelenchuk,M. A. B. Abbasi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于机器学习的RIS辅助通信用户定位框架，以解决6G毫米波频段中RIS带来的波束搜索空间增大的问题，通过预测用户角度位置，实现更快的波束对齐和更低的延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G URLLC需要精确的波束对齐，但RIS会扩大波束搜索空间，导致传统方法效率低下。

Method: 收集27 GHz频段下，不同用户位置的接收信号功率（Pr）数据，构建数据集，并训练包括决策树（DT）、支持向量回归（SVR）、K近邻（KNN）、XGBoost、梯度提升和随机森林在内的多种回归模型。在实际应用中，用户报告四个扇区的接收功率值，控制器可实时预测其角度位置。

Result: 决策树（DT）模型实现了4.8度的平均绝对误差（MAE）和0.96的R方值（R2），预测的辐射方向图与真实值高度吻合。该框架能够有效减少波束探测，实现更快的对齐并降低延迟。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于机器学习的RIS辅助通信用户定位框架，能够高精度地预测用户角度位置，显著减少波束搜索时间，提高6G网络的效率。

Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) targets ultra reliable, low latency (URLLC) gigabit
connectivity in mmWave bands, where directional channels require precise beam
alignment. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) reshape wave propagation
and extend coverage, but they enlarge the beam search space at the base
station, making exhaustive sweeps inefficient due to control overhead and
latency. We propose an ML based user localization framework for RIS assisted
communication at 27 GHz. A 20x20 RIS reflects signals from a core network
connected base station and sweeps beams across the 0-90 degree elevation plane,
divided into four angular sectors. We build a dataset by recording received
signal power (Pr in dBm) across user locations and train multiple regressors,
including decision tree (DT), support vector regressor (SVR), k nearest
neighbor (KNN), XGBoost, gradient boosting, and random forest. In operation, an
unknown user in the same plane measures four received power values (one per
sector) and reports them to the pretrained RIS controller, which predicts the
user's angular position in real time. Evaluation using mean absolute error
(MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R squared (R2) shows high accuracy.
The DT model achieves an MAE of 4.8 degrees with R2 = 0.96, while other models
reach 70 to 86 percent. Predicted radiation patterns, including main lobe
alignment between 52 and 55 degrees, closely track ground truth. The framework
reduces beam probing, enables faster alignment, and lowers latency for RIS
assisted 6G networks.

### [9] [Localized Acoustic-Event Measurement Probe: Connector Confirmation Utilizing Acoustic Signatures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24017)
*Brian Skoglind,Travis Roberts,Sourabh Karmakar,Cameron Turner,Laine Mears*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 手动连接的电子产品易出现连接松动或缺失，导致停机和返工。本研究提出一种基于声学特征的连接检测方法，通过背景噪声抑制和目标声音放大，提高了检测的准确性和可靠性，且无需修改现有工艺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动连接电子产品中的连接器时，由于连接器种类繁多、位置不定以及连接件材质的柔性，人工连接常导致连接松动或缺失，引发意外停机和昂贵的返工。现有检测方法（如视觉、AR、电路参数测量）效果有限，而连接器在成功对接时会产生特定的声音，但基于声学的连接验证研究尚不充分，主要是因为植物环境的复杂声场导致信噪比较低。

Method: 提出一种结合物理噪声抑制系统和特定噪声信号放大算法的声学验证方法，以提高连接器对接声音与工厂背景噪声的信噪比，从而改进连接成功检测的性能。

Result: 该声学验证解决方案在检测和分类连接状态方面达到了超过75%的准确率，并且无需对现有手动连接工艺进行任何修改。

Conclusion: 本研究成功开发了一种无需修改现有手动连接工艺的声学验证方法，通过有效的噪声抑制和信号放大，提高了电子连接检测的准确性，解决了手动连接中存在的连接问题。

Abstract: Modern consumer products are full of interconnected electrical and electronic
modules to fulfill direct and indirect needs. In an automated assembly line
still, most of these interconnections are required to be done manually due to
the large variety of connector types, connector positions, and the soft,
flexible nature of their structures. The manual connection points are the
source of partial or completely loose connections. Sometimes connections are
missed due to the application of unequal mating forces and natural human
fatigue. Subsequently, these defects can lead to unexpected downtime and
expensive rework. For successful connection detection, past approaches such as
vision verification, Augmented Reality, or circuit parameter-based measurements
have shown limited ability to detect the correct connection state. Though most
connections emit a specific noise for successful mating, the acoustic-based
verification system for electrical connection confirmation has not been
extensively researched. The main discouraging reason for such research is the
typically low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between the sound of a pair of
electrical connector mating and the diverse soundscape of the plant. In this
study, the authors investigated increasing the SNR between the electrical
connector mating sound and the plant soundscape to improve connection success
detection by employing a physical system for background noise mitigation and
the successful met noise signature amplification algorithm. The solution is
over 75% effective at detecting and classifying connection state. The solution
has been constructed without any modification to the existing manual
interconnection process.

### [10] [PULSE: Privileged Knowledge Transfer from Electrodermal Activity to Low-Cost Sensors for Stress Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24058)
*Zihan Zhao,Masood Mortazavi,Ning Yan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为PULSE的框架，用于在可穿戴设备中进行压力检测。该框架利用了电活动（EDA）信号，但其主要创新在于，在预训练阶段仅使用EDA信号，而在实际应用中，即使没有EDA信号，也能仅通过心电图（ECG）、容积脉搏波（BVP）、加速度计（ACC）和温度（TEMP）等常用传感器进行压力推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于EDA信号在压力检测中很重要，但其硬件成本高昂，在现实世界的可穿戴设备中难以获得，因此需要一种新的方法。

Method: PULSE框架将编码器输出分为共享和私有嵌入。它在不同模态之间对齐共享嵌入，并将它们融合为一种与模态无关的表示。私有嵌入则包含特定模态的信息，用于支持重建目标。在预训练阶段之后，利用一个冻结的EDA教师模型将交感神经兴奋的表示传递给学生编码器。

Result: 在WESAD数据集上，PULSE框架实现了强大的压力检测性能，证明了EDA信号所学到的表示可以转移到低成本传感器上，从而提高准确性并降低硬件成本。

Conclusion: PULSE框架能够有效地将在预训练阶段通过EDA信号学习到的压力表示转移到仅使用ECG、BVP、ACC和TEMP等低成本传感器进行推断的学生模型上，从而在降低硬件成本的同时提高压力检测的准确性。

Abstract: Electrodermal activity (EDA), the primary signal for stress detection,
requires costly hardware often unavailable in real-world wearables. In this
paper, we propose PULSE, a framework that utilizes EDA exclusively during
self-supervised pretraining, while enabling inference without EDA but with more
readily available modalities such as ECG, BVP, ACC, and TEMP. Our approach
separates encoder outputs into shared and private embeddings. We align shared
embeddings across modalities and fuse them into a modality-invariant
representation. The private embeddings carry modality-specific information to
support the reconstruction objective. Pretraining is followed by knowledge
transfer where a frozen EDA teacher transfers sympathetic-arousal
representations into student encoders. On WESAD, our method achieves strong
stress-detection performance, showing that representations of privileged EDA
can be transferred to low-cost sensors to improve accuracy while reducing
hardware cost.

*Kwadwo Mensah Obeng Afrane,Yang Miao,André B. J. Kokkeler*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为“子带全双工”（Sub-band Full-duplex, SBFD）的新型双工方案，用于在蜂窝小区内海量MIMO（cell-free massive MIMO）系统中实现通信和感知功能的联合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的全双工系统在通信和感知一体化系统中存在自干扰和相互干扰的问题，而SBFD方案通过在不同频率子带上进行上/下行传输，有效解决了这些干扰问题。

Method: 提出了一种SBFD蜂窝小区内海量MIMO系统，其中下行（雷达）子带用于目标照明，上行（通信）子带用于用户通信。假设子带间干扰得到有效抑制，可以独立处理通信和雷达信号。

Result: 仿真结果表明，在SBFD蜂窝小区内海量MIMO联合通信感知系统中，每个接入点（AP）能够高精度地估计感知参数。

Conclusion: SBFD是一种可行的双工方案，能够有效地在蜂窝小区内海量MIMO系统中实现通信和感知的联合，并保证参数估计的精度。

Abstract: In-band Full-duplex joint communication and sensing systems require self
interference cancellation as well as decoupling of the mutual interference
between UL communication signals and radar echoes. We present sub-band
full-duplex as an alternative duplexing scheme to achieve simultaneous uplink
communication and target parameter estimation in a cell-free massive MIMO
system. Sub-band full-duplex allows uplink and downlink transmissions
simultaneously on non-overlapping frequency resources via explicitly defined
uplink and downlink sub-bands in each timeslot. Thus, we propose a sub-band
full-duplex cell-free massive MIMO system with active downlink sensing on
downlink sub-bands and uplink communication on uplink sub-band. In the proposed
system, the target illumination signal is transmitted on the downlink (radar)
sub-band whereas uplink users transmit on the uplink (communication) sub-band.
By assuming efficient suppression of inter-sub-band interference between radar
and communication sub-bands, uplink communication and radar signals can be
efficiently processed without mutual interference. We show that each AP can
estimate sensing parameters with high accuracy in SBFD cell-free massive MIMO
JCAS systems.

*Tailai Wen,Da Ke,Xiang Wang,Zhitao Huang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 自动调制分类（AMC）的进步促进了非合作通信场景中信号传感和识别技术的发展，但也使窃听者能够有效地拦截用户信号。为保护通信链路中的用户隐私，我们优化了对抗性示例生成模型，并引入了一种用于生成传输信号的对抗性扰动的新框架。该框架在时域和频域中实现了双域约束，确保对抗性扰动无法被过滤掉。对比实验证实了所提出方法的优越性以及所生成对抗性示例的隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非合作通信场景下的信号传感与识别技术的发展，以及为了保护通信链路中的用户隐私，需要一种能够生成难以被过滤且具有良好隐蔽性的对抗性扰动的方法。

Method: 通过优化对抗性示例生成模型，并引入一种在时域和频域中都实现了双域约束的新框架，来生成传输信号的对抗性扰动。

Result: 所提出的方法能够生成具有良好隐蔽性的对抗性示例，并且优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种在时域和频域中都实现了双域约束的对抗性扰动生成框架，能够有效保护用户隐私，并且实验证明了其优越性和隐蔽性。

Abstract: The advancements in Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) have propelled
the development of signal sensing and identification technologies in
non-cooperative communication scenarios but also enable eavesdroppers to
effectively intercept user signals in wireless communication environments. To
protect user privacy in communication links, we have optimized the adversarial
example generation model and introduced a novel framework for generating
adversarial perturbations for transmitted signals. This framework implements
dual-domain constraints in both the time and frequency domains, ensuring that
the adversarial perturbation cannot be filtered out. Comparative experiments
confirm the superiority of the proposed method and the concealment of the
adversarial examples it generates.

### [13] [Pilot Distortion Design for ToA Obfuscation in Uplink OFDM Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24223)
*Mahmut Kemal Ercan,Alireza Pourafzal,Musa Furkan Keskin,Sinan Gezici,Henk Wymeersch*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出一种在OFDM上行链路中通过引入特定失真来干扰到达时间（ToA）估计的方法，同时最小化对通信性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在单基站场景下，通过干扰ToA估计来混淆定位信息，同时保持通信性能。

Method: 设计一种复杂的、每子载波的失真向量，以最大化模糊度函数（MAF）的旁瓣与主瓣之比以及旁瓣的总能量，同时满足功率和与通信最优导频的相似度约束。通信影响通过基于容量的下界来量化，该下界由失配信道估计的最小均方误差协方叉得到。使用Dinkelbach变换和差分凸更新（具有闭式KKT步骤）来求解优化问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的失真可以有效增加MAF的旁瓣并降低延迟估计精度，同时仅带来很小的容量损失。

Conclusion: 该方法无需协议更改或人工路径注入，能够在通信约束下通过信号层面控制ToA的可观测性。

Abstract: We study uplink orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) pilot
distortion to deliberately obfuscate time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation at a
single base station while preserving communication performance. We design a
complex per-subcarrier distortion vector that increases sidelobes of the
mismatched ambiguity function (MAF) relative to its mainlobe, using two
objectives: the sidelobe-to-peak level ratio and the integrated sidelobe level.
The design is subject to a transmit-power budget and a proximity
(dissimilarity) constraint around the communication-optimal pilot.
Communication impact is quantied by a capacity-motivated lower bound obtained
from the linear minimum mean-squared error error covariance with a mismatched
channel estimate. The resulting generalized fractional program is solved with
Dinkelbach's transform and a difference-of-convex update that yields a
closed-form Karush-Kuhn-Tucker step. Simulations on a single-input
single-output OFDM link show that the optimized distortions raise MAF sidelobes
and degrade delay estimation, as validated by a mismatched maximum-likelihood
ToA estimator, while incurring only marginal capacity loss over a broad
signal-to-noise ratio range. The method requires no protocol changes or
artificial path injection and provides a signal-level mechanism to control ToA
observability under communication constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a full-duplex (FD) Integrated Sensing and
Communication (ISAC) system, in which the base station (BS) performs downlink
and uplink communications with multiple users while simultaneously sensing
multiple targets. In the scope of this work, we assume a narrowband and static
scenario, aiming to focus on the beamforming and power allocation strategies.
We propose a joint beamforming strategy for designing transmit and receive
beamformer vectors at the BS. The optimization problem aims to maximize the
communication sum-rate, which is critical for ensuring high-quality service to
users, while also maintaining accurate sensing performance for detection tasks
and adhering to maximum power constraints for efficient resource usage. The
optimal receive beamformers are first derived using a closed-form Generalized
Rayleigh Quotient (GRQ) solution, reducing the variables to be optimized. Then,
the remaining problem is solved using floating-point Genetic Algorithms (GA).
The numerical results show that the proposed GA-based solution demonstrates up
to a 98% enhancement in sum-rate compared to a baseline half-duplex ISAC system
and provides better performance than a benchmark algorithm from the literature.
Additionally, it offers insights into sensing performance effects on beam
patterns as well as communicationsensing trade-offs in multi-target scenarios.

TL;DR: 通过数字孪生技术构建未知环境下的无人机通信网络，优化轨迹设计以缩短任务时间和提高安全性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在地面网络不可用时，无人机（UAV）成为低空无线网络（LAWN）的关键，但未知环境下的高效安全轨迹设计充满挑战。

Method: 提出一个由数字孪生（DT）辅助的训练和部署框架。在该框架中，无人机利用集成传感和通信信号为地面用户提供服务，同时收集回声数据以构建和更新数字孪生中的虚拟环境（VE）。在此基础上，开发了一种结合模拟退火（SA）进行用户调度和双延迟深度确定性策略梯度（TD3）算法进行连续轨迹设计的方案，以最小化任务完成时间和确保避障。

Result: 仿真结果表明，与基线方法相比，所提出的方法实现了更快的收敛速度、更高的飞行安全性以及更短的任务完成时间。

Conclusion: 该框架为在未知环境中部署LAWN提供了一个鲁棒且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as key enablers for low-altitude
wireless network (LAWN), particularly when terrestrial networks are
unavailable. In such scenarios, the environmental topology is typically
unknown; hence, designing efficient and safe UAV trajectories is essential yet
challenging. To address this, we propose a digital twin (DT)-assisted training
and deployment framework. In this framework, the UAV transmits integrated
sensing and communication signals to provide communication services to ground
users, while simultaneously collecting echoes that are uploaded to the DT
server to progressively construct virtual environments (VEs). These VEs
accelerate model training and are continuously updated with real-time UAV
sensing data during deployment, supporting decision-making and enhancing flight
safety. Based on this framework, we further develop a trajectory design scheme
that integrates simulated annealing for efficient user scheduling with the
twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm for continuous
trajectory design, aiming to minimize mission completion time while ensuring
obstacle avoidance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach
achieves faster convergence, higher flight safety, and shorter mission
completion time compared with baseline methods, providing a robust and
efficient solution for LAWN deployment in unknown environments.

TL;DR: 预测加压素起始比预测低血压更有临床意义，XGBoost模型在MIMIC-III数据库中表现良好，AUROC为0.822。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的低血压预测模型忽视了临床治疗决策，而预测加压素（血管活性或正性药物）的起始能够更好地反映真实的临床决策过程。

Method: 使用MIMIC-III数据库，将加压素的起始建模为15分钟内的二元事件。输入特征包括来自2小时滑动平均血压（MAP）窗口的统计描述符，以及人口统计学、生物识别、合并症和正在进行的治疗。训练了Extreme Gradient Boosting（XGBoost）模型，并使用SHapley Additive exPlanations（SHAP）进行了解释。

Result: XGBoost模型达到了0.822（0.813-0.830）的AUROC，优于低血压基线（MAP < 65, AUROC 0.686 [0.675-0.699]）。SHAP分析显示，最近的MAP值、MAP趋势以及正在进行的治疗（如镇静剂、电解质）是主要的预测因子。在男性、年轻患者（<53岁）、较高BMI（>32）以及无合并症或合并用药的患者亚组中，模型表现更好。

Conclusion: 基于MAP动态、治疗背景和患者特征预测加压素起始，有助于支持治疗升级的关键决策，将焦点从基于阈值的警报转移到可操作的决策支持。该方法在自然事件失衡的广泛ICU队列中是可行的。未来的工作应丰富时间/生理背景，扩展标签定义以包括治疗升级，并与现有的低血压预测系统进行基准测试。

Abstract: Hypotension in critically ill ICU patients is common and life-threatening.
Escalation to catecholamine therapy marks a key management step, with both
undertreatment and overtreatment posing risks. Most machine learning (ML)
models predict hypotension using fixed MAP thresholds or MAP forecasting,
overlooking the clinical decision behind treatment escalation. Predicting
catecholamine initiation, the start of vasoactive or inotropic agent
administration offers a more clinically actionable target reflecting real
decision-making. Using the MIMIC-III database, we modeled catecholamine
initiation as a binary event within a 15-minute prediction window. Input
features included statistical descriptors from a two-hour sliding MAP context
window, along with demographics, biometrics, comorbidities, and ongoing
treatments. An Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was trained and
interpreted via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The model achieved an
AUROC of 0.822 (0.813-0.830), outperforming the hypotension baseline (MAP < 65,
AUROC 0.686 [0.675-0.699]). SHAP analysis highlighted recent MAP values, MAP
trends, and ongoing treatments (e.g., sedatives, electrolytes) as dominant
predictors. Subgroup analysis showed higher performance in males, younger
patients (<53 years), those with higher BMI (>32), and patients without
comorbidities or concurrent medications. Predicting catecholamine initiation
based on MAP dynamics, treatment context, and patient characteristics supports
the critical decision of when to escalate therapy, shifting focus from
threshold-based alarms to actionable decision support. This approach is
feasible across a broad ICU cohort under natural event imbalance. Future work
should enrich temporal and physiological context, extend label definitions to
include therapy escalation, and benchmark against existing hypotension
prediction systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种恒包络（CE）波形设计，兼容CP-OFDMA框架，适用于多用户下行传输，实现了低复杂度收发器架构，并取得了接近理想情况的比特误差率性能。

Motivation: OFDM系统功率效率受高包络波动限制，现有高效波形与CP-OFDMA框架不兼容，无法有效用于多用户下行传输。

Method: 提出了一种恒包络（CE）波形设计，开发了CP-OFDMA兼容波形实现结构，设计了优化的CE约束脉冲整形滤波器，优化了时域二元导频序列以解决CE调制引起的信道估计挑战，提出了一种结合延迟域去噪和功率延迟分布估计的多阶段方法，设计了低复杂度MIMO LMMSE均衡器，并开发了一种多用户下行CE传输方案。

Conclusion: 所提出的CE波形设计方案在保持CP-OFDMA框架兼容性的同时，有效解决了OFDM系统的功率效率问题，并为多用户下行传输提供了低复杂度、高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: OFDM is widely adopted in modern wireless communication systems, but its
power efficiency is limited by high envelope fluctuations. Although various
high power-efficiency waveforms have been proposed, most are incompatible with
the CP-OFDMA framework and remain ineffective in multi-user downlink
transmissions. To address this issue, we propose a constant-envelope (CE)
waveform design, which enables low-complexity transceiver architectures while
maintaining full compatibility with the prevailing CP-OFDMA framework.
Specifically, we start from a general CE FDMA signal model and develop a
CP-OFDMA-compatible waveform implementation structure, followed by the design
of an optimized CE-constrained pulse-shaping filter to suppress out-of-band
emissions. To tackle channel estimation challenge under non-flat
frequency-domain pilots induced by CE modulation, we optimize the time-domain
binary pilot sequence to achieve frequency-domain CE properties, and then
propose a multi-stage method combining delay-domain denoising with power delay
profile estimation to facilitate reduced-dimension LMMSE estimation.
Subsequently, we design a low-complexity maximum ratio combining-aided LMMSE
equalizer by exploiting the periodicity and conjugate symmetry of the CE
received signals. To mitigate the downlink peak-to-average power ratio increase
caused by FDMA, we further develop a multi-user downlink CE transmission scheme
including multiple access mechanism, downlink control information design, and
corresponding system-level implementation, which ensures compatibility with the
New Radio standard. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme
achieves bit error rate performance close to the ideal case while significantly
reducing transceiver complexity compared to existing CE waveform solutions.

Abstract: Time division duplexing (TDD) has become the dominant duplexing mode in 5G
and beyond due to its ability to exploit channel reciprocity for efficient
downlink channel state information (CSI) acquisition. However, channel aging
caused by user mobility and processing delays degrades the accuracy of CSI,
leading to suboptimal link adaptation and loss of performance. To address this
issue, we propose a learning-based CSI prediction framework that leverages
temporal correlations in wireless channels to forecast future signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) values. The prediction operates in the
effective SINR domain, obtained via exponential effective SINR mapping (EESM),
ensuring full compatibility with existing 5G standards without requiring
continuous pilot signaling. Two models are considered: a fully connected deep
neural network (DNN) and an long short-term memory (LSTM)-based network. The
simulation results show that the LSTM predictor achieves an improvement of up
to 2 dB in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and a gain of up to 1.2 Mbps
throughput over a baseline without prediction under moderate Doppler
conditions. These results confirm the potential of lightweight AI-based CSI
prediction to effectively mitigate channel aging and enhance link adaptation in
TDD 5G systems.

Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, implementing
AI-based techniques to improve wireless transceivers becomes an emerging
research topic. Within this context, AI-based channel characterization and
estimation become the focus since these methods have not been solved by
traditional methods very well and have become the bottleneck of transceiver
efficiency in large-scale orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
systems. Specifically, by formulating channel estimation as a generative AI
problem, generative AI methods such as diffusion models (DMs) can efficiently
deal with rough initial estimations and have great potential to cooperate with
traditional signal processing methods. This paper focuses on the transceiver
design of OFDM systems based on DMs, provides an illustration of the potential
of DMs in wireless transceivers, and points out the related research directions
brought by DMs. We also provide a proof-of-concept case study of further
adapting DMs for better wireless receiver performance.

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: In multi-temporal InSAR, phase linking refers to the estimation of a
single-reference interferometric phase history from the information contained
in the coherence matrix of a distributed scatterer. Since the phase information
in the coherence matrix is typically inconsistent, the extent to which the
estimated phase history captures it must be assessed to exclude unreliable
pixels from further processing. We introduce three quality criteria in the form
of coefficients, for threshold-based pixel selection: a coefficient based on
closure phase that quantifies the internal consistency of the phase information
in the coherence matrix; a goodness-of-fit coefficient that quantifies how well
a resulting phase history estimate approximates the phase information according
to the characteristic optimization model of a given phase linking method; and
an ambiguity coefficient that compares the goodness of fit of the original
estimate with that of an orthogonal alternative. We formulate the phase linking
methods and these criteria within a unified mathematical framework and discuss
computational and algorithmic aspects. Unlike existing goodness-of-fit
indicators, the proposed coefficients are normalized to the unit interval with
explicit noise-floor correction, improving interpretability across stacks of
different size. Experiments on TerraSAR-X data over Visp, Switzerland, indicate
that the closure phase coefficient effectively pre-screens stable areas, the
goodness-of-fit coefficient aligns with and systematically generalizes
established quality indicators, and the ambiguity coefficient flags solutions
that fit well but are unstable. Together, the coefficients enable systematic
pixel selection and quality control in the interferometric processing of
distributed scatterers.

Abstract: 6G wireless networks are poised to seamlessly integrate communication,
computing, localization, and sensing functionalities, ensuring high reliability
and trustworthiness. This paper introduces Smart Sensing Feedback (SSF), a
limited-feedback framework designed to enhance sensing capabilities while
maintaining communication performance. SSF adapts the concept of retransmission
from communication to sensing. Specifically, we focus on downlink (DL) bistatic
sensing, where the User Equipment (UE) performs measurements from reflected
sensing signals and provides feedback to the network (NW). In sensing services,
UE reporting can vary significantly due to dynamic factors such as target
characteristics, environmental conditions, and UE status. Our results
demonstrate that SSF significantly improves sensing quality while preserving
communication efficiency. Additionally, it enhances key performance metrics
such as probability of detection, latency, and power consumption. These
improvements underscore SSF's ability to deliver robust, low-overhead feedback
and adaptability to support a wide range of ISAC applications.

Abstract: Digital metasurfaces have attracted significant attention in recent years due
to their ability to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves for secure sensing
and communication. However, most reported metasurfaces operate at relatively
high frequencies, primarily due to the constraints imposed by the physical
scale of the dielectric substrate, thus limiting their full-wave system
applications. In this work, a wideband digital reflective metasurface is
presented for capable of dynamically controlling EM waves, with multifunctional
applications in the lower-frequency S-band. The metasurface is composed of
electronically reconfigurable meta-atoms with wideband characteristics, and
designed by using trapezoidal and M-shaped patches connected by a pin diode.
Simulation results show that the proposed digital metasurface could achieve
wideband 1-bit phase quantization with a stable phase difference within 180
degree +/- 25 degree and small reflection loss below 0.6 dB from 2.72 to 3.25
GHz. To validate the proposed design, a 20x20-unit metasurface array was
designed, simulated and fabricated. By dynamically adjusting the coding
sequence, the metasurface could enable multi-mode orbital angular momentum
(OAM) beam generation, dynamic beam scanning, and precise direction finding.
These capabilities support secure sensing and secure communications through
high-resolution target detection and anti-jamming beam steering, as well as
physical-layer security. The proposed wideband metasurface may serve as an
effective candidate for enhancing spectral efficiency and security performance
in radar and wireless systems.
