*Yi Hu,Zheyuan Cheng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种集成生成模型、滑动窗口和决策融合的新框架，用于从同步相量数据中可靠地检测和分类电力系统事件。该方法通过对正常运行条件进行建模，并利用重建和判别器误差作为异常指标，能够识别已知事件并将未知干扰归类为新类别，在实验中取得了最先进的准确性。

Abstract: Reliable detection and classification of power system events are critical for
maintaining grid stability and situational awareness. Existing approaches often
depend on limited labeled datasets, which restricts their ability to generalize
to rare or unseen disturbances. This paper proposes a novel framework that
integrates generative modeling, sliding-window temporal processing, and
decision fusion to achieve robust event detection and classification using
synchrophasor data. A variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network is
employed to model normal operating conditions, where both reconstruction error
and discriminator error are extracted as anomaly indicators. Two complementary
decision strategies are developed: a threshold-based rule for computational
efficiency and a convex hull-based method for robustness under complex error
distributions. These features are organized into spatiotemporal detection and
classification matrices through a sliding-window mechanism, and an
identification and decision fusion stage integrates the outputs across PMUs.
This design enables the framework to identify known events while systematically
classifying previously unseen disturbances into a new category, addressing a
key limitation of supervised classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art accuracy, surpassing machine learning, deep learning, and
envelope-based baselines. The ability to recognize unknown events further
highlights the adaptability and practical value of the proposed approach for
wide-area event analysis in modern power systems.

*Jianheng Zhou,Chenyu Liu,Jinan Zhou,Yi Ding,Yang Liu,Haoran Luo,Ziyu Jia,Xinliang Zhou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 利用多模态大模型对睡眠多导图（PSG）信号进行图像化处理，实现无需领域专业知识的睡眠分期，并超越现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动睡眠分期方法依赖于复杂的PSG信号特征提取和领域特定的模型，这些方法缺乏直观性且需要大量专业数据集。本研究旨在克服这些限制，提出一种新的睡眠分期范式，利用大型多模态通用模型来模拟临床诊断实践。

Method: 将原始的一维PSG时间序列数据转换为直观的二维波形图像，然后对多模态大模型进行微调，使其从这些图像表示中学习。

Result: 实验证明，该方法能够使通用模型在没有先验睡眠数据知识的情况下获得强大的分期能力，并且其学习到的机制能够模仿人类专家通过PSG图像进行睡眠分期的视觉诊断工作流程。所提出的方法在准确性和鲁棒性方面持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法通过将PSG信号转化为图像并利用多模态大模型进行微调，有效解决了现有睡眠分期方法的局限性，提高了分期的准确性和鲁棒性，显示出在医学应用中的效率和实际价值。

Abstract: Sleep staging is essential for diagnosing sleep disorders and assessing
neurological health. Existing automatic methods typically extract features from
complex polysomnography (PSG) signals and train domain-specific models, which
often lack intuitiveness and require large, specialized datasets. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm for sleep staging that leverages
large multimodal general-purpose models to emulate clinical diagnostic
practices. Specifically, we convert raw one-dimensional PSG time-series into
intuitive two-dimensional waveform images and then fine-tune a multimodal large
model to learn from these representations. Experiments on three public datasets
(ISRUC, MASS, SHHS) demonstrate that our approach enables general-purpose
models, without prior exposure to sleep data, to acquire robust staging
capabilities. Moreover, explanation analysis reveals our model learned to mimic
the visual diagnostic workflow of human experts for sleep staging by PSG
images. The proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in accuracy and robustness, highlighting its efficiency and practical value for
medical applications. The code for the signal-to-image pipeline and the PSG
image dataset will be released.

### [3] [Scalable Wi-Fi RSS-Based Indoor Localization via Automatic Vision-Assisted Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22869)
*Abdulkadir Bilge,Erdem Ergen,Burak Soner,Sinem Coleri*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种轻量级框架，利用摄像头辅助自动收集Wi-Fi信号强度（RSS）与位置的同步数据，以解决室内定位中标签数据获取成本高和隐私问题。该框架通过一次性的摄像头标定和设备在摄像头视野内移动来收集数据，可用于训练定位算法，并量化了影响数据收集精度的因素，最终验证了该框架在提高定位准确性和泛化能力方面的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wi-Fi定位技术在室内定位服务中具有潜力，但基于RSS的方法对环境变化敏感，而监督学习方法需要大量标注数据。因此，需要一种能够自动收集高质量RSS-位置数据并解决隐私问题的方法。

Method: 提出一个轻量级框架，使用摄像头和ArUco标记进行标定，然后由摄像头跟踪设备，收集该设备在不同Wi-Fi信道上接收到的附近接入点的RSS数据，形成(x, y, RSS)数据集，用于自动训练定位算法。

Result: 量化了摄像头辅助RSS数据收集在跟踪精度和标签同步方面的精度限制。使用收集到的实验数据，在不同信号条件和设备类型下，对比了传统和监督学习方法的定位精度，证明了所提出框架在提高准确性和泛化能力方面的效用。

Conclusion: 所提出的摄像头辅助框架能够自动收集高质量、高分辨率的同步RSS-位置数据，解决了现有方法在数据获取成本和隐私方面的痛点，并可用于训练出具有更高准确性和泛化能力的移动端定位算法，具有实际应用价值。所有代码、工具和数据集均开源。

Abstract: Wi-Fi-based positioning promises a scalable and privacy-preserving solution
for location-based services in indoor environments such as malls, airports, and
campuses. RSS-based methods are widely deployable as RSS data is available on
all Wi-Fi-capable devices, but RSS is highly sensitive to multipath, channel
variations, and receiver characteristics. While supervised learning methods
offer improved robustness, they require large amounts of labeled data, which is
often costly to obtain. We introduce a lightweight framework that solves this
by automating high-resolution synchronized RSS-location data collection using a
short, camera-assisted calibration phase. An overhead camera is calibrated only
once with ArUco markers and then tracks a device collecting RSS data from
broadcast packets of nearby access points across Wi-Fi channels. The resulting
(x, y, RSS) dataset is used to automatically train mobile-deployable
localization algorithms, avoiding the privacy concerns of continuous video
monitoring. We quantify the accuracy limits of such vision-assisted RSS data
collection under key factors such as tracking precision and label
synchronization. Using the collected experimental data, we benchmark
traditional and supervised learning approaches under varying signal conditions
and device types, demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization,
validating the utility of the proposed framework for practical use. All code,
tools, and datasets are released as open source.

### [4] [Time-Frequency Analysis of Non-Uniformly Sampled Signals via Sample Density Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22891)
*Ashwini Kulkarni,Santosh Nannuru*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为非均匀Stockwell变换（NUST）的新时频分析方法，可以直接处理非均匀采样数据，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的非平稳信号分析方法在处理非均匀采样数据时存在不足，例如Lomb-Scargle方法对瞬时信号不敏感，而其他时频方法则依赖于固定窗口或插值，这在非均匀数据上效果不佳。

Method: 提出一种新的时频分析框架NUST，该框架采用局部密度自适应谱分析，并使用一个双重自适应窗口，该窗口的宽度可以根据频率和局部数据密度进行调整，从而直接应用于非均匀采样数据。

Result: 在合成信号和HD 10180的实际数据分析中，NUST展现了优于GLS的时间局部化性能，并成功区分了行星信号和恒星活动。

Conclusion: NUST是一种有效处理非均匀采样数据的时频分析方法，能够同时捕捉瞬态和持久信号的特征。

Abstract: The analysis of non-stationary signals in non-uniformly sampled data is a
challenging task. Time-integrated methods, such as the generalised Lomb-Scargle
(GLS) periodogram, provide a robust statistical assessment of persistent
periodicities but are insensitive to transient events. Conversely, existing
time-frequency methods often rely on fixed-duration windows or interpolation,
which can be suboptimal for non-uniform data. We introduce the non-uniform
Stockwell-transform (NUST), a time-frequency framework that applies a localized
density adaptive spectral analysis directly to non-uniformly sampled data. NUST
employs a doubly adaptive window that adjusts its width based on both frequency
and local data density, providing detailed time-frequency information for both
transient and persistent signals. We validate the NUST on numerous
non-uniformly sampled synthetic signals, demonstrating its superior
time-localization performance compared to GLS. Furthermore, we apply NUST to
HARPS radial velocity data of the multi-planetary system HD 10180, successfully
distinguishing coherent planetary signals from stellar activity.

### [5] [Resource Allocation in Cooperative Mid-band/THz Networks in the Presence of Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23065)
*Mohammad Amin Saeidi,Hina Tabassum*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种综合框架，用于研究和优化多频段网络（MBN）的下行链路性能，特别关注上中频段（UMB）和太赫兹（THz）频率。通过联合优化用户关联和混合波束成形，以及考虑切换（HO）感知的资源分配，旨在最大化系统总速率并满足服务质量（QoS）约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了应对和优化在UMB和THz频段上运行的多频段网络（MBN）的下行链路性能，该研究提出了一个综合框架。

Method: 首先，研究人员开发了一种联合用户关联和混合波束成形优化方法，以最大化系统总速率，并提出了一种利用分数规划（FP）和Majorization-Minimization技术（MM）的迭代算法来解决非凸优化问题。其次，研究了合作UMB/THz MBN中移动用户的切换（HO）感知资源分配，提出了两种方法：一种是最大化HO感知系统总速率，另一种是联合最大化系统总速率和最小化HO总数。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提出的合作UMB/THz MBN优于独立的THz网络，并且精确的近场建模对于极大规模天线阵列至关重要。此外，所提出的HO感知资源分配方法能够有效减轻HO的影响，从而提升系统性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的综合框架和优化算法能够有效地提升合作多频段网络（MBN）的性能，特别是在UMB和THz频段的协同下。HO感知资源分配策略对于移动用户至关重要，能够显著改善通信的稳定性和效率。

Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive framework to investigate and optimize the
downlink performance of cooperative multi-band networks (MBNs) operating on
upper mid-band (UMB) and terahertz (THz) frequencies, where base stations (BSs)
in each band cooperatively serve users. The framework captures sophisticated
features such as near-field channel modeling, fully and partially connected
antenna architectures, and users' mobility. First, we consider joint user
association and hybrid beamforming optimization to maximize the system
sum-rate, subject to power constraints, maximum cluster size of cooperating
BSs, and users' quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. By leveraging fractional
programming FP and majorization-minimization techniques, an iterative algorithm
is proposed to solve the non-convex optimization problem. We then consider
handover (HO)-aware resource allocation for moving users in a cooperative
UMB/THz MBN. Two HO-aware resource allocation methods are proposed. The first
method focuses on maximizing the HO-aware system sum-rate subject to HO-aware
QoS constraints. Using Jensen's inequality and properties of logarithmic
functions, the non-convex optimization problem is tightly approximated with a
convex one and solved. The second method addresses a multi-objective
optimization problem to maximize the system sum-rate, while minimizing the
total number of HOs. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
algorithms, cooperative UMB/THz MBN over stand-alone THz networks, as well as
the critical importance of accurate near-field modeling in extremely large
antenna arrays. Moreover, the proposed HO-aware resource allocation methods
effectively mitigate the impact of HOs, enhancing performance in the considered
system.

### [6] [Dual-Function Beam Pattern Design for Multi-Target ISAC Systems: A Decoupled Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23302)
*Wilson de Souza Junior,Taufik Abrao,Amine Mezghani,Ekram Hossain*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种用于单站多用户、多目标集成传感与通信（ISAC）系统的波束设计方法，旨在解决通信需求增加时传感精度下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在集成传感与通信（ISAC）系统中，通信和传感任务在资源分配上存在固有冲突。随着通信需求的增长，波束模式的改变可能导致到达角（DoA）传感精度的下降（以均方误差MSE及其克拉美-罗下界CRLB衡量）。传统联合优化方法往往忽视了这种权衡。

Method: 提出了一种将传感问题分解为两个子问题（SPs）的方法，以更有效地利用波束模式的物理特性，并将其命名为传感引导通信双函数（SGCDF）波束设计。此外，还开发了一种利用黎曼流形优化（RMO）和凸闭集投影的低复杂度扩展方法。

Result: 仿真结果表明，与传统的联合优化策略相比，所提出的SGCDF方法通过保持波束模式，提高了多目标估计精度。而低复杂度版本则在性能和复杂度之间取得了良好的权衡，以显著降低的计算成本维持了高精度。

Conclusion: 所提出的SGCDF波束设计方法及其低复杂度扩展能够有效解决ISAC系统中的传感与通信资源冲突问题，提高多目标估计精度，并在计算效率方面表现出色。

Abstract: We investigate the beampattern design problem for mono-static multi-user (MU)
multi-point-target integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where a
dual-function multiple-input multiple-output (DF-MIMO) base station (BS)
performs downlink communication and radar sensing simultaneously. In ISAC
systems, sensing and communication inherently compete for resources. As
communication demand increases, the beam pattern is reshaped, which might
degrade the direction of arrival (DoA) sensing accuracy, measured in terms of
mean-squared error (MSE) and lower-bounded by the Cramer-Rao lower bound
(CRLB). Since conventional joint formulations of the sensing-based problem
often overlook this trade-off, our work addresses it by decomposing the
sensing-based problem into two subproblems (SPs). This decomposition enables a
more effective exploitation of the beam pattern's physical properties, which we
refer to as the Sensing-Guided Communication Dual-Function (SGCDF) beam pattern
design. We further develop a low-complexity extension using the Riemannian
Manifold Optimization (RMO) and convex closed-set projection. Simulation
results confirm that the proposed method improves multi-target estimation
accuracy, compared to traditional joint optimization strategies, by preserving
the beam pattern, while the low-complexity version offers an excellent
performance-complexity tradeoff, maintaining high accuracy with significantly
reduced computational cost.

### [7] [HoloTrace: a Location Privacy Preservation Solution for mmWave MIMO-OFDM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23444)
*Lorenzo Italiano,Alireza Pourafzal,Hui Chen,Mattia Brambilla,Gonzalo Seco-Granados,Monica Nicoli,Henk Wymeersch*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 6G网络中的定位隐私问题可以通过用户端的信号干扰来解决，HoloTrace框架通过干扰到达角、离开角和到达时间差等参数，在不改变协议或网络端支持的情况下，实现用户伪装定位，从而保护用户隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络虽然带来了更强的定位能力，但也引发了对物理层定位隐私的担忧。

Method: HoloTrace框架通过用户端干扰定位相关的信号特征（如到达角、离开角、到达时间差），并将其形式化为一个统一的、秩约束的投影问题，在不同信道状态信息（CSI）的条件下提供了闭式解。

Result: HoloTrace能够成功欺骗基站，造成显著的定位误差，同时对链路容量的影响取决于伪装的位置。

Conclusion: HoloTrace为6G网络提供了一种实用且鲁棒的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: The technological innovation towards 6G cellular networks introduces
unprecedented capabilities for user equipment (UE) localization, but it also
raises serious concerns about physical layer location privacy. This paper
introduces HoloTrace, a signal-level privacy preservation framework that relies
on user-side spoofing of localization-relevant features to prevent the
extraction of precise location information from the signals received by a base
station (BS) in a mmWave MIMO-OFDM system. Spoofing is performed by the user on
location parameters such as angle of arrival (AoA), angle of departure (AoD),
and time difference of arrival (TDoA). Without requiring any protocol
modification nor network-side support, our method strategically perturbs pilot
transmissions to prevent a BS from performing non-consensual UE localization.
The methodology allows the UE to spoof its position, keeping the precoder
unchanged. We formulate spoofing as a unified rank-constrained projection
problem, and provide closed-form solutions under varying levels of channel
state information (CSI) at the UE, including scenarios with and without CSI
knowledge. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach enables the UE
to deceive the BS, inducing significant localization errors, while the impact
on link capacity varies depending on the spoofed position. Our findings
establish HoloTrace as a practical and robust privacy-preserving solution for
future 6G networks.

### [8] [Theoretical framework of passive ME antenna arrays enabling in-vivo monitoring: A pathway to smart implants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23520)
*Kalpesh Jaykar,Prasanth Velvaluri,Nian X. Sun,Richard D. James*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成磁电（ME）天线的新型脑机接口（BCI）技术，通过相控阵列设计，解决了现有血管内植入设备的增益限制问题，有望实现微创神经调控和通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的脑机接口（BCI）设备（如Stentrode）存在电池和电子线路可能导致损伤或故障的风险。为了解决这个问题，需要一种新型的、无需导线连接的BCI技术。同时，现有的血管内植入设备（如ME天线）在增益方面存在限制，需要提高信号传输和接收能力。

Method: 提出了一种基于磁电（ME）天线阵列的BCI技术。通过优化天线阵列的空间排布和相位同步，利用相长干涉增强特定远场点的信号强度。开发了相应的数学模型进行仿真和优化。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的ME天线阵列在预设的远场点（理想情况下位于患者体外）能够实现高增益性能，并通过相位调控有效增强了信号传输和接收能力。

Conclusion: 集成了ME天线阵列的BCI技术能够有效解决血管内植入设备的增益限制问题，有望实现微创神经调控和通信，为治疗严重的神经系统疾病提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: A new brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, deployed through minimally
invasive surgery, is changing the way we think about treating severe
neurological conditions. The central idea is to place a device called Stentrode
in the brain's vasculature, which enables neuromodulation and helps patients
regain the ability to communicate. However, in such devices, the battery and
electronics are wired and could introduce damage or implant malfunction. In
these cases, a Stentrode integrated with magnetoelectric (ME) antennas could be
of great interest. ME antennas offer significant advantages over traditional
antennas, leveraging acoustic resonance rather than electromagnetic resonance
to achieve a size reduction of up to five orders of magnitude. In addition to
their compactness and immunity to ground-plane interference, ME antennas could
be adopted for use in vascular implants, such as coronary stents, potentially
enabling minimally invasive monitoring and communication. Despite these
advantages, a single antenna embedded in the implant may be constrained by the
limited volume of magnetostrictive material, which could result in low output
gain. To address this gain limitation, we propose using antenna arrays designed
to produce constructive interference at a designated far-field point, ideally
located outside the patient, to enhance signal transmission and receiving
capabilities. We develop a mathematical model to represent the antennas and
optimize their spatial arrangement and phase synchronization. Simulations based
on this model demonstrate promising high-gain performance at the prescribed
far-field location through phase manipulation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的可学习卷积核方法，用于在低于奈奎斯特定律的采样率下进行有限速率创新（FRI）信号重建，提高了分辨率和噪声鲁棒性，并实现了高效的硬件部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FRI重建方法依赖预定义核，限制了硬件实现和噪声下的重建精度。

Result: 与传统方法相比，自适应核在分辨率和噪声鲁棒性方面表现出显著优越性，同时降低了采样率。基于CNN的编码器降低了计算复杂度，参数更少，在资源受限的边缘设备上表现具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过引入可学习核策略，为FRI重建提供了一种鲁棒、灵活且可行的解决方案，在提高性能和实现高效硬件部署方面均取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI) sampling techniques provide efficient
frameworks for reconstructing signals with inherent sparsity at rates below
Nyquist. However, traditional FRI reconstruction methods rely heavily on
pre-defined kernels, often limiting hardware implementation and reconstruction
accuracy under noisy conditions. In this paper, we propose a robust, flexible,
and practically implementable framework for FRI reconstruction by introducing
novel learnable kernel strategies. First, we demonstrate effective
reconstruction using known, fixed kernels such as truncated Gaussian and
Gaussian pair kernels, which mitigate the requirement that the samples should
have a sum-of-exponentials (SoE) form. Next, we extend this concept by jointly
optimizing both the sampling kernel and reconstruction encoder through a
unified learning approach, yielding adaptive kernels that significantly
outperform traditional methods in resolution and noise robustness, with reduced
sampling rates. Furthermore, we propose a practical hardware realization by
representing kernels as sums of two exponential decay signals with jointly
optimized poles, facilitating compact, efficient analog implementations. Our
approach is validated experimentally through hardware implementations using a
unity-gain Sallen-Key analog filter, achieving accurate real-world signal
recovery. The developed convolutional neural network-based encoder
substantially reduces computational complexity, demonstrating competitive
performance with fewer parameters, making our method particularly suitable for
resource-constrained, edge-based deployments.

*Runze Dong,Buhong Wang,Cunqian Feng,Jiang Weng,Chen Han,Jiwei Tian*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个用于多无人机网络的集成传感与通信（ISAC）框架，通过联合优化混合波束成形、人工噪声注入和无人机轨迹，以提高安全性与频谱效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该研究成功设计了一个集成了无人机、地面基站和ISAC功能的框架，并通过提出的优化方法实现了更高的保密速率和频谱效率。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerges as a key enabler for
next-generation applications such as smart cities and autonomous systems. Its
integration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) unlocks new potentials for
reliable communication and precise sensing in dynamic aerial environments.
However, existing research predominantly treats UAVs as aerial base stations,
overlooking their role as ISAC users, and fails to leverage large-scale antenna
arrays at terrestrial base stations to enhance security and spectral
efficiency. This paper propose a secure and spectral efficient ISAC framework
for multi-UAV networks, and a two-stage optimization approach is developed to
jointly design hybrid beamforming (HBF), artificial noise (AN) injection, and
UAV trajectories. Aiming at maximizing the sum secrecy rate, the first stage
employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize digital beamformers and
trajectories, and the second stage decomposes the digital solution into analog
and digital components via low-complexity matrix factorization. Simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to
benchmark schemes.

### [11] [Expectation Propagation-Based Signal Detection for Highly Correlated MIMO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23792)
*Kabuto Arai,Takumi Yoshida,Takumi Takahashi,Koji Ishibashi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于期望传播（EP）的检测器OvEP，用于解决大规模MIMO系统中信道矩阵高度相关和病态的问题，该检测器通过部分重叠分块和LMMSE滤波器降低了复杂度并提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模MIMO系统在密集阵列部署和散射环境有限的情况下，信道矩阵高度相关且病态，严重影响了基于消息传递的检测器性能。

Method: 提出了一种重叠块划分EP（OvEP）检测器。将大规模测量向量划分为部分重叠的块，为每个块及其重叠部分设计了低复杂度的LMMSE滤波器。通过减去重叠部分的输出来组合块输出，以减轻块间相关性的不利影响。

Result: 数值模拟验证了所提算法的性能提升，其性能接近于传统的LMMSE-EP，但计算复杂度更低。

Conclusion: OvEP算法在EP框架内得到了一致推导，其不动点理论上被证明与放松的KL最小化问题的平稳点一致。该算法在保持高性能的同时降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems typically operate
in dense array deployments with limited scattering environments, leading to
highly correlated and ill-conditioned channel matrices that severely degrade
the performance of message-passing-based detectors. To tackle this issue, this
paper proposes an expectation propagation (EP)-based detector, termed
overlapping block partitioning EP (OvEP). In OvEP, the large-scale measurement
vector is partitioned into partially overlapping blocks. For each block and its
overlapping part, a low-complexity linear minimum mean square error
(LMMSE)-based filter is designed according to the partitioned structure. The
resulting LMMSE outputs are then combined to generate the input to the
denoiser. In this combining process, subtracting the overlapping-part outputs
from the block outputs effectively mitigates the adverse effects of inter-block
correlation induced by high spatial correlation. The proposed algorithm is
consistently derived within the EP framework, and its fixed point is
theoretically proven to coincide with the stationary point of a relaxed
Kullback- Leibler (KL) minimization problem. The mechanisms underlying the
theoretically predicted performance improvement are further clarified through
numerical simulations. The proposed algorithm achieves performance close to
conventional LMMSE-EP with lower computational complexity.

### [12] [Online Specific Emitter Identification via Collision-Alleviated Signal Hash](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23807)
*Hongyu Wang,Wenjia Xu,Guangzuo Li,Siyuan Wan,Yaohua Sun,Jiuniu Wang,Mugen Peng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了在线特定发射源识别（OSEI）任务，并引入了一种名为CASH的新型基于哈希的方法来解决此问题，该方法在区分已知和未知发射源方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特定发射源识别（SEI）模型难以处理来自先前未见过的发射源（新发射源）的信号，因为这些新发射源只有很少或没有先验样本，导致模型偏向于已知发射源的分布。在现实场景中，需要在线识别来自新发射源的信号。

Method: 提出了一种名为CASH（Collision-Alleviated Signal Hash）的新型基于哈希的模型，用于解决OSEI任务。CASH模型包含两个步骤：1. 在识别已知发射源阶段，使用信号编码器和已知发射源识别器来判断信号样本是否来自已知发射源，从而减轻模型对已知发射源分布的偏见。2. 在信号哈希编码阶段，在线信号哈希器为每个信号样本分配一个哈希码，以识别其特定的发射源。

Result: 在真实世界的信号数据集（ADSB和ORACLE）上进行实验表明，CASH模型能够准确地在线识别来自已知和新发射源的信号。与现有方法相比，该模型在少样本和广义零样本学习任务上的准确率分别提高了至少6.08%和8.55%。

Conclusion: 所提出的OSEI任务和CASH模型能够有效地解决在线识别新发射源信号的挑战，并在少样本和广义零样本学习方面取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) has been widely studied, aiming to
distinguish signals from different emitters given training samples from those
emitters. However, real-world scenarios often require identifying signals from
novel emitters previously unseen. Since these novel emitters only have a few or
no prior samples, existing models struggle to identify signals from novel
emitters online and tend to bias toward the distribution of seen emitters. To
address these challenges, we propose the Online Specific Emitter Identification
(OSEI) task, comprising both online \revise{few-shot and generalized zero-shot}
learning tasks. It requires constructing models using signal samples from seen
emitters and then identifying new samples from seen and novel emitters online
during inference. We propose a novel hash-based model, Collision-Alleviated
Signal Hash (CASH), providing a unified approach for addressing the OSEI task.
The CASH operates in two steps: in the seen emitters identifying step, a signal
encoder and a seen emitters identifier determine whether the signal sample is
from seen emitters, mitigating the model from biasing toward seen emitters
distribution. In the signal hash coding step, an online signal hasher assigns a
hash code to each signal sample, identifying its specific emitter. Experimental
results on real-world signal datasets (i.e., ADSB and ORACLE) demonstrate that
our method accurately identifies signals from both seen and novel emitters
online. This model outperforms existing methods by a minimum of 6.08\% and
8.55\% in accuracy for the few-shot and \revise{generalized zero-shot learning
}tasks, respectively. The code will be open-sourced at

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于系统噪声小参数展开的非线性滤波新渐近展开方法，通过求解常微分方程组计算条件期望的幂级数系数，以降低计算效率和精度之间的权衡，并捕捉条件分布的复杂特征。

Motivation: 现有方法（如高斯近似和粒子滤波器）在计算效率和精度之间存在权衡，需要一种新的方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于系统噪声小参数的渐近展开方法，将条件期望表示为噪声水平的幂级数，并求解常微分方程组来计算系数。

Result: 该方法降低了计算效率和精度之间的权衡，并且通过结合Edgeworth类型展开，能够以显著降低的计算成本捕捉条件分布的复杂特征（如多峰性）。

Conclusion: 该渐近展开方法为非线性滤波提供了一种有前景的解决方案，能够有效地处理复杂分布并提高计算效率。

Abstract: We propose a new asymptotic expansion method for nonlinear filtering, based
on a small parameter in the system noise. The conditional expectation is
expanded as a power series in the noise level, with each coefficient computed
by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. This approach mitigates
the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy inherent in
existing methods such as Gaussian approximations and particle filters.
Moreover, by incorporating an Edgeworth-type expansion, our method captures
complex features of the conditional distribution, such as multimodality, with
significantly lower computational cost than conventional filtering algorithms.

Motivation: 集成传感和通信（ISAC）是6G无线网络的一个显著特征，其主要挑战在于将传感和通信的两个不同功能集成到同一个波形中。

Method: 在宽带体制下研究ISAC波形合成，假设使用标准OFDM信号，相位用于调制通信信息，功率谱密度（PSD）用于传感性能。提出一种低复杂度、类似水 mengisi 的分配器，并具有明确的PSD平坦度（方差）约束。

Conclusion: 在宽带体制下研究ISAC波形合成，提出了一种新颖的OFDM信号设计方法，并揭示了其与OTFS波形的对偶性，同时提出了一种有效的资源分配策略，以在通信和传感之间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: In integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), a distinguishing feature of
6G wireless networks, the main challenge lies in integrating the two distinct
functions of sensing and communication within the same waveform. In this paper,
the ISAC waveform synthesis is studied in the wideband regime, since a large
bandwidth can simplify the analysis and is justified by the employment of
millimeter wave or higher frequency band. Standard orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) signaling is assumed, and the wideband analysis of
sensing is a counterpart of the existing studies on wideband communications. It
is proposed that the phase over such OFDM subcarriers is for modulating
communication messages while the power spectral density (PSD) is shaped for the
sensing performance. Beyond OFDM, we further reveal a duality between the
proposed PSD-shaping rule and the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)
waveform. Flattening the OTFS delay-axis PSD produces the same integrated
sidelobe level (ISL) reduction effect in the delay-Doppler domain as PSD
control achieves for OFDM in the frequency domain. To balance communication and
sensing performance over frequency-selective channels, we propose a
low-complexity, water-filling-like allocator with an explicit PSD-flatness
(variance) constraint. The performance of the proposed wideband ISAC scheme is
demonstrated using both numerical simulations and hardware experiments.

Abstract: Bladder pressure monitoring systems are increasingly vital in diagnosing and
managing urinary tract dysfunction. Existing solutions rely heavily on
hand-crafted features and shallow classifiers, limiting their adaptability to
complex signal dynamics. We propose a one-layer streaming transformer model for
real-time classification of bladder pressure states, operating on
wavelet-transformed representations of raw time-series data. Our model
incorporates temporal multi-head self-attention and state caching, enabling
efficient online inference with high adaptability. Trained on a dataset of 91
patients with 20,000-80,000 samples each, our method demonstrates improved
accuracy, higher energy- and latency-efficiency. Implementation considerations
for edge deployment on low-power hardware, such as edge graphical processing

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on various and unlabeled data have demonstrated
significant success in natural language and vision, but their application to
electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenged due to the signal's unique
properties. Existing brain foundation models that inherit architectures
designed for text or images lead to three limitations in pre-training: 1)
conflating time-domain waveform patterns with frequency-domain rhythmic
features in a single processing stream, 2) ignoring the critical spatial
topology of electrodes with different standards, and 3) reliance on the
inflexible, dense network to process functionally distinct EEG patterns. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Unified Neural Topological
Foundation Model (Uni-NTFM), which is designed based on neuroscience principles
to produce universal and interpretable representations. Uni-NTFM integrates
three core innovations: 1) a decoupled architecture parallelly encodes time,
frequency, and raw signal representations before performing cross-domain
feature integration; 2) a topological embedding mechanism to unify electrodes
from different international standards and generate structured input sequences
for brain regions; and 3) a Mixture-of-Experts neural Transformer that
efficiently scales model capacity by routing signal patterns to specialized
subnetworks. The largest model, Uni-NTFM$_{large}$, has a record-breaking 1.9B
parameters and was pretrained on over 28,000 hours of diverse EEG data via a
dual-domain masked reconstruction objective. Uni-NTFM significantly outperforms
existing task-specific methods and foundation models across nine distinct
downstream tasks under both linear probing and fine-tuning settings,
demonstrating a superior ability to learn universal representations of brain
activity.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), capable of dynamically controlling
wireless propagation characteristics using reflecting antenna elements, is a
promising technology for enhancing signal coverage and improving end-user
connectivity in next-generation wireless networks. This paper presents a
complete design flow of a modular RIS prototype operating at the n78 frequency
band, starting from the simulations to the prototype development and testing.
An RIS prototype includes one master and up to sixteen slave blocks, each of
which has an identical hardware structure with $8\times 8$ reflecting surface
elements and a controller board. The phase shift response of each unit element
is controlled with a PIN diode to form a $180^\circ$ phase difference between
the ON and OFF states. The measurement experiment using two RIS blocks, horn
antennas, and a vector network analyzer showed that the improvement of the
received signal power is more than $15$ dB across the n78 frequency band for a
given placement.

Abstract: The problem of recovering a mixture of spike signals convolved with distinct
point spread functions (PSFs) lying on a parametric manifold, under the
assumption that the spike locations are known, is studied. The PSF unmixing
problem is formulated as a projected non-linear least squares estimator. A
lower bound on the radius of the region of strong convexity is established in
the presence of noise as a function of the manifold coherence and Lipschitz
properties, guaranteeing convergence and stability of the optimization program.
Numerical experiments highlight the speed of decay of the PSF class in the
problem's conditioning and confirm theoretical findings. Finally, the proposed
estimator is deployed on real-world spectroscopic data from laser-induced
breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), removing the need for manual calibration and
validating the method's practical relevance.

Abstract: Wireless multi-port sensing remotely retrieves the scattering matrix of a
multi-port device under test (DUT) connected to a set of
not-directly-accessible (NDA) antennas that couple over-the-air (OTA) to a set
of accessible antennas. If (i) the OTA fixture characteristics are known, and
(ii) the number of independent measurements at the accessible antennas is
sufficient, the OTA fixture can be de-embedded to recover the DUT
characteristics. In recent prior work, we solved (i) by connecting the NDA
antennas to a specific known tunable load network (TLN). Here, we tackle (ii)
by additionally using the TLN to provide measurement diversity. The connection
between OTA fixture and TLN constitutes a programmable fixture (PF). When the
DUT characteristics cannot be identified based on a single PF realization, we
add measurement diversity with multiple PF realizations. The underlying
"multiplexed de-embedding" achieves the joint de-embedding of an ensemble of PF
realizations when a single PF realization cannot be de-embedded. We
experimentally demonstrate our concept by remotely estimating the scattering
matrix of a reciprocal, non-unitary 4-port DUT (10 complex-valued unknowns) via
a rich-scattering OTA fixture purely based on measurements of a single
transmission coefficient between two accessible antennas across 30 different PF
realizations. We systematically study the trade-off between the number of
independent measurements at the accessible antennas and the number of PF
realizations. Multiplexed de-embedding of the OTA fixture paves the path to
implementing wireless multi-port sensing with low hardware complexity in areas
like RFID and wireless bioelectronics.

Abstract: Leveraging received signal strength (RSS) measurements for indoor
localization is highly attractive due to their inherent availability in
ubiquitous wireless protocols. However, prevailing RSS-based methods often
depend on complex computational algorithms or specialized hardware, rendering
them impractical for low-cost access points. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces buffer-aided RMSProp (BARProp), a fast and memory-efficient
localization algorithm specifically designed for RSS-based tasks. The key
innovation of BARProp lies in a novel mechanism that dynamically adapts the
decay factor by monitoring the energy variations of recent gradients stored in
a buffer, thereby achieving both accelerated convergence and enhanced
stability. Furthermore, BARProp requires less than 15% of the memory used by
state-of-the-art methods. Extensive evaluations with real-world data
demonstrate that BARProp not only achieves higher localization accuracy but
also delivers at least a fourfold improvement in convergence speed compared to
existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Optimizing sensor readout schemes and integrated circuit designs for both
open-loop and closed-loop implementations requires precise modeling and
simulation strategies. This study introduces a novel two-port impedance model
to estimate the behavior of a converse Magnetoelectric (cME) sensor. This model
provides a possible framework for calculating transfer functions and simulating
magnetometer behavior in both continuous- and discrete-time simulation
environments, and it is also possibly transferable to other magnetometer types.
Common S-parameters were measured experimentally using an impedance analyzer
and converted to Z-parameters to create a transfer function for system-level
simulations. The model was validated through an analysis of output-related
noise using MATLAB and LTSpice simulations to optimize the noise of the analog
circuit parts of the system. The simulation results were compared with
experimental measurements using a Zurich Instruments lock-in amplifier and the
custom-designed low-noise printed circuit board (PCB) under model
considerations. The proposed methodology derives noise considerations and the
transfer function of a magnetometer. These are essential for readout schemes
for mixed-signal circuit design. This allows low-noise electronics to be
designed and extended to other sensor interface electronics, broadening their
applicability in high-performance magnetic sensing.

Abstract: Extensive monitoring systems generate data that is usually compressed for
network transmission. This compressed data might then be processed in the cloud
for tasks such as anomaly detection. However, compression can potentially
impair the detector's ability to distinguish between regular and irregular
patterns due to information loss. Here we extend the information-theoretic
framework introduced in [1] to simultaneously address the trade-off between the
three features on which the effectiveness of the system depends: the
effectiveness of compression, the amount of distortion it introduces, and the
distinguishability between compressed normal signals and compressed anomalous
signals. We leverage a Gaussian assumption to draw curves showing how moving on
a Pareto surface helps administer such a trade-off better than simply relying
on optimal rate-distortion compression and hoping that compressed signals can
be distinguished from each other.

Conclusion: 该研究整合了高保真电磁仿真、生成模型和AI驱动的优化，为下一代CBTC系统在复杂隧道环境中的AP部署提供了一个可扩展且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Urban railway systems increasingly rely on communication based train control
(CBTC) systems, where optimal deployment of access points (APs) in tunnels is
critical for robust wireless coverage. Traditional methods, such as empirical
model-based optimization algorithms, are hindered by excessive measurement
requirements and suboptimal solutions, while machine learning (ML) approaches
often struggle with complex tunnel environments. This paper proposes a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) driven framework that integrates parabolic wave
equation (PWE) channel modeling, conditional generative adversarial network
(cGAN) based data augmentation, and a dueling deep Q network (Dueling DQN) for
AP placement optimization. The PWE method generates high-fidelity path loss
distributions for a subset of AP positions, which are then expanded by the cGAN
to create high resolution path loss maps for all candidate positions,
significantly reducing simulation costs while maintaining physical accuracy. In
the DRL framework, the state space captures AP positions and coverage, the
action space defines AP adjustments, and the reward function encourages signal
improvement while penalizing deployment costs. The dueling DQN enhances
convergence speed and exploration exploitation balance, increasing the
likelihood of reaching optimal configurations. Comparative experiments show
that the proposed method outperforms a conventional Hooke Jeeves optimizer and
traditional DQN, delivering AP configurations with higher average received
power, better worst-case coverage, and improved computational efficiency. This
work integrates high-fidelity electromagnetic simulation, generative modeling,
and AI-driven optimization, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution for
next-generation CBTC systems in complex tunnel environments.

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a long-standing diagnostic tool. Yet
machine learning for ECG interpretation remains fragmented, often limited to
narrow tasks or datasets. Foundation models promise broader adaptability, but
their generalization across diverse ECG tasks is not well understood. We
benchmarked eight ECG foundation models on 26 clinically relevant tasks using
12 public datasets comprising 1,650 regression and classification targets.
Models were evaluated under fine-tuning and frozen settings, with scaling
analyses across dataset sizes. Results show heterogeneous performance across
domains: in the most widely studied domain, adult ECG interpretation, three
foundation models consistently outperformed strong supervised baselines. In
contrast, ECG-CPC, a compact structured state-space model pretrained on HEEDB,
dominated other categories where most foundation models failed to surpass
supervised learning. Foundation models also displayed distinct scaling
behaviors with dataset size, which are critical for small-scale clinical
applications. Overall, while foundation models show promise for adult ECG
analysis, substantial gaps remain in cardiac structure, outcome prediction, and
patient characterization. Notably, ECG-CPC's strong performance despite being
orders of magnitude smaller and consuming minimal computational resources
highlights untapped opportunities for advancing ECG foundation models.
