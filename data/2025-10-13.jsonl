Compared to conventional\nCRB, BCRB is independent of the exact values of sensing parameters and is not\nrestricted by the unbiasedness of the estimator, thus offering a practical and\ncomprehensive lower bound for evaluating sensing performance. A system where\nmultiple targets transmit uplink pilots to a single-waveguide PASS under a\ntime-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme is analyzed. For the single-target\nscenario, our analysis reveals a unique mismatch between the sensing centroid\n(i.e., the optimal PA position) and the distribution centroid (i.e., the center\nof the target's prior distribution), underscoring the necessity of dynamic PA\nrepositioning. For the multi-target scenario, two target scheduling protocols\nare proposed: 1) pinch switching (PS), which performs separate pinching\nbeamforming for each time slot, and 2) pinch multiplexing (PM), which applies a\nsingle beamforming configuration across all slots. Based on these protocols,\nboth the total power minimization problem under a BCRB threshold and the\nmin-max BCRB problem under a total power constraint are formulated. By\nleveraging Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, these problems are equivalently\nconverted into a search over PA positions and solved using an element-wise\nalgorithm. Numerical results show that i)~PASS, endowed with large-scale\nreconfigurability, can significantly enhance the sensing performance compared\nwith conventional fixed-position arrays, and ii)~PS provides more robust\nperformances than PM at the cost of higher computational complexity."}

Capturing the intra- and cross-layer interactions\namong different domains for analysis and processing calls for topological\nalgebraic descriptors capable of localizing the homologies of different\ndomains, at different scales, according to the learning task. Our first\ncontribution in this paper is to introduce the Cell MultiComplexes (CMCs),\nwhich are novel topological spaces that enable the representation of\nhigher-order interactions among interconnected cell complexes. We introduce\ncross-Laplacian operators as powerful algebraic descriptors of CMC spaces able\nto capture different topological invariants, whether global or local, at\ndifferent resolutions. Using the eigenvectors of these operators as bases for\nthe signal representation, we develop topological signal processing tools for\nsignals defined over CMCs. Then, we focus on the signal spectral representation\nand on the filtering of noisy flows observed over the cross-edges between\ndifferent layers of CMCs. We show that a local signal representation based on\ncross-Laplacians yields a better sparsity/accuracy trade-off compared to\nmonocomplex representations, which provide overcomplete representation of local\nsignals. Finally, we illustrate a topology learning strategy designed to infer\nsecond-order cross-cells between layers, with applications to brain networks\nfor encoding inter-module connectivity patterns."}

Therefore, this work investigates the\nenergy-efficient power allocation for a single-user equipment (UE) M-MIMO\ndownlink (DL) system employing OFDM with nonlinear PAs. Unlike prior works, we\nmodel wide-band transmission using a soft-limiter PA model and derive a\nclosed-form expression for the signal-to-distortion-and-noise ratio (SNDR)\nunder Rayleigh fading and Maximal Ratio Transmission (MRT) precoding. Next, the\nEnergy Efficiency (EE) function is defined considering two PA architectures and\na distorted OFDM signal. We then propose a low complexity root-finding\nalgorithm to maximize EE by transmit power adjustment. Simulation results\ndemonstrate significant EE gains over a fixed PA back-off baseline, with over\n$100\\%$ improvement under both low and high path loss.

This work introduces\na resource allocation framework that jointly optimizes transmit power assigned\nto each user and the number of active antennas, while explicitly accounting for\na nonlinear Power Amplifier (PA). We consider a downlink MU-MIMO-OFDM\ntransmission with zero forcing (ZF) precoding, Rayleigh fading channels, and\nsoft-limiter PAs, with both ideal and realistic PA architectures. In contrast\nto existing formulations, our optimization framework avoids imposing an\nexplicit transmit power constraint, since the nonlinear distortion inherently\nlimits the feasible operating region. To solve the resulting non-convex\nproblem, an alternating optimization approach is adopted that, by exploiting\nproperties of the EE function, guarantees convergence to a stationary point.\nExtensive simulations demonstrate consistent performance gains over\ndistortion-neglecting and power-only optimized baselines. In a scenario of a 5\nkm radius cell serving 60 randomly distributed users, the median EE gains over\nthe distortion-neglecting allocation reach 40% for ideal PAs and 20% for Class\nB PAs, confirming high impact of the proposed solution."}
