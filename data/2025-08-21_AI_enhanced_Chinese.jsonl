Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in\nretrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but\nalso performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and\ndomain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have\nopened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the\nmodel ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is\nmost relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate\nsuch capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce\nFinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with\nmulti-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The\nbenchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&P-100 listed firms\nand assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document\ntype among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected\ndocument. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning\nsteps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a\nquantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance.\nWe evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how\ntargeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance.\nOur benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior\nin complex, domain-specific tasks for finance.

The aim of this work is to balance\nbetween these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image\nCaptioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant\nstudies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for\nobtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are\ntransformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our\nmultifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling\nunder a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced\nstories. In addition, compared to numerous previous studies, this approach\naccelerates training time and makes our framework readily reusable and\nreproducible by anyone interested.

Structured Thought-Action Sequences for Epistemic Reasoning in LLMs", "comment": "Accepted at ICSR25", "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have\nopened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of\nautonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative\nreasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or\nknows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study\ninvestigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed\nsolution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the\nperformance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a\nstructured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct\ncategories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths\n(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative\nactions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''\nexamples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each\ndecision.

Urban\nflooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,\nthreatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making\nremains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among\ncompeting goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)\nrequires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental\nconditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies\nfrequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.\nExisting methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent\ncoordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we\nintroduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates\nknowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven\noptimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from\nmulti-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement.

Negative sampling, which selects informative\nnegative items to form negative training data, plays a crucial role in this\nprocess. Since items are often clustered in the latent space, existing negative\nsampling strategies normally oversample negative items from the dense regions.\nThis leads to homogeneous negative data and limited model expressiveness. In\nthis paper, we propose Diverse Negative Sampling (DivNS), a novel approach that\nexplicitly accounts for diversity in negative training data during the negative\nsampling process. DivNS first finds hard negative items with large preference\nscores and constructs user-specific caches that store unused but highly\ninformative negative samples. Then, its diversity-augmented sampler selects a\ndiverse subset of negative items from the cache while ensuring dissimilarity\nfrom the user's hard negatives. Finally, a synthetic negatives generator\ncombines the selected diverse negatives with hard negatives to form more\neffective training data. The resulting synthetic negatives are both informative\nand diverse, enabling recommenders to learn a broader item space and improve\ntheir generalisability. Extensive experiments on four public datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of DivNS in improving recommendation quality\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency."}

In addition, our benchmark poses a\nsignificant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input\ntokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps.

This paper explores how DLLMs' key\nmechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention -\nclash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation\nand dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding\nsteps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods;\n2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during\niteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps\nprogress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic,\nmaking overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To\naddress these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs,\nwhich incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling\n(TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with\nthe capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware\nActivation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's\ninteraction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3)\nCertainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token\nscores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight\nquantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves\nsignificant performance gains while enhancing efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLLMs\uff09\u7684PTQ\u6846\u67b6DLLMQuant\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u91cf\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3DLLMs\u5728\u5b9e\u7528\u4e2d\u53d7\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff1aTMAS\u3001IA-AQ\u548cCGQ\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5e94\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u8bbe\u8ba1DLLMQuant\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1DLLMQuant\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347DLLMs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u7f13\u91cf\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "DLLMQuant\u4e3aDLLMs\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Utilizing historical data from the Volve\n(wells PF14, PF12) and Norne (well E1H) oil fields, this study investigates the\nefficacy of various predictive algorithms-namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),\nBidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and eXtreme Gradient\nBoosting (XGBoost) - in forecasting historical oil production rates (OPR_H).\nAll the models achieved \"out-of-sample\" production forecasts for an upcoming\nfuture timeframe. Model performance was comprehensively evaluated using\ntraditional error metrics (e.g., MAE) supplemented by Forecast Bias and\nPrediction Direction Accuracy (PDA) to assess bias and trend-capturing\ncapabilities. The PI-based feature selection effectively reduced input\ndimensionality compared to conventional numerical simulation workflows.

To address these limitations, we introduce SurveyGen-I, an\nautomatic survey generation framework that combines coarse-to-fine retrieval,\nadaptive planning, and memory-guided generation. SurveyGen-I first performs\nsurvey-level retrieval to construct the initial outline and writing plan, and\nthen dynamically refines both during generation through a memory mechanism that\nstores previously written content and terminology, ensuring coherence across\nsubsections. When the system detects insufficient context, it triggers\nfine-grained subsection-level retrieval.

We introduce a\nhybrid tokenization framework that combines rule-based morphological analysis\nwith statistical subword segmentation. The method uses phonological\nnormalization, root-affix dictionaries, and a novel algorithm that balances\nmorpheme preservation with vocabulary efficiency.

Special tokens are added for whitespace and case, including an\nUPPERCASE marker to avoid vocabulary inflation from capitalization. BPE is\nintegrated for out-of-vocabulary coverage without harming morphological\ncoherence. On the TR-MMLU benchmark, the tokenizer achieves the highest Turkish\nToken Percentage (90.29\\%) and Pure Token Percentage (85.8\\%).

This gap is particularly critical given the foundational educational\nprinciple of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which emphasizes the need\nto match learning resources with Students' Cognitive Abilities (SCA). Despite\nthe importance of this alignment, there is a notable absence of comprehensive\nstudies investigating LLMs' ability to evaluate reading comprehension\ndifficulty across different student age groups, especially in the context of\nChinese language education. To fill this gap, we introduce ZPD-SCA, a novel\nbenchmark specifically designed to assess stage-level Chinese reading\ncomprehension difficulty. The benchmark is annotated by 60 Special Grade\nteachers, a group that represents the top 0.15% of all in-service teachers\nnationwide. Experimental results reveal that LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot\nlearning scenarios, with Qwen-max and GLM even falling below the probability of\nrandom guessing. When provided with in-context examples, LLMs performance\nimproves substantially, with some models achieving nearly double the accuracy\nof their zero-shot baselines. These results reveal that LLMs possess emerging\nabilities to assess reading difficulty, while also exposing limitations in\ntheir current training for educationally aligned judgment.

Hypergraph neural\nnetworks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn\nlatent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive\ntasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small\nnumber of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then\nutilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a\ncost, as the representations only capture local information and forego\nlong-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly\nincreasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also\ndegrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.\n  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture\nlong-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance.\nDespite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency\nissues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing\nhypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more\ninformation to capture long-range dependency.

In this work, we\nfocus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start\ntemperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning\nmodels as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to\nsearch for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine\nlearning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of\nexperimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The\ntree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the\nneural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a\ngradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR).

This obstacle arises from the way models\ninherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in\nspurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this,\ncurrent methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required\nto isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end\nEnergy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\\textbf{ERIS}) framework\nto enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that\neffective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also\nsemantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key\nmechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an\nenergy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance\nfor the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a\nweight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between\ndomain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their\ninterference.

In practice, designing an effective modal test campaign involves\ncomplex experimental planning, comprising a series of interdependent decisions\nthat significantly influence the final test outcome. Traditional approaches to\ntest design are typically static-focusing only on global tests without\naccounting for evolving test campaign parameters or the impact of such changes\non previously established decisions, such as sensor configurations, which have\nbeen found to significantly influence test outcomes. These rigid methodologies\noften compromise test accuracy and adaptability.

We introduce Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) as a\nformal framework in which cognition is modeled as inference over latent cycles\nin memory, rather than recomputation through gradient descent. MAI systems\nencode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling\ncontext-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive\nsystems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent\nmanifolds, guided by persistent topological memory. Through the lens of\ndelta-homology, we show that MAI provides a principled foundation for\nMountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, modeling each cortical column as a\nlocal inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states. Furthermore, we\nestablish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning:\nwhereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes\nbackward from memory.

While previous VTP models overlook the specific\ntraffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research\nuses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in\nvarying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution\nanalyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to\ntheir traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics\nand reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this\ncomprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and\nweaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability\nin terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be\nguaranteed.

Existing approaches suffer from two key\nlimitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and\ndata-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while\nlarge language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural\nlanguage interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical\nreasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose\nTransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal\nmodeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our\napproach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex\ndependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph\nattention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured\nembeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via\nreinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input\ncharacteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework\noperates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations,\ndynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and\nprojecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to\ngenerate task-specific predictions.

In this\npaper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and\nsearch-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function\nlearned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding\ndownstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement\nlearning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to\nlearn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely\neliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the\nresulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a\nheuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning\nchain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task\ngeneralization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including\nmathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our\nunified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,\nmatching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,\nour PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.\nThese results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best\nPRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex\nreasoning tasks in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "AIRL-S \u5c06 RL \u548c\u641c\u7d22\u4e24\u79cd\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u6216\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u4f4e\u6548\u7387\u6216\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u9006\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u6b63\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e2\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u53c8\u6307\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5373\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06 RL \u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u672c\u5f3a\u5927\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

This work introduces\nFedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors\nthe spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by\nassigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with\nperiodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance\nclimate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble\n(ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under\ndifferent FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent\nbaselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and\nmid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups.

In contrast to\ntheir vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant\ncomputational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and\nprocessing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce\nthese demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the\nessential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's\npredictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation\napproaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level\noptimization.

However, most\ndecision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system\nmodel that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In\nthis paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for\nincident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL:\nMisspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture\nabout the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available,\nwhich facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds.

The\nchallenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as\nin Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather\nthan point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling\nhigher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class\nof GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and\ninteractions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global\nexplanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise\nexplanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components\nand compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only,\ncapturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global\nexplanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and\ncompute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the\nmodel's overall sensitivity.

LLM inference is an online and multi-task\nservice process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM\nprocesses input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore,\nit is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power\nconsumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key\nchallenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known\nupon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and\nprocessing time, is unknown.

The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to\nmodel training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.\nHowever, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many\nof these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.\nThese limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's\ninfluence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive\nlearning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the\nsample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across\nsuccessive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we\napproximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the\nneed for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a\nsecond-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to\nthat of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved\nby computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently\napproximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the\napproximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower\napproximation error compared to existing influence estimators.

Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as\nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs\nremain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers\nappended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on\ninefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of\ncontinuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to\nselected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary\nmodels. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete\ntokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness.\nWe propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed\none-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient\ndescent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot\nencoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We\nprovide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement\nan efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs.\nOur method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to\nthree state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four\nadversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods.
