However, current\nbenchmarks for unlearning in recommender systems -- most notably CURE4Rec --\nfail to reflect real-world operational demands.

Against this background, we propose \\textbf{STRelay},\na universal \\textbf{\\underline{S}}patio\\textbf{\\underline{T}}emporal\n\\textbf{\\underline{Relay}}ing framework explicitly modeling the future\nspatiotemporal context given a human trajectory, to boost the performance of\ndifferent location prediction models. Specifically, STRelay models future\nspatiotemporal contexts in a relaying manner, which is subsequently integrated\nwith the encoded historical representation from a base location prediction\nmodel, enabling multi-task learning by simultaneously predicting the next time\ninterval, next moving distance interval, and finally the next location. We\nevaluate STRelay integrated with four state-of-the-art location prediction base\nmodels on four real-world trajectory datasets. Results demonstrate that STRelay\nconsistently improves prediction performance across all cases by\n3.19\\%-11.56\\%. Additionally, we find that the future spatiotemporal contexts\nare particularly helpful for entertainment-related locations and also for user\ngroups who prefer traveling longer distances. The performance gain on such\nnon-daily-routine activities, which often suffer from higher uncertainty, is\nindeed complementary to the base location prediction models that often excel at\nmodeling regular daily routine patterns."}

Our DGGN\nexplicitly decouples feature learning into two parallel streams: 1) a\nfine-grained representation stream, which utilizes a novel Multi-Order\nInteraction Aggregation module to capture discriminative, class-specific\nfeatures from the limited new samples. 2) a coarse-grained representation\nstream, designed to model and preserve general, class-agnostic knowledge shared\nacross all fault types.

A secondary network maps synchronized\nlow-frequency wall pressure signals into the latent space, enabling\nreconstruction of the wake flow field solely from sparse wall pressure. Once\ntrained, the model utilizes high-frequency, spatially sparse wall pressure\ninputs to generate corresponding high-frequency flow fields via the\n$p$C-$\\beta$-VAE decoder.

Model compression techniques\nare essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained\nenvironments. A prominent compression strategy is low-rank factorization via\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce model parameters by approximating\nweight matrices. However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix\nreconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's\nfunctional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing\nmethods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during\ncompression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank\nDecomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach. CALR combines a\nprimary path of SVD-compressed layers with a parallel, learnable, low-rank\ncorrective module that is explicitly trained to recover the functional residual\nerror. Our experimental evaluation on SmolLM2-135M, Qwen3-0.6B, and\nLlama-3.2-1B, demonstrates that CALR can reduce parameter counts by 26.93% to\n51.77% while retaining 59.45% to 90.42% of the original model's performance,\nconsistently outperforming LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse.

Key\nfeatures of MEENA include: (1) diverse subject coverage spanning various\neducational levels, from primary to upper secondary school, (2) rich metadata,\nincluding difficulty levels and descriptive answers, (3) original Persian data\nthat preserves cultural nuances, (4) a bilingual structure to assess\ncross-linguistic performance, and (5) a series of diverse experiments assessing\nvarious capabilities, including overall performance, the model's ability to\nattend to images, and its tendency to generate hallucinations.

Second, methods like\nNL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of\nsemi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To\nthis end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured\ntable question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the\nHierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures\ncomplex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for\nconstructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to\nguide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor\ndecomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree\noperation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate\npipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:\nforward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward\nvalidation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from\npredicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of\n764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that\nST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code\nis available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor."}

The anchor prediction is projected\ninto a latent space, where a learnable metric-window kernel scores locality and\na soft router dispatches each sample to a small set of mixture-density-network\nexperts; the experts produce a heteroscedastic correction and predictive\nvariance. We train by minimizing negative log-likelihood, and on a disjoint\ncalibration split fit a post-hoc linear map on predicted means to improve point\naccuracy.

The\napproach computes a threshold to filter out the most sparsely distributed\npoints and outliers, forms a preliminary cluster structure, and then\nreintegrates the excluded points to finalize the results. Experimental\nevaluations on diverse data sets highlight the accessibility and robust\nperformance of the method, providing an effective alternative for density-based\nclustering tasks."}

A secondary network maps synchronized\nlow-frequency wall pressure signals into the latent space, enabling\nreconstruction of the wake flow field solely from sparse wall pressure.

To increase the\ndataset size and to reduce class imbalance, an additional 12-lead ECG dataset\nwas incorporated. A user needs assessment was carried out to identify what kind\nof explanation would be preferred by medical professionals. Medical\nprofessionals indicated a preference for saliency map-based explanations over\ncounterfactual visualisations, citing clearer correspondence with ECG\ninterpretation workflows. Four SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based\napproaches: permutation importance, KernelSHAP, gradient-based methods, and\nDeep Learning Important FeaTures (DeepLIFT), were implemented and compared. The\nmodel achieved 98.3% validation accuracy on MIT-BIH but showed performance\ndegradation on the combined dataset, underscoring dataset variability\nchallenges. Permutation importance and KernelSHAP produced cluttered visual\noutputs, while gradient-based and DeepLIFT methods highlighted waveform regions\nconsistent with clinical reasoning, but with variability across samples.\nFindings emphasize the need for domain-specific XAI adaptations in ECG analysis\nand highlight saliency mapping as a more clinically intuitive approach"}

Given an incomplete\nprocess instance, predictions about the outcome, next activity, or remaining\ntime are created. This is done by powerful machine learning models, which have\nshown impressive predictive performance. However, the data-driven nature of\nthese models makes them susceptible to finding unfair, biased, or unethical\npatterns in the data. Such patterns lead to biased predictions based on\nso-called sensitive attributes, such as the gender or age of process\nparticipants. Previous work has identified this problem and offered solutions\nthat mitigate biases by removing sensitive attributes entirely from the process\ninstance. However, sensitive attributes can be used both fairly and unfairly in\nthe same process instance. For example, during a medical process, treatment\ndecisions could be based on gender, while the decision to accept a patient\nshould not be based on gender. This paper proposes a novel, model-agnostic\napproach for identifying and rectifying biased decisions in predictive business\nprocess monitoring models, even when the same sensitive attribute is used both\nfairly and unfairly. The proposed approach uses a human-in-the-loop approach to\ndifferentiate between fair and unfair decisions through simple alterations on a\ndecision tree model distilled from the original prediction model.

Recent work suggests that\nLLMs may perform planning - selecting a future target token in advance and\ngenerating intermediate tokens that lead towards it - rather than merely\nimprovising one token at a time. However, existing studies assume fixed\nplanning horizons and often focus on single prompts or narrow domains. To\ndistinguish planning from improvisation across models and tasks, we present\nformal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning and operationalize\nthem as a semi-automated annotation pipeline. We apply this pipeline to both\nbase and instruction-tuned Gemma-2-2B models on the MBPP code generation\nbenchmark and a poem generation task where Claude 3.5 Haiku was previously\nshown to plan. Our findings show that planning is not universal: unlike Haiku,\nGemma-2-2B solves the same poem generation task through improvisation, and on\nMBPP it switches between planning and improvisation across similar tasks and\neven successive token predictions. We further show that instruction tuning\nrefines existing planning behaviors in the base model rather than creating them\nfrom scratch.

The system significantly\nincreases the number of clients it can support in each communication round by\ntransmitting intermediate parameters via analog signals rather than digital\nones.

Prior works typically quantify sycophancy by\nmeasuring shifts in behavior or impacts on accuracy, but neither metric\ncharacterizes shifts in rationality, and accuracy measures can only be used in\nscenarios with a known ground truth. In this work, we utilize a Bayesian\nframework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when\npresented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and\nirrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives. In\ncomparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive\nbehavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not\nhave a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination\nof open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing\nsycophancy. We also experiment with multiple methods for eliciting probability\njudgments from LLMs. We hypothesize that probing LLMs for sycophancy will cause\ndeviations in LLMs' predicted posteriors that will lead to increased Bayesian\nerror. Our findings indicate that: 1) LLMs are not Bayesian rational, 2)\nprobing for sycophancy results in significant increases to the predicted\nposterior in favor of the steered outcome, 3) sycophancy sometimes results in\nincreased Bayesian error, and in a small number of cases actually decreases\nerror, and 4) changes in Bayesian error due to sycophancy are not strongly\ncorrelated in Brier score, suggesting that studying the impact of sycophancy on\nground truth alone does not fully capture errors in reasoning due to\nsycophancy."}

To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel genetic algorithm-based methodology for scheduling multiple deep learning\nnetworks on heterogeneous processors by partitioning the networks into multiple\nsubgraphs.

Proper scores are loss\nfunctions minimized by predicting the target distribution.

We contribute several theoretical results, that\nconnect epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, and model calibration\nwith proper scores, resulting in a general and widely applicable framework. We\nachieve this by introducing a general bias-variance decomposition for strictly\nproper scores via functional Bregman divergences. Specifically, we use the\nkernel score, a kernel-based proper score, for evaluating sample-based\ngenerative models in various domains, like image, audio, and natural language\ngeneration.

Therefore, we\nempirically substantiate the effectiveness of QueryBandits in mitigating\nhallucination via the intervention that takes the form of a query rewrite.\nInterestingly, certain static prompting strategies, which constitute a\nconsiderable number of current query rewriting literature, have a higher\ncumulative regret than the no-rewrite baseline, signifying that static rewrites\ncan worsen hallucination. Moreover, we discover that the converged per-arm\nregression feature weight vectors substantiate that there is no single rewrite\nstrategy optimal for all queries. In this context, guided rewriting via\nexploiting semantic features with QueryBandits can induce significant shifts in\noutput behavior through forward-pass mechanisms, bypassing the need for\nretraining or gradient-based adaptation."}

According to\nour experiments, the evaluation metric of Nuri accurately classifies\nhigh-impact publications with an AUROC score of 0.737. Our Manifesting Pipeline\nalso successfully reconstructs core concepts from the latest top-journal\narticles solely from their keyword sets. An LLM-based scoring system estimates\nthat this reconstruction was sound for over 85% of the cases. Finally, our\nembedding space analysis shows that outputs from Spacer are significantly more\nsimilar to leading publications compared with those from SOTA LLMs."}

For example, in\nsocial networks, where users represent nodes with textual features (name, bio)\nwhile edges indicate friendship status, OOD may stem from the distinct language\npatterns between bot and normal users. To address this gap, we introduce the\nTextTopoOOD framework for evaluating detection across diverse OOD scenarios:\n(1) attribute-level shifts via text augmentations and embedding perturbations;\n(2) structural shifts through edge rewiring and semantic connections; (3)\nthematically-guided label shifts; and (4) domain-based divisions. Furthermore,\nwe propose TNT-OOD to model the complex interplay between Text aNd Topology\nusing: 1) a novel cross-attention module to fuse local structure into\nnode-level text representations, and 2) a HyperNetwork to generate\nnode-specific transformation parameters. This aligns topological and semantic\nfeatures of ID nodes, enhancing ID/OOD distinction across structural and\ntextual shifts. Experiments on 11 datasets across four OOD scenarios\ndemonstrate the nuanced challenge of TextTopoOOD for evaluating OOD detection\nin text-rich networks."}

Recent work suggests that\nLLMs may perform planning - selecting a future target token in advance and\ngenerating intermediate tokens that lead towards it - rather than merely\nimprovising one token at a time. However, existing studies assume fixed\nplanning horizons and often focus on single prompts or narrow domains. To\ndistinguish planning from improvisation across models and tasks, we present\nformal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning and operationalize\nthem as a semi-automated annotation pipeline. We apply this pipeline to both\nbase and instruction-tuned Gemma-2-2B models on the MBPP code generation\nbenchmark and a poem generation task where Claude 3.5 Haiku was previously\nshown to plan. Our findings show that planning is not universal: unlike Haiku,\nGemma-2-2B solves the same poem generation task through improvisation, and on\nMBPP it switches between planning and improvisation across similar tasks and\neven successive token predictions. We further show that instruction tuning\nrefines existing planning behaviors in the base model rather than creating them\nfrom scratch.
