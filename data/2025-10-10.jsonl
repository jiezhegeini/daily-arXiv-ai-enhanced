In contrast to traditional rigid\nmetasurfaces, FIM is capable of morphing its surface shape to attain better\nchannel conditions. In this paper, we investigate the single-input\nsingle-output (SISO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication\nsystems aided by a transmissive FIM. In the SISO scenario, we jointly optimize\nthe FIM phase shift matrix and surface shape to maximize the end-to-end channel\ngain. First, we derive the optimal phase-shift matrix for each tentative FIM\nsurface shape to decompose the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem\ninto multiple one-dimensional subproblems. Then, we utilize the particle swarm\noptimization (PSO) algorithm and the multi-interval gradient descent (MIGD)\nmethod for updating the FIM's surface shape to maximize the channel gain. In\nthe MISO scenario, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming, the FIM\nsurface shape, and the phase shift matrix to maximize the channel gain. To\ntackle this complex problem with multiple highly coupled variables, an\nefficient alternating optimization algorithm is proposed. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that FIM significantly improves channel gain compared to\ntraditional RIS and exhibits good adaptability to multipath channels."}

Beam tracking is an essential procedure for providing\nreliable communication services in the mmWave communication system, with the\nchallenge of providing consistent and accurate tracking performance. In this\nstudy, we introduce a low-overhead beam tracking algorithm based on channel\ncharting, which significantly reduces beam scanning times during the tracking\nprocess.
