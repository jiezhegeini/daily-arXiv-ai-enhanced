Recent advancements in deep\nlearning have facilitated the integration of algorithms into AMR techniques.\nHowever, this integration typically follows a centralized approach that\nnecessitates collecting and processing all training data on high-powered\ncomputing devices, which may prove impractical for bandwidth-limited wireless\nnetworks. In response to this challenge, this study introduces two methods for\ndistributed learning-based AMR on the collaboration of multiple receivers to\nperform AMR tasks. The TeMuRAMRD 2023 dataset is employed to support this\ninvestigation, uniquely suited for multi-receiver AMR tasks. Within this\ndistributed sensing environment, multiple receivers collaborate in identifying\nmodulation types from the same RF signal, each possessing a partial perspective\nof the overall environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the\ncentralized-based AMR, with six receivers, attains an impressive accuracy rate\nof 91%, while individual receivers exhibit a notably lower accuracy, at around\n41%. Nonetheless, the two proposed decentralized learning-based AMR methods\nexhibit noteworthy enhancements. Based on consensus voting among six receivers,\nthe initial method achieves a marginally lower accuracy. It achieves this while\nsubstantially reducing the bandwidth demands to a 1/256th of the centralized\nmodel. With the second distributed method, each receiver shares its feature\nmap, subsequently aggregated by a central node.

Considering the constraints on ARIS flight energy\nconsumption, flight safety, and the transmission power of a base station (BS),\nwe jointly design the ARIS's altitude, trajectory, phase shifts, and BS\nbeamforming to maximize the system sum-rate. Due to the continuous control\nnature of ARIS flight and the strong coupling among variables, we formulate the\nproblem as a Markov decision process and adopt a soft actor-critic algorithm\nwith prioritized experience replay to learn efficient ARIS control policies.\nBased on the optimized ARIS configuration, we further employ the water-filling\nand bisection method to efficiently determine the optimal BS beamforming.\nNumerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly\noutperforms benchmarks in both convergence and communication performance,\nachieving approximately 14.4\\% improvement in sum-rate. Moreover, in comparison\nto the fixed-horizontal ARIS scheme, the proposed scheme yields more adaptive\ntrajectories and significantly mitigates performance degradation caused by ARIS\ntilting, demonstrating strong potential for practical ARIS deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u822a\u7a7a\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\uff08ARIS\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u9ad8\u5ea6\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u7ad9\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u503e\u659c\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff08UAV\uff09\u642d\u8f7d\u7684\u822a\u7a7a\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\uff08ARIS\uff09\u867d\u7136\u6bd4\u5730\u9762RIS\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u4f46\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u503e\u659c\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u5931\u914d\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b27\u62c9\u89d2\u7684ARIS\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316ARIS\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u8f6fActor-Critic\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60ARIS\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6c34\u586b\u5145\u548c\u4e8c\u5206\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ad9\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u901f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea614.4%\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86ARIS\u503e\u659c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94ARIS\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u503e\u659c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645ARIS\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The research aims to investigate\nwhat happens in the brain when we perceive visual stimuli or engage in covert\nspeech (inner speech) and enhance the decoding performance of such stimuli. The\nthesis is divided into two main sections, methodological and experimental work.\nA central concern in both sections is the large variability present in\nelectrophysiological recordings, whether it be within-subject or\nbetween-subject variability, and to a certain extent between-dataset\nvariability. In the methodological sections, we explore the potential of deep\nlearning for brain decoding. We present advancements in decoding visual stimuli\nusing linear models at the individual subject level. We then explore how deep\nlearning techniques can be employed for group decoding, introducing new methods\nto deal with between-subject variability. Finally, we also explores novel\nforecasting models of MEG data based on convolutional and Transformer-based\narchitectures. In particular, Transformer-based models demonstrate superior\ncapabilities in generating signals that closely match real brain data, thereby\nenhancing the accuracy and reliability of modelling the brain's\nelectrophysiology. In the experimental section, we present a unique dataset\ncontaining high-trial inner speech EEG, MEG, and preliminary optically pumped\nmagnetometer (OPM) data. Our aim is to investigate different types of inner\nspeech and push decoding performance by collecting a high number of trials and\nsessions from a few participants.

While prior gait\nanalysis systems based on cameras, insoles, or body-mounted sensors have\ndemonstrated effectiveness, they are often bulky and limited to offline,\npost-run analysis. Wrist-worn wearables offer a more practical and\nnon-intrusive alternative, yet enabling real-time gait recognition on such\ndevices remains challenging due to noisy Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)\nsignals, limited computing resources, and dependence on cloud connectivity.\nThis paper introduces StrikeWatch, a compact wrist-worn system that performs\nentirely on-device, real-time gait recognition using IMU signals. As a case\nstudy, we target the detection of heel versus forefoot strikes to enable\nrunners to self-correct harmful gait patterns through visual and auditory\nfeedback during running. We propose four compact DL architectures (1D-CNN,\n1D-SepCNN, LSTM, and Transformer) and optimize them for energy-efficient\ninference on two representative embedded Field-Programmable Gate Arrays\n(FPGAs): the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 and the Lattice iCE40UP5K. Using our\ncustom-built hardware prototype, we collect a labeled dataset from outdoor\nrunning sessions and evaluate all models via a fully automated deployment\npipeline. Our results reveal clear trade-offs between model complexity and\nhardware efficiency.

Omni Scale CNN (OS CNN)\naddresses this by enumerating prime sized kernels inspired by Goldbach\nconjecture to cover every scale, but its exhaustive design explodes\ncomputational cost and blocks deeper, wider models. We present Efficient\nConvolutional Omni Scale Network (EcoScale-Net), a hierarchical variant that\nretains full receptive field coverage while eliminating redundancy. At each\nstage, the maximum kernel length is capped to the scale still required after\ndown sampling, and bottleneck convolutions inserted before and after every Omni\nScale block curtail channel growth and fuse multi scale features.

Building on our previous work developing a\nsingle-lead AI-ECG mobile system for atrial fibrillation screening, this study\nevaluates its efficiency and effectiveness for opportunistic detection of WPW\nsyndrome in real-world settings. This retrospective analysis included 3,566,626\nsingle-lead ECG recordings from 87,836 individuals in China, collected using\nthe NMPA-approved portable ECG device WenXinWuYang. The AI system performance\nwas validated using cardiologist annotations and random sampling. We quantified\nAI-assisted workload reduction and compared review efficiency across\nAI-positive and user-initiated workflows. The AI system achieved 45.5%\nsensitivity and 95.9% specificity. A positive AI result indicated about 210\ntimes higher risk of confirmed WPW. Focusing on AI-selected positives reduced\nphysician workload by 99.5%, requiring only 12 reviews to confirm one WPW case,\ncompared with 909 and 875 in population-wide and user-driven approaches.

In industrial\ncyber-physical systems (CPS), the number of connected devices and systems is\nexpected to grow significantly, demanding dependable and prompt network\nservices. In this work, we present a novel scheme, Dynamic Fragmentation-MAC\n(DyFrag-MAC) that offers dynamic, differentiated channel access to the traffic\nof various priorities. DyFrag-MAC works on fragmenting the data of normal\npriority in order to support early delivery of urgent priority data. In prior\nwork, urgent priority data either had to wait for the complete transmission of\nlower-priority packets or relied on multi-channel protocols to gain access. We\ncompared the proposed fragmentation scheme with FROG-MAC and industrial\nDeterministic and Synchronous Multi-channel Extension (i-DSME). FROG-MAC\nfragmented the lower priority packets, but did not adjust the fragment size\ndynamically, whereas i-DSME utilized multiple channels and adaptive contention\nmechanisms; both protocols lack the ability to preempt ongoing lower-priority\ntransmissions.

The priority mechanisms\nembedded in Media Access Control (MAC) schemes largely govern the performance\nof WBAN in terms of reliability, delay and energy efficiency. Minimizing the\ndelay between packet generation and reception is critical for enhancing WBAN\nperformance and associated health outcomes; however, delay optimization must be\ntailored to each traffic priority. In this work, we proposed a novel\npriority-based MAC protocol, Adaptive and Dynamic Polling MAC for Prioritized\nTraffic (ADP2-MAC), designed to support heterogeneous traffic in WBANs. The\nprotocol utilizes a probabilistic approach to dynamically determine channel\npolling/listening intervals. ADP2-MAC not only identifies traffic arrival\npatterns to determine optimal polling intervals but also interrupts the\ntransmission of lower-priority data when urgent packets are expected. The\nperformance of ADP2-MAC has been compared with the MAC protocol for Variable\nData Rates (MVDR) which supports heterogeneous traffic by assigning different\ndata rates based on traffic priority.

In\nthe complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ\nparticle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the\nhidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle\nfiltering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of\nthe system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based\noptimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle\nfilters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several\nrecently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering\ndifferentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such\ndifferentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular\nPyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible\nto a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison\nbetween them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several\nexisting studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several\ncommon challenges with state space modelling."}

Grassmannian constellations enhance covertness because\nthey tend to follow a noise-like distribution. Simulations showed that\nGrassmannian signaling provides competitive bit error rates (BER) at low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes with low probability of detection at the\nunintended receiver compared to coherent schemes that use QPSK or QAM\nmodulation formats and need pilots to perform channel estimation. The results\nsuggest the practicality and security benefits of noncoherent Grassmannian\nsignaling for LPD communications due to their improved covertness and\nperformance."}
