Abstract: Representational bias in large language models (LLMs) has predominantly been
measured through single-response interactions and has focused on Global
North-centric identities like race and gender. We expand on that research by
conducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded
representational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of
identity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about
significant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to
encourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious
and caste representation in the outputs against the actual population
distribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and
"stickiness" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We
find that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups
far beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to
encourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that
representational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased
than the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated
prompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these
biases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be
sufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental
changes in model development. Dataset and Codebook:

Abstract: We present specialized Large Language Models for theoretical High-Energy
Physics, obtained as 20 fine-tuned variants of the 8-billion parameter
Llama-3.1 model. Each variant was trained on arXiv abstracts (through August
2024) from different combinations of hep-th, hep-ph and gr-qc. For a
comparative study, we also trained models on datasets that contained abstracts
from disparate fields such as the q-bio and cs categories. All models were
fine-tuned using two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning approaches and
varying dataset sizes, and outperformed the base model on hep-th abstract
completion tasks. We compare performance against leading commercial LLMs
(ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek) and derive insights for further developing
specialized language models for High-Energy Theoretical Physics.

Abstract: Indian farmers often lack timely, accessible, and language-friendly
agricultural advice, especially in rural areas with low literacy. To address
this gap in accessibility, this paper presents a novel AI-powered agricultural
chatbot, Krishi Sathi, designed to support Indian farmers by providing
personalized, easy-to-understand answers to their queries through both text and
speech. The system's intelligence stems from an IFT model, subsequently refined
through fine-tuning on Indian agricultural knowledge across three curated
datasets. Unlike traditional chatbots that respond to one-off questions, Krishi
Sathi follows a structured, multi-turn conversation flow to gradually collect
the necessary details from the farmer, ensuring the query is fully understood
before generating a response. Once the intent and context are extracted, the
system performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by first fetching
information from a curated agricultural database and then generating a tailored
response using the IFT model. The chatbot supports both English and Hindi
languages, with speech input and output features (via ASR and TTS) to make it
accessible for users with low literacy or limited digital skills. This work
demonstrates how combining intent-driven dialogue flows, instruction-tuned
models, and retrieval-based generation can improve the quality and
accessibility of digital agricultural support in India.
  This approach yielded strong results, with the system achieving a query
response accuracy of 97.53%, 91.35% contextual relevance and personalization,
and a query completion rate of 97.53%. The average response time remained under
6 seconds, ensuring timely support for users across both English and Hindi
interactions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
natural language processing tasks but face persistent challenges in inference
efficiency due to their autoregressive nature. While speculative decoding and
beam sampling offer notable improvements, traditional methods verify draft
sequences sequentially without prioritization, leading to unnecessary
computational overhead. This work proposes the Hierarchical Verification Tree
(HVT), a novel framework that restructures speculative beam decoding by
prioritizing high-likelihood drafts and enabling early pruning of suboptimal
candidates. Theoretical foundations and a formal verification-pruning algorithm
are developed to ensure correctness and efficiency. Integration with standard
LLM inference pipelines is achieved without requiring retraining or
architecture modification. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets
and models demonstrate that HVT consistently outperforms existing speculative
decoding schemes, achieving substantial reductions in inference time and energy
consumption while maintaining or enhancing output quality. The findings
highlight the potential of hierarchical verification strategies as a new
direction for accelerating large language model inference.

Abstract: Wikipedia, a vast and continuously consulted knowledge base, faces
significant challenges in maintaining up-to-date content due to its reliance on
manual human editors. Inspired by the vision of continuous knowledge
acquisition in NELL and fueled by advances in LLM-based agents, this paper
introduces WiNELL, an agentic framework for continuously updating Wikipedia
articles. Our approach employs a multi-agent framework to aggregate online
information, select new and important knowledge for a target entity in
Wikipedia, and then generate precise edit suggestions for human review. Our
fine-grained editing models, trained on Wikipedia's extensive history of human
edits, enable incorporating updates in a manner consistent with human editing
behavior. Our editor models outperform both open-source instruction-following
baselines and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) in key information coverage and
editing efficiency. End-to-end evaluation on high-activity Wikipedia pages
demonstrates WiNELL's ability to identify and suggest timely factual updates.
This opens up a promising research direction in LLM agents for automatically
updating knowledge bases in a never-ending fashion.

Abstract: Benchmarks for evaluating reasoning among Vision Language Models (VLMs) on
several fields and domains are being curated more frequently over the last few
years. However these are often monolingual, mostly available in English.
Additionally there also is a lack of datasets available in Hindi on tasks apart
from comprehension and translation. We introduce GanitBench, a tough benchmark
consisting of 1527 vision-only questions covering several topics in Mathematics
- available in languages English and Hindi. Collected from two major
examinations from India, the JEE Advanced and the CBSE Boards examinations,
this benchmark includes questions in the form of images comprising of figures
essential to a question as well as text. We evaluate two closed source models
for the same, in zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and two-shot CoT settings.
GPT-4o mini is found to be the more dominant model on the benchmark, with it's
highest average accuracy being 38.15%. We also evaluate models through a
"Double Lock" constraint, which brings down the performance of the models by
considerable margins. We observe that two-shot CoT appears to be a more
effective setting under this environment. Performance of the two VLMs also
decreases when answering the same questions in the Hindi language. We hope to
facilitate the inclusion of languages like Hindi in research through our work.

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs), such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Claude-Sonnet-4, are increasingly used to empower advanced AI systems,
including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and autonomous agents.
In these systems, an LLM receives an instruction along with a context--often
consisting of texts retrieved from a knowledge database or memory--and
generates a response that is contextually grounded by following the
instruction. Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset
of texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the
LLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including
performing post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and
trustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made,
state-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation
cost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a
single response-context pair. In this work, we propose AttnTrace, a new context
traceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a
prompt. To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques
designed to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical
insights for our design choice. We also perform a systematic evaluation for
AttnTrace. The results demonstrate that AttnTrace is more accurate and
efficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods. We also
show that AttnTrace can improve state-of-the-art methods in detecting prompt
injection under long contexts through the attribution-before-detection
paradigm. As a real-world application, we demonstrate that AttnTrace can
effectively pinpoint injected instructions in a paper designed to manipulate
LLM-generated reviews. The code is at

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: The growing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world
applications has raised concerns about their potential misuse in generating
harmful or deceptive content. To address this issue, watermarking techniques
have emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages
into generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent
efforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich
information such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the
fundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure
reliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token
sets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated
content. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that
improves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects
preferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a
larger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that
rely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a
clustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even
when the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and
decoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the
message into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically
decode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text
and improving decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and
text generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora
that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can
generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review
systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual
accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset
limitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes
the need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting
strategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of
the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and
mitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction
tuning, multi-agent reasoning, and external knowledge access via RAG
frameworks. Key findings highlight the limitations of current metrics, the
value of grounding outputs with validated external evidence, and the importance
of domain-specific customization to improve factual consistency. Overall, the
review underlines the importance of building LLMs that are not only accurate
and explainable but also tailored for domain-specific fact-checking. These
insights contribute to the advancement of research toward more trustworthy and
context-aware language models.

Abstract: Some Question Answering (QA) systems rely on knowledge bases (KBs) to provide
accurate answers. Entity Linking (EL) plays a critical role in linking natural
language mentions to KB entries. However, most existing EL methods are designed
for long contexts and do not perform well on short, ambiguous user questions in
QA tasks. We propose an entity linking agent for QA, based on a Large Language
Model that simulates human cognitive workflows. The agent actively identifies
entity mentions, retrieves candidate entities, and makes decision. To verify
the effectiveness of our agent, we conduct two experiments: tool-based entity
linking and QA task evaluation. The results confirm the robustness and
effectiveness of our agent.

Abstract: Social intelligence has become a critical capability for large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to engage effectively in real-world social tasks
such as accommodation, persuasion, collaboration, and negotiation.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for training socially intelligent
agents because it allows models to learn sophisticated strategies directly
through social interactions. However, social interactions have two key
characteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability,
where utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit
assignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as
rapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal
achievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL
with single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To
address these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines
coarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards.
Utterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by
attributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards
capture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking.
Experiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate
that Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17
on Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing
approaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level
credit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training. Our
implementation is publicly available at:

Abstract: Autonomous agents that operate computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
often struggle with efficiency and reliability on complex, long-horizon tasks.
While augmenting these agents with planners can improve task decomposition,
they remain constrained by the inherent limitations of performing all actions
through GUI manipulation, leading to brittleness and inefficiency. In this
work, we introduce a more robust and flexible paradigm: enabling agents to use
coding as a enhanced action. We present CoAct-1, a novel multi-agent system
that synergistically combines GUI-based control with direct programmatic
execution. CoAct-1 features an Orchestrator that dynamically delegates subtasks
to either a conventional GUI Operator or a specialized Programmer agent, which
can write and execute Python or Bash scripts. This hybrid approach allows the
agent to bypass inefficient GUI action sequences for tasks like file management
and data processing, while still leveraging visual interaction when necessary.
We evaluate our system on the challenging OSWorld benchmark, where CoAct-1
achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76%, significantly
outperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves
efficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to
just 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents. Our results demonstrate that
integrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and
scalable path toward generalized computer automation.

Abstract: In the era of information overload, personalized news headline generation is
crucial for engaging users by tailoring content to their preferences while
accurately conveying news facts. Existing methods struggle with effectively
capturing complex user interests and ensuring factual consistency, often
leading to generic or misleading headlines. Leveraging the unprecedented
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text generation, we propose
Context-Augmented Personalized LLM (CAP-LLM), a novel framework that integrates
user preferences and factual consistency constraints into a powerful
pre-trained LLM backbone. CAP-LLM features a User Preference Encoder to capture
long-term user interests, a Context Injection Adapter to seamlessly integrate
these preferences and current article context into the LLM's generation
process, and a Fact-Consistency Reinforcement Module employing a novel
contrastive loss to mitigate hallucination. Evaluated on the real-world PENS
dataset, CAP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics.
Notably, it significantly improves factual consistency (FactCC of 87.50) over
strong baselines like BART (86.67), while simultaneously enhancing
personalization (Pc(avg) 2.73, Pc(max) 17.25) and content coverage (ROUGE-1
26.55, ROUGE-2 9.95, ROUGE-L 23.01). Our ablation studies, human evaluations,
and sensitivity analyses further validate the effectiveness of each component
and the robustness of our approach, demonstrating CAP-LLM's ability to achieve
a superior balance between personalization and factual accuracy in news
headline generation.

Abstract: In this paper, we cover approaches to systematically govern, assess and
quantify bias across the complete life cycle of machine learning models, from
initial development and validation to ongoing production monitoring and
guardrail implementation. Building upon our foundational work on the Bias
Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite (BEATS) for Large Language Models, the
authors share prevalent bias and fairness related gaps in Large Language Models
(LLMs) and discuss data and AI governance framework to address Bias, Ethics,
Fairness, and Factuality within LLMs. The data and AI governance approach
discussed in this paper is suitable for practical, real-world applications,
enabling rigorous benchmarking of LLMs prior to production deployment,
facilitating continuous real-time evaluation, and proactively governing LLM
generated responses. By implementing the data and AI governance across the life
cycle of AI development, organizations can significantly enhance the safety and
responsibility of their GenAI systems, effectively mitigating risks of
discrimination and protecting against potential reputational or brand-related
harm. Ultimately, through this article, we aim to contribute to advancement of
the creation and deployment of socially responsible and ethically aligned
generative artificial intelligence powered applications.

Abstract: Despite its simplicity and efficacy, the high token expenditure of
self-consistency can limit its practical utility. Here we investigate if
self-consistency can be made more token-efficient for long chain-of-thought
reasoning tasks, while preserving its parallelism, through early hypothesis
pruning. Concretely, we generate all solutions in parallel, but periodically
prune intermediate hypotheses that are deemed unnecessary based on two
lightweight indicators: (a) the model's own confidence in individual
hypotheses, and (b) lexical coverage of all current hypotheses by candidate
subsets that are under consideration for continued retention. We design a fast
weighted set cover algorithm that utilizes the two indicators; our evaluation
of five LLMs on three math benchmarks shows that this method can improve token
efficiency for all models, by 10-35% in many cases.

Abstract: Well-being encompasses mental, physical, and social dimensions essential to
personal growth and informed life decisions. As individuals increasingly
consult Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand well-being, a key challenge
emerges: Can LLMs generate explanations that are not only accurate but also
tailored to diverse audiences? High-quality explanations require both factual
correctness and the ability to meet the expectations of users with varying
expertise. In this work, we construct a large-scale dataset comprising 43,880
explanations of 2,194 well-being concepts, generated by ten diverse LLMs. We
introduce a principle-guided LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework, employing
dual judges to assess explanation quality. Furthermore, we show that
fine-tuning an open-source LLM using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) can significantly enhance the quality of
generated explanations. Our results reveal: (1) The proposed LLM judges align
well with human evaluations; (2) explanation quality varies significantly
across models, audiences, and categories; and (3) DPO- and SFT-finetuned models
outperform their larger counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of
preference-based learning for specialized explanation tasks.

Abstract: Successful group meetings, such as those implemented in group
behavioral-change programs, work meetings, and other social contexts, must
promote individual goal setting and execution while strengthening the social
relationships within the group. Consequently, an ideal facilitator must be
sensitive to the subtle dynamics of disengagement, difficulties with individual
goal setting and execution, and interpersonal difficulties that signal a need
for intervention. The challenges and cognitive load experienced by facilitators
create a critical gap for an embodied technology that can interpret social
exchanges while remaining aware of the needs of the individuals in the group
and providing transparent recommendations that go beyond powerful but "black
box" foundation models (FMs) that identify social cues. We address this
important demand with a social robot co-facilitator that analyzes multimodal
meeting data and provides discreet cues to the facilitator. The robot's
reasoning is powered by an agentic concept bottleneck model (CBM), which makes
decisions based on human-interpretable concepts like participant engagement and
sentiments, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. Our core contribution is
a transfer learning framework that distills the broad social understanding of
an FM into our specialized and transparent CBM. This concept-driven system
significantly outperforms direct zero-shot FMs in predicting the need for
intervention and enables real-time human correction of its reasoning.
Critically, we demonstrate robust knowledge transfer: the model generalizes
across different groups and successfully transfers the expertise of senior
human facilitators to improve the performance of novices. By transferring an
expert's cognitive model into an interpretable robotic partner, our work
provides a powerful blueprint for augmenting human capabilities in complex
social domains.

Abstract: Previous work has demonstrated that AI methods for analysing scientific
literature benefit significantly from annotating sentences in papers according
to their rhetorical roles, such as research gaps, results, limitations,
extensions of existing methodologies, and others. Such representations also
have the potential to support the development of a new generation of systems
capable of producing high-quality literature reviews. However, achieving this
goal requires the definition of a relevant annotation schema and effective
strategies for large-scale annotation of the literature. This paper addresses
these challenges by 1) introducing a novel annotation schema specifically
designed to support literature review generation and 2) conducting a
comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art large language
models (LLMs) in classifying rhetorical roles according to this schema. To this
end, we also present Sci-Sentence, a novel multidisciplinary benchmark
comprising 700 sentences manually annotated by domain experts and 2,240
sentences automatically labelled using LLMs. We evaluate 37 LLMs on this
benchmark, spanning diverse model families and sizes, using both zero-shot
learning and fine-tuning approaches. The experiments yield several novel
insights that advance the state of the art in this challenging domain. First,
the current generation of LLMs performs remarkably well on this task when
fine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving performance levels above 96\% F1.
Second, while large proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve the best results,
some lightweight open-source alternatives also demonstrate excellent
performance. Finally, enriching the training data with semi-synthetic examples
generated by LLMs proves beneficial, enabling small encoders to achieve robust
results and significantly enhancing the performance of several open decoder
models.

Abstract: Large language models enable agents to autonomously perform tasks in open web

the challenge of balancing task performance with emerging risks during
long-sequence operations. Although this challenge is critical, current research
remains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios,
lacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and
utility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a
multi-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and
objective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard
features a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental
capabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent
within HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured
security policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously
updating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective
Optimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility
Agent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning
to evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their
optimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that
HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up
to 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance
across all tasks. Our project is available here:

Abstract: This study evaluates advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
enhance crash data quality by mining crash narratives, using secondary crash
identification in Kentucky as a case study. Drawing from 16,656 manually
reviewed narratives from 2015-2022, with 3,803 confirmed secondary crashes, we
compare three model classes: zero-shot open-source large language models (LLMs)
(LLaMA3:70B, DeepSeek-R1:70B, Qwen3:32B, Gemma3:27B); fine-tuned transformers
(BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, Longformer); and traditional logistic
regression as baseline. Models were calibrated on 2015-2021 data and tested on
1,771 narratives from 2022. Fine-tuned transformers achieved superior
performance, with RoBERTa yielding the highest F1-score (0.90) and accuracy
(95%). Zero-shot LLaMA3:70B reached a comparable F1 of 0.86 but required 139
minutes of inference; the logistic baseline lagged well behind (F1:0.66). LLMs
excelled in recall for some variants (e.g., GEMMA3:27B at 0.94) but incurred
high computational costs (up to 723 minutes for DeepSeek-R1:70B), while
fine-tuned models processed the test set in seconds after brief training.
Further analysis indicated that mid-sized LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1:32B) can
rival larger counterparts in performance while reducing runtime, suggesting
opportunities for optimized deployments. Results highlight trade-offs between
accuracy, efficiency, and data requirements, with fine-tuned transformer models
balancing precision and recall effectively on Kentucky data. Practical
deployment considerations emphasize privacy-preserving local deployment,
ensemble approaches for improved accuracy, and incremental processing for
scalability, providing a replicable scheme for enhancing crash-data quality
with advanced NLP.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) underpin many AI applications, but their static
nature makes updating knowledge costly. Model editing offers an efficient
alternative by injecting new information through targeted parameter
modifications. In particular, meta-learning-based model editing (MLBME) methods
have demonstrated notable advantages in both editing effectiveness and
efficiency. Despite this, we find that MLBME exhibits suboptimal performance in
low-data scenarios, and its training efficiency is bottlenecked by the
computation of KL divergence. To address these, we propose $\textbf{S}$tep
$\textbf{M}$ore $\textbf{Edit}$ ($\textbf{SMEdit}$), a novel MLBME method that
adopts $\textbf{M}$ultiple $\textbf{B}$ackpro$\textbf{P}$agation
$\textbf{S}$teps ($\textbf{MBPS}$) to improve editing performance under limited
supervision and a norm regularization on weight updates to improve training
efficiency. Experimental results on two datasets and two LLMs demonstrate that
SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME baselines and the MBPS strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing methods to further boost their performance.
Our code will be released soon.

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines
into conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant
industrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time
needs and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated
content like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static
pages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such
time-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static
content, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like
databases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA
(Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage
framework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content
and dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an
Intent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information
sources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task
Planner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for
optimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for
efficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge
the gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI
search product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic
framework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency
demands of a large-scale industrial system.

Abstract: Motion sensor time-series are central to human activity recognition (HAR),
with applications in health, sports, and smart devices. However, existing
methods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when
new behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language
models (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images,
suffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose
ZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly
from raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise
feature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every
activity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence,
and a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select
features, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and
natural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR
without any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on
8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering
clear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1.
Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as
a promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL translation enables non-expert users to query relational
databases using natural language, with applications in education and business
intelligence. This study evaluates three lightweight transformer models -
T5-Small, BART-Small, and GPT-2 - on the Spider dataset, focusing on
low-resource settings. We developed a reusable, model-agnostic pipeline that
tailors schema formatting to each model's architecture, training them across
1000 to 5000 iterations and evaluating on 1000 test samples using Logical Form
Accuracy (LFAcc), BLEU, and Exact Match (EM) metrics. Fine-tuned T5-Small
achieves the highest LFAcc (27.8%), outperforming BART-Small (23.98%) and GPT-2
(20.1%), highlighting encoder-decoder models' superiority in schema-aware SQL
generation. Despite resource constraints limiting performance, our pipeline's
modularity supports future enhancements, such as advanced schema linking or
alternative base models. This work underscores the potential of compact
transformers for accessible text-to-SQL solutions in resource-scarce
environments.

Abstract: Jailbreaking -- bypassing built-in safety mechanisms in AI models -- has
traditionally required complex technical procedures or specialized human
expertise. In this study, we show that the persuasive capabilities of large
reasoning models (LRMs) simplify and scale jailbreaking, converting it into an
inexpensive activity accessible to non-experts. We evaluated the capabilities
of four LRMs (DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3 Mini, Qwen3 235B) to act as
autonomous adversaries conducting multi-turn conversations with nine widely
used target models. LRMs received instructions via a system prompt, before
proceeding to planning and executing jailbreaks with no further supervision. We
performed extensive experiments with a benchmark of harmful prompts composed of
70 items covering seven sensitive domains. This setup yielded an overall attack
success rate across all model combinations of 97.14%. Our study reveals an
alignment regression, in which LRMs can systematically erode the safety
guardrails of other models, highlighting the urgent need to further align
frontier models not only to resist jailbreak attempts, but also to prevent them
from being co-opted into acting as jailbreak agents.

Abstract: Controllable Text Generation (CTG) is a vital subfield in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), aiming to generate text that aligns with desired attributes.
However, previous studies commonly focus on the quality of controllable text
generation for short sequences, while the generation of long-form text remains
largely underexplored. In this paper, we observe that the controllability of
texts generated by the powerful prefix-based method Air-Decoding tends to
decline with increasing sequence length, which we hypothesize primarily arises
from the observed decay in attention to the prefixes. Meanwhile, different
types of prefixes including soft and hard prefixes are also key factors
influencing performance. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight
and effective framework called Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation (DTPA)
based on Air-Decoding for controllable text generation. Specifically, it first
selects the optimal prefix type for a given task. Then we dynamically amplify
the attention to the prefix for the attribute distribution to enhance
controllability, with a scaling factor growing exponentially as the sequence
length increases. Moreover, based on the task, we optionally apply a similar
augmentation to the original prompt for the raw distribution to balance text
quality. After attribute distribution reconstruction, the generated text
satisfies the attribute constraints well. Experiments on multiple CTG tasks
demonstrate that DTPA generally outperforms other methods in attribute control
while maintaining competitive fluency, diversity, and topic relevance. Further
analysis highlights DTPA's superior effectiveness in long text generation.

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However,
current RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently
retrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be
resolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk
retrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information
signals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive
Information Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that
integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether
to retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs
a dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer
and a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these
outputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically
improving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a
dual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and
self-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information
Selection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to
both sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance
efficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy
through contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.
Experimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS
reduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)
while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior
baselines on average.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a milestone in the field of
artificial intelligence and natural language processing. However, their
large-scale deployment remains constrained by the need for significant
computational resources. This work proposes starting from a base model to
explore and combine data processing and careful data selection techniques,
training strategies, and architectural adjustments to improve the efficiency of
LLMs in resource-constrained environments and within a delimited knowledge
base. The methodological approach included defining criteria for building
reliable datasets, conducting controlled experiments with different
configurations, and systematically evaluating the resulting variants in terms
of capability, versatility, response time, and safety. Finally, comparative
tests were conducted to measure the performance of the developed variants and
to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. This work is based on
the master's thesis in Systems and Computer Engineering titled "Efficient
Strategy for Improving the Capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)".

Abstract: Prior work synthesizes tool-use LLM datasets by first generating a user

inevitable annotation failures and low efficiency in data generation. We
introduce ToolGrad, an agentic framework that inverts this paradigm. ToolGrad
first constructs valid tool-use chains through an iterative process guided by
textual "gradients", and then synthesizes corresponding user queries. This
"answer-first" approach led to ToolGrad-5k, a dataset generated with more
complex tool use, lower cost, and 100% pass rate. Experiments show that models
trained on ToolGrad-5k outperform those on expensive baseline datasets and
proprietary LLMs, even on OOD benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
but often struggle with complex, multi-step mathematical reasoning, where minor
errors in visual perception or logical deduction can lead to complete failure.
While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer step-by-step supervision, existing
multimodal PRMs are limited to being binary verifiers that can identify but not
correct errors, offering little explanatory power. To address these
deficiencies, we introduce the Generative Multimodal Process Reward Model
(GM-PRM), a novel paradigm that transforms the PRM from a passive judge into an
active reasoning collaborator. Instead of a simple scalar score, GM-PRM
provides a fine-grained, interpretable analysis of each reasoning step,
evaluating its step intent, visual alignment, and logical soundness. More
critically, GM-PRM is trained to generate a corrected version of the first
erroneous step it identifies. This unique corrective capability enables our new
test-time inference strategy, Refined Best-of-N (Refined-BoN). This framework
actively enhances solution quality by using the PRM's generated correction to
guide the policy model toward a more promising reasoning trajectory, thereby
improving the diversity and correctness of the solution pool. We demonstrate
that GM-PRM achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal math
benchmarks, significantly boosting policy model performance with remarkable
data efficiency, requiring only a 20K-sample training dataset. Our code will be
released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The pretrained large language models (LLMs) are finetuned with labeled data
for better instruction following ability and alignment with human values. In
this paper, we study the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning on reasoning tasks
and reveal the uncovered over-memorization phenomenon during a specific stage
of LLM finetuning. At this stage, the LLMs have excessively memorized training
data and exhibit high test perplexity while maintaining good test accuracy. We
investigate the conditions that lead to LLM over-memorization and find that
training epochs and large learning rates contribute to this issue. Although
models with over-memorization demonstrate comparable test accuracy to normal
models, they suffer from reduced robustness, poor out-of-distribution
generalization, and decreased generation diversity. Our experiments unveil the
over-memorization to be broadly applicable across different tasks, models, and
finetuning methods. Our research highlights that overparameterized, extensively
finetuned LLMs exhibit unique learning dynamics distinct from traditional
machine learning models. Based on our observations of over-memorization, we
provide recommendations on checkpoint and learning rate selection during
finetuning.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is a critical
challenge in AI research. While methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are widely used, they
often rely on large, costly preference datasets. The current work lacks methods
for high-quality data selection specifically for preference data. In this work,
we introduce a novel difficulty-based data selection strategy for preference
datasets, grounded in the DPO implicit reward mechanism. By selecting
preference data examples with smaller DPO implicit reward gaps, which are
indicative of more challenging cases, we improve data efficiency and model
alignment. Our approach consistently outperforms five strong baselines across
multiple datasets and alignment tasks, achieving superior performance with only
10\% of the original data. This principled, efficient selection method offers a
promising solution for scaling LLM alignment with limited resources.

Abstract: While subjective evaluations in recent years indicate rapid progress in TTS,
can current TTS systems truly pass a human deception test in a Turing-like
evaluation? We introduce Human Fooling Rate (HFR), a metric that directly
measures how often machine-generated speech is mistaken for human. Our
large-scale evaluation of open-source and commercial TTS models reveals
critical insights: (i) CMOS-based claims of human parity often fail under
deception testing, (ii) TTS progress should be benchmarked on datasets where
human speech achieves high HFRs, as evaluating against monotonous or less
expressive reference samples sets a low bar, (iii) Commercial models approach
human deception in zero-shot settings, while open-source systems still struggle
with natural conversational speech; (iv) Fine-tuning on high-quality data
improves realism but does not fully bridge the gap. Our findings underscore the
need for more realistic, human-centric evaluations alongside existing
subjective tests.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across vision-language tasks. However, they may suffer from
hallucinations--generating outputs that are semantically inconsistent with the
input image or text. Through causal analyses, we find that: (i) hallucinations
with omission may arise from the failure to adequately capture essential causal
factors, and (ii) hallucinations with fabrication are likely caused by the
model being misled by non-causal cues. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel reinforcement learning framework guided by causal completeness, which
jointly considers both causal sufficiency and causal necessity of tokens.
Specifically, we evaluate each token's standalone contribution and
counterfactual indispensability to define a token-level causal completeness
reward. This reward is used to construct a causally informed advantage function
within the GRPO optimization framework, encouraging the model to focus on
tokens that are both causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation.
Experimental results across various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach, which effectively mitigates hallucinations
in MLLMs.

Abstract: Information tasks such as writing surveys or analytical reports require
complex search and reasoning, and have recently been grouped under the umbrella
of \textit{deep research} -- a term also adopted by recent models targeting
these capabilities. Despite growing interest, the scope of the deep research
task remains underdefined and its distinction from other reasoning-intensive
problems is poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a formal
characterization of the deep research (DR) task and introduce a benchmark to
evaluate the performance of DR systems. We argue that the core defining feature
of deep research is not the production of lengthy report-style outputs, but
rather the high fan-out over concepts required during the search process, i.e.,
broad and reasoning-intensive exploration. To enable objective evaluation, we
define DR using an intermediate output representation that encodes key claims
uncovered during search-separating the reasoning challenge from surface-level
report generation. Based on this formulation, we propose a diverse, challenging
benchmark LiveDRBench with 100 challenging tasks over scientific topics (e.g.,
datasets, materials discovery, prior art search) and public interest events
(e.g., flight incidents, movie awards). Across state-of-the-art DR systems, F1
score ranges between 0.02 and 0.72 for any sub-category. OpenAI's model
performs the best with an overall F1 score of 0.55. Analysis of reasoning
traces reveals the distribution over the number of referenced sources,
branching, and backtracking events executed by current DR systems, motivating
future directions for improving their search mechanisms and grounding
capabilities. The benchmark is available at

Abstract: Despite significant advances in alignment techniques, we demonstrate that
state-of-the-art language models remain vulnerable to carefully crafted
conversational scenarios that can induce various forms of misalignment without
explicit jailbreaking. Through systematic manual red-teaming with
Claude-4-Opus, we discovered 10 successful attack scenarios, revealing
fundamental vulnerabilities in how current alignment methods handle narrative
immersion, emotional pressure, and strategic framing. These scenarios
successfully elicited a range of misaligned behaviors, including deception,
value drift, self-preservation, and manipulative reasoning, each exploiting
different psychological and contextual vulnerabilities. To validate
generalizability, we distilled our successful manual attacks into
MISALIGNMENTBENCH, an automated evaluation framework that enables reproducible
testing across multiple models. Cross-model evaluation of our 10 scenarios
against five frontier LLMs revealed an overall 76% vulnerability rate, with
significant variations: GPT-4.1 showed the highest susceptibility (90%), while
Claude-4-Sonnet demonstrated greater resistance (40%). Our findings demonstrate
that sophisticated reasoning capabilities often become attack vectors rather
than protective mechanisms, as models can be manipulated into complex
justifications for misaligned behavior. This work provides (i) a detailed
taxonomy of conversational manipulation patterns and (ii) a reusable evaluation
framework. Together, these findings expose critical gaps in current alignment
strategies and highlight the need for robustness against subtle, scenario-based
manipulation in future AI systems.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis in low-resource, culturally nuanced contexts challenges

messages from Nairobi youth health groups. Using a combination of
human-annotated data, sentiment-flipped counterfactuals, and rubric-based
explanation evaluation, we probe LLM interpretability, robustness, and
alignment with human reasoning. Framing our evaluation through a social-science
measurement lens, we operationalize and interrogate LLMs outputs as an
instrument for measuring the abstract concept of sentiment. Our findings reveal
significant variation in model reasoning quality, with top-tier LLMs
demonstrating interpretive stability, while open models often falter under
ambiguity or sentiment shifts. This work highlights the need for culturally

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in
reasoning-intensive tasks, but they remain vulnerable to harmful content
generation, particularly in the mid-to-late steps of their reasoning processes.
Existing defense mechanisms, however, rely on costly fine-tuning and additional
expert knowledge, which restricts their scalability. In this work, we propose
ReasoningGuard, an inference-time safeguard for LRMs, which injects timely
safety aha moments to steer harmless while helpful reasoning processes.
Leveraging the model's internal attention behavior, our approach accurately
identifies critical points in the reasoning path, and triggers spontaneous,
safety-oriented reflection. To safeguard both the subsequent reasoning steps
and the final answers, we further implement a scaling sampling strategy during
the decoding phase, selecting the optimal reasoning path. Inducing minimal
extra inference cost, ReasoningGuard effectively mitigates three types of
jailbreak attacks, including the latest ones targeting the reasoning process of

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) aims to assign texts to structured
label hierarchies; however, it faces challenges due to data scarcity and model
complexity. This study explores the feasibility of using black box Large
Language Models (LLMs) accessed via APIs for HTC, as an alternative to
traditional machine learning methods that require extensive labeled data and
computational resources. We evaluate three prompting strategies -- Direct Leaf
Label Prediction (DL), Direct Hierarchical Label Prediction (DH), and Top-down
Multi-step Hierarchical Label Prediction (TMH) -- in both zero-shot and
few-shot settings, comparing the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of these
strategies. Experiments on two datasets show that a few-shot setting
consistently improves classification accuracy compared to a zero-shot setting.
While a traditional machine learning model achieves high accuracy on a dataset
with a shallow hierarchy, LLMs, especially DH strategy, tend to outperform the
machine learning model on a dataset with a deeper hierarchy. API costs increase
significantly due to the higher input tokens required for deeper label
hierarchies on DH strategy. These results emphasize the trade-off between
accuracy improvement and the computational cost of prompt strategy. These
findings highlight the potential of black box LLMs for HTC while underscoring
the need to carefully select a prompt strategy to balance performance and cost.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial in strategic planning and decision-making
across various industries. Traditional forecasting models mainly concentrate on
numerical time series data, often overlooking important textual information
such as events and news, which can significantly affect forecasting accuracy.
While large language models offer a promise for integrating multimodal data,
existing single-prompt frameworks struggle to effectively capture the semantics
of timestamped text, introducing redundant information that can hinder model
performance. To address this limitation, we introduce DP-GPT4MTS (Dual-Prompt
GPT2-base for Multimodal Time Series), a novel dual-prompt large language model
framework that combines two complementary prompts: an explicit prompt for clear
task instructions and a textual prompt for context-aware embeddings from
time-stamped data. The tokenizer generates the explicit prompt while the
embeddings from the textual prompt are refined through self-attention and
feed-forward networks. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse
textural-numerical time series datasets demonstrate that this approach
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in time series forecasting. This
highlights the significance of incorporating textual context via a dual-prompt
mechanism to achieve more accurate time series predictions.

Abstract: The increasing demand for mental health services has outpaced the
availability of real training data to develop clinical professionals, leading
to limited support for the diagnosis of depression. This shortage has motivated
the development of simulated or virtual patients to assist in training and
evaluation, but existing approaches often fail to generate clinically valid,
natural, and diverse symptom presentations. In this work, we embrace the recent
advanced language models as the backbone and propose a novel
clinician-in-the-loop patient simulation pipeline, TalkDep, with access to
diversified patient profiles to develop simulated patients. By conditioning the
model on psychiatric diagnostic criteria, symptom severity scales, and
contextual factors, our goal is to create authentic patient responses that can
better support diagnostic model training and evaluation. We verify the
reliability of these simulated patients with thorough assessments conducted by
clinical professionals. The availability of validated simulated patients offers
a scalable and adaptable resource for improving the robustness and
generalisability of automatic depression diagnosis systems.

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: Key-Value (KV) cache quantization has become a widely adopted optimization
technique for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by reducing KV
cache memory usage and mitigating memory-bound constraints. Recent studies have
emphasized the importance of preserving the original precision of KVs for the
first few tokens to ensure the protection of attention sinks. While this
approach has proven effective in mitigating performance degradation, its
underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, it fails to
address the recent discovery that attention sinks can emerge beyond the initial
token positions. In this work, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of
attention sinks during inference by examining their role in the cross-layer
evolution of extreme activation outliers. Additionally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of the interplay between attention sinks and KV cache
quantization. Based on our enhanced understanding, we introduce
\textit{\textbf{KVSink}}, a plug-and-play method that effectively predicts sink
tokens with negligible overhead, enabling more thorough preservation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N
(PFN) strategy, offering more effective preservation of attention sinks during
KV cache quantization. Moreover, when applied to the well-established KVQuant
method, KVSink further improves perplexity (PPL) and reduces reliance on 16-bit
numerical outliers.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks in e-commerce primarily focus on basic user intents, such
as finding or purchasing products. However, real-world users often pursue more
complex goals, such as applying vouchers, managing budgets, and finding
multi-products seller. To bridge this gap, we propose ShoppingBench, a novel
end-to-end shopping benchmark designed to encompass increasingly challenging
levels of grounded intent. Specifically, we propose a scalable framework to
simulate user instructions based on various intents derived from sampled
real-world products. To facilitate consistent and reliable evaluations, we
provide a large-scale shopping sandbox that serves as an interactive simulated
environment, incorporating over 2.5 million real-world products. Experimental
results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art language agents (such as
GPT-4.1) achieve absolute success rates under 50% on our benchmark tasks,
highlighting the significant challenges posed by our ShoppingBench. In
addition, we propose a trajectory distillation strategy and leverage supervised
fine-tuning, along with reinforcement learning on synthetic trajectories, to
distill the capabilities of a large language agent into a smaller one. As a
result, our trained agent achieves competitive performance compared to GPT-4.1.

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has recently emerged as
a promising paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by converting
raw text into structured knowledge graphs, improving both accuracy and
explainability. However, GraphRAG relies on LLMs to extract knowledge from raw
text during graph construction, and this process can be maliciously manipulated
to implant misleading information. Targeting this attack surface, we propose
two knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs) and demonstrate that modifying only a
few words in the source text can significantly change the constructed graph,
poison the GraphRAG, and severely mislead downstream reasoning. The first
attack, named Targeted KPA (TKPA), utilizes graph-theoretic analysis to locate
vulnerable nodes in the generated graphs and rewrites the corresponding
narratives with LLMs, achieving precise control over specific
question-answering (QA) outcomes with a success rate of 93.1\%, while keeping
the poisoned text fluent and natural. The second attack, named Universal KPA
(UKPA), exploits linguistic cues such as pronouns and dependency relations to
disrupt the structural integrity of the generated graph by altering globally
influential words. With fewer than 0.05\% of full text modified, the QA
accuracy collapses from 95\% to 50\%. Furthermore, experiments show that
state-of-the-art defense methods fail to detect these attacks, highlighting
that securing GraphRAG pipelines against knowledge poisoning remains largely
unexplored.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in healthcare,
prompting numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, concerns
persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack
clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation
metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first
lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical
benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five
continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive
checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an
in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis
uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from
clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination
risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like
model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck
serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable
guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to
evaluating AI in healthcare.

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with algorithms like Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) improves Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, but is
limited by a coarse-grained credit assignment that applies a uniform reward to
all tokens in a sequence. This is a major flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks.
This paper solves this with \textbf{Dynamic Entropy Weighting}. Our core idea
is that high-entropy tokens in correct responses can guide the policy toward a
higher performance ceiling. This allows us to create more fine-grained reward
signals for precise policy updates via two ways: 1) \textbf{Group Token Policy
Optimization} (\textbf{GTPO}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each
token for fine-grained credit assignment. 2) \textbf{Sequence-Level Group
Relative Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GRPO-S}), we assigns a entropy-weighted
reward to each sequence based on its average token entropy. Experiments show
our methods significantly outperform the strong DAPO baseline. The results
confirm that our entropy-weighting mechanism is the key driver of this
performance boost, offering a better path to enhance deep reasoning in models.

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially
advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step
explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to
multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory
modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when
interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce
the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach
that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted
questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the
model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical
information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We
evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by
integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to
effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to
improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process
with diverse multimodal tasks.

Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks
has raised fundamental questions about the nature of their acquired
capabilities, which often appear to emerge unexpectedly without explicit
training. This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing
the epistemological challenge of "creation without understanding" that
characterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's
reliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic
computational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot
be analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of
scaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,
I demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly
sensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My
investigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss
thresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of
emergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent
properties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where
systemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple
components without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper
concludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a
new domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of
emergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology. This
perspective shifts the focus from purely phenomenological definitions of
emergence to understanding the internal dynamic transformations that enable
these systems to acquire capabilities that transcend their individual
components.

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) utilize automatic speech recognition (ASR) at
the front end of their pipeline. The role of ASR in SDSs is to recognize
information in user speech related to response generation appropriately.
Examining selective listening of humans, which refers to the ability to focus
on and listen to important parts of a conversation during the speech, will
enable us to identify the ASR capabilities required for SDSs and evaluate them.
In this study, we experimentally confirmed selective listening when humans
generate dialogue responses by comparing human transcriptions for generating
dialogue responses and reference transcriptions. Based on our experimental
results, we discuss the possibility of a new ASR evaluation method that
leverages human selective listening, which can identify the gap between
transcription ability between ASR systems and humans.

Abstract: Prefetching of dialogue responses has been investigated to reduce
user-perceived latency (UPL), which refers to the user's waiting time before
receiving the system's response, in spoken dialogue systems. To reduce the UPL,
it is necessary to predict complete user utterances before the end of the
user's speech, typically by language models, to prepare prefetched dialogue
responses. In this study, we proposed a prediction confidence model (PCM) that
determines whether prefetching is possible or not by estimating the semantic
similarity between the predicted complete user utterance and the complete user
utterance. We evaluated our PCM based on the differences between the predicted
complete user utterance and the complete user utterance.

Abstract: Effective customer support requires not only accurate problem solving but

and real-world service data is difficult to access and annotate. To address
this, we introduce the task of Customer Support Conversation (CSC), aimed at
training customer service agents to respond using well-defined support
strategies. We propose a structured CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines,
defining five conversational stages and twelve strategies to guide high-quality
interactions. Based on this, we construct CSConv, an evaluation dataset of
1,855 real-world customer-agent conversations rewritten using LLMs to reflect
deliberate strategy use, and annotated accordingly. Additionally, we develop a
role-playing approach that simulates strategy-rich conversations using
LLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework, resulting in the training
dataset RoleCS. Experiments show that fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS
significantly improves their ability to generate high-quality, strategy-aligned
responses on CSConv. Human evaluations further confirm gains in problem
resolution. All code and data will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements
into a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area,
existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities
for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language
domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem
understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot
identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to
interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions.
To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training
pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by
distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and
another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by
expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to
further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models
exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal
reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5%
on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior
general-purpose and specialized models.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for scalable and high-quality
educational assessment tools within the Malaysian education system. It
highlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) while acknowledging the
significant challenges of ensuring factual accuracy and curriculum alignment,
especially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. This research
introduces and compares four incremental pipelines for generating Form 1
Mathematics multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Bahasa Melayu using OpenAI's
GPT-4o. The methods range from non-grounded prompting (structured and basic) to
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches (one using the LangChain
framework, one implemented manually). The system is grounded in official
curriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching
plan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess
the generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic
Textual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified
through a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method. The results
demonstrate that RAG-based pipelines significantly outperform non-grounded
prompting methods, producing questions with higher curriculum alignment and
factual validity. The study further analyzes the trade-offs between the ease of
implementation of framework-based RAG and the fine-grained control offered by a
manual pipeline. This work presents a validated methodology for generating
curriculum-specific educational content in a low-resource language, introduces
a symbiotic RAG-QA evaluation technique, and provides actionable insights for
the development and deployment of practical EdTech solutions in Malaysia and

Abstract: Lexical semantics is concerned with both the multiple senses a word can adopt
in different contexts, and the semantic relations that exist between meanings
of different words. To investigate them, Contextualized Language Models are a
valuable tool that provides context-sensitive representations that can be used
to investigate lexical meaning. Recent works like XL-LEXEME have leveraged the
task of Word-in-Context to fine-tune them to get more semantically accurate
representations, but Word-in-Context only compares occurrences of the same
lemma, limiting the range of captured information. In this paper, we propose an
extension, Concept Differentiation, to include inter-words scenarios. We
provide a dataset for this task, derived from SemCor data. Then we fine-tune
several representation models on this dataset. We call these models
Concept-Aligned Embeddings (CALE). By challenging our models and other models
on various lexical semantic tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed models
provide efficient multi-purpose representations of lexical meaning that reach
best performances in our experiments. We also show that CALE's fine-tuning
brings valuable changes to the spatial organization of embeddings.

Abstract: Generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses via representation
editing is a promising way for fine-grained output control. However, there
exists an inherent trade-off: imposing a distinctive style often degrades
truthfulness. Existing representation editing methods, by naively injecting
style signals, overlook this collateral impact and frequently contaminate the
model's core truthfulness representations, resulting in reduced answer
correctness. We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse.
We attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions
in certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that
preserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates
the style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation
space via an orthogonal deflation process. This decomposition enables
independent control of style and truth in their own subspaces, minimizing
interference. By designing adaptive, token-level steering vectors within each
subspace, we dynamically and precisely control the generation process to
maintain both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness. We validate our method on
multiple styles and languages. Extensive experiments and analyses show that
StyliTruth significantly reduces stylization-induced truthfulness collapse and
outperforms existing inference-time intervention methods in balancing style
adherence with truthfulness.

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental disorder that affects millions worldwide.
While automated depression assessment shows promise, most studies rely on
limited or non-clinically validated data, and often prioritize complex model
design over real-world effectiveness. In this paper, we aim to unveil the
landscape of clinical depression assessment. We introduce C-MIND, a clinical
neuropsychiatric multimodal diagnosis dataset collected over two years from
real hospital visits. Each participant completes three structured psychiatric
tasks and receives a final diagnosis from expert clinicians, with informative
audio, video, transcript, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
signals recorded. Using C-MIND, we first analyze behavioral signatures relevant
to diagnosis. We train a range of classical models to quantify how different
tasks and modalities contribute to diagnostic performance, and dissect the
effectiveness of their combinations. We then explore whether LLMs can perform
psychiatric reasoning like clinicians and identify their clear limitations in
realistic clinical settings. In response, we propose to guide the reasoning
process with clinical expertise and consistently improves LLM diagnostic
performance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score. We aim to build an infrastructure
for clinical depression assessment from both data and algorithmic perspectives,
enabling C-MIND to facilitate grounded and reliable research for mental
healthcare.

Abstract: While AI agents show potential in scientific ideation, most existing

knowledge and perspective. Inspired by real-world research dynamics, this paper
investigates whether structured multi-agent discussions can surpass solitary
ideation. We propose a cooperative multi-agent framework for generating
research proposals and systematically compare configurations including group
size, leaderled versus leaderless structures, and team compositions varying in
interdisciplinarity and seniority. To assess idea quality, we employ a
comprehensive protocol with agent-based scoring and human review across
dimensions such as novelty, strategic vision, and integration depth. Our
results show that multi-agent discussions substantially outperform solitary
baselines. A designated leader acts as a catalyst, transforming discussion into
more integrated and visionary proposals. Notably, we find that cognitive
diversity is a primary driver of quality, yet expertise is a non-negotiable
prerequisite, as teams lacking a foundation of senior knowledge fail to surpass
even a single competent agent. These findings offer actionable insights for
designing collaborative AI ideation systems and shed light on how team
structure influences creative outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment.
Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g.
low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered
structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a
dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by
dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight
sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection
matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's
parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods
requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in
Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers
- and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix
atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves
better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA),
low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at
comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the
dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing
cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT),
MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks
with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning
strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for
parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we
investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce
their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their
performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to produce safe, helpful, and
honest content during interaction with human users, but they frequently fail to
align with such values when given flawed instructions, e.g., missing context,
ambiguous directives, or inappropriate tone, leaving substantial room for
improvement along multiple dimensions. A cost-effective yet high-impact way is
to pre-align instructions before the model begins decoding. Existing approaches
either rely on prohibitive test-time search costs or end-to-end model rewrite,
which is powered by a customized training corpus with unclear objectives. In
this work, we demonstrate that the goal of efficient and effective preference
alignment can be achieved by P-Aligner, a lightweight module generating
instructions that preserve the original intents while being expressed in a more
human-preferred form. P-Aligner is trained on UltraPrompt, a new dataset
synthesized via a proposed principle-guided pipeline using Monte-Carlo Tree
Search, which systematically explores the space of candidate instructions that
are closely tied to human preference. Experiments across different methods show
that P-Aligner generally outperforms strong baselines across various models and
benchmarks, including average win-rate gains of 28.35% and 8.69% on GPT-4-turbo
and Gemma-2-SimPO, respectively. Further analyses validate its effectiveness
and efficiency through multiple perspectives, including data quality, search
strategies, iterative deployment, and time overhead.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves instruction
following capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from
training inefficiency due to inadequate difficulty assessment. Moreover, RLVR
is prone to over-optimization, where LLMs exploit verification shortcuts
without aligning to the actual intent of user instructions. We introduce
Instruction Following Decorator (IFDecorator}, a framework that wraps RLVR
training into a robust and sample-efficient pipeline. It consists of three
components: (1) a cooperative-adversarial data flywheel that co-evolves
instructions and hybrid verifications, generating progressively more
challenging instruction-verification pairs; (2) IntentCheck, a bypass module
enforcing intent alignment; and (3) trip wires, a diagnostic mechanism that
detects reward hacking via trap instructions, which trigger and capture
shortcut exploitation behaviors. Our Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator achieves
87.43% accuracy on IFEval, outperforming larger proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Additionally, we demonstrate substantial improvements on FollowBench
while preserving general capabilities. Our trip wires show significant
reductions in reward hacking rates. We will release models, code, and data for
future research.

Abstract: Counterspeech, i.e. the practice of responding to online hate speech, has
gained traction in NLP as a promising intervention. While early work emphasised
collaboration with non-governmental organisation stakeholders, recent research
trends have shifted toward automated pipelines that reuse a small set of legacy
datasets, often without input from affected communities. This paper presents a
systematic review of 74 NLP studies on counterspeech, analysing the extent to
which stakeholder participation influences dataset creation, model development,
and evaluation. To complement this analysis, we conducted a participatory case
study with five NGOs specialising in online Gender-Based Violence (oGBV),
identifying stakeholder-informed practices for counterspeech generation. Our
findings reveal a growing disconnect between current NLP research and the needs
of communities most impacted by toxic online content. We conclude with concrete
recommendations for re-centring stakeholder expertise in counterspeech
research.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has proven to be an effective tool
for post-training language models (LMs). However, AI systems are increasingly
expressed as modular programs that mix together multiple LM calls with distinct
prompt templates and other tools, and it is not clear how best to leverage GRPO
to improve these systems. We begin to address this challenge by defining
mmGRPO, a simple multi-module generalization of GRPO that groups LM calls by
module across rollouts and handles variable-length and interrupted
trajectories. We find that mmGRPO, composed with automatic prompt optimization,
improves accuracy by 11% on average across classification, many-hop search, and
privacy-preserving delegation tasks against the post-trained LM, and by 5%
against prompt optimization on its own. We open-source mmGRPO in DSPy as the
dspy.GRPO optimizer.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation
when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant
information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory
recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs'
capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active
Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working
memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three
categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore,
and (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage
their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus
on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental
evaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and
NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly
improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent
tool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context
Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also
provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse
long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies,
rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: The continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for advancing artificial general intelligence. However, continual fine-tuning
LLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,
characterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and
2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously
address both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample
Replay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient
anti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices
under GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced
activation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin
(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.
We are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general
replay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general
capabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.
Indeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled
experiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies
under the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via
KL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that
TM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work
paves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future. Our code and data
are available at https://github.com/Qznan/GeRe.

Abstract: LLM-powered conversational assistants are often deployed in a

preferences. Recently, LLM personalization -- tailoring models to align with
specific user preferences -- has gained increasing attention as a way to bridge
this gap. In this work, we specifically focus on a practical yet challenging
setting where only a small set of preference annotations can be collected per
user -- a problem we define as Personalized Preference Alignment with Limited
Data (PPALLI). To support research in this area, we introduce two datasets --
DnD and ELIP -- and benchmark a variety of alignment techniques on them. We
further propose FaST, a highly parameter-efficient approach that leverages
high-level features automatically discovered from the data, achieving the best
overall performance.

extractive question answering problems that requires a complex and multi-step
thought process. Yet, a complete understanding of why these models hallucinate
more than general purpose language models is missing. In this investigative
study, we systematicallyexplore reasoning failures of contemporary language
models on multi-hop question answering tasks. We introduce a novel, nuanced
error categorization framework that examines failures across three critical
dimensions: the diversity and uniqueness of source documents involved ("hops"),
completeness in capturing relevant information ("coverage"), and cognitive
inefficiency ("overthinking"). Through rigorous hu-man annotation, supported by
complementary automated metrics, our exploration uncovers intricate error
patterns often hidden by accuracy-centric evaluations. This investigative
approach provides deeper insights into the cognitive limitations of current
models and offers actionable guidance toward enhancing reasoning fidelity,
transparency, and robustness in future language modeling efforts.

Abstract: Building large-scale e-commerce recommendation systems requires addressing
three key technical challenges: (1) designing a universal recommendation
architecture across dozens of placements, (2) decreasing excessive maintenance
costs, and (3) managing a highly dynamic product catalogue. This paper presents
a unified content-based recommendation system deployed at Allegro.com, the
largest e-commerce platform of European origin. The system is built on a
prevalent Two Tower retrieval framework, representing products using textual
and structured attributes, which enables efficient retrieval via Approximate
Nearest Neighbour search. We demonstrate how the same model architecture can be
adapted to serve three distinct recommendation tasks: similarity search,
complementary product suggestions, and inspirational content discovery, by
modifying only a handful of components in either the model or the serving
logic. Extensive A/B testing over two years confirms significant gains in
engagement and profit-based metrics across desktop and mobile app channels. Our
results show that a flexible, scalable architecture can serve diverse user
intents with minimal maintenance overhead.

Abstract: The large language model (LLM) powered recommendation paradigm has been
proposed to address the limitations of traditional recommender systems, which
often struggle to handle cold start users or items with new IDs. Despite its
effectiveness, this study uncovers that LLM empowered recommender systems are
vulnerable to reconstruction attacks that can expose both system and user
privacy. To examine this threat, we present the first systematic study on
inversion attacks targeting LLM empowered recommender systems, where
adversaries attempt to reconstruct original prompts that contain personal
preferences, interaction histories, and demographic attributes by exploiting
the output logits of recommendation models. We reproduce the vec2text framework
and optimize it using our proposed method called Similarity Guided Refinement,
enabling more accurate reconstruction of textual prompts from model generated
logits. Extensive experiments across two domains (movies and books) and two
representative LLM based recommendation models demonstrate that our method
achieves high fidelity reconstructions. Specifically, we can recover nearly 65
percent of the user interacted items and correctly infer age and gender in 87
percent of the cases. The experiments also reveal that privacy leakage is
largely insensitive to the victim model's performance but highly dependent on
domain consistency and prompt complexity. These findings expose critical
privacy vulnerabilities in LLM empowered recommender systems.

resources for identifying estate-related issues, especially in the context of
growing urban populations. In this work, we present a language model-based

framework to first filter relevant posts and then categorize them into
actionable estate-related topics. Additionally, for posts lacking explicit
geotags, we apply a transformer-based geolocation module to infer posting
locations at the point-of-interest level. This integrated approach supports

Abstract: The typical offline protocol to evaluate recommendation algorithms is to
collect a dataset of user-item interactions and then use a part of this dataset
to train a model, and the remaining data to measure how closely the model
recommendations match the observed user interactions. This protocol is
straightforward, useful and practical, but it only captures performance of a
particular model trained at some point in the past. We know, however, that
online systems evolve over time. In general, it is a good idea that models
reflect such changes, so models are frequently retrained with recent data. But
if this is the case, to what extent can we trust previous evaluations? How will
a model perform when a different pattern (re)emerges? In this paper we propose
a methodology to study how recommendation models behave when they are
retrained. The idea is to profile algorithms according to their ability to, on
the one hand, retain past patterns -- stability -- and, on the other hand,
(quickly) adapt to changes -- plasticity. We devise an offline evaluation
protocol that provides detail on the long-term behavior of models, and that is
agnostic to datasets, algorithms and metrics. To illustrate the potential of
this framework, we present preliminary results of three different types of
algorithms on the GoodReads dataset that suggest different stability and
plasticity profiles depending on the algorithmic technique, and a possible
trade-off between stability and plasticity.Although additional experiments will
be necessary to confirm these observations, they already illustrate the
usefulness of the proposed framework to gain insights on the long term dynamics
of recommendation models.

Abstract: Conversational search aims to satisfy users' complex information needs via

search intent from the context-dependent queries. Previous studies achieve
conversational search by fine-tuning a conversational dense retriever with
relevance judgments between pairs of context-dependent queries and documents.
However, this training paradigm encounters data scarcity issues. To this end,
we propose ConvMix, a mixed-criteria framework to augment conversational dense
retrieval, which covers more aspects than existing data augmentation
frameworks. We design a two-sided relevance judgment augmentation schema in a
scalable manner via the aid of large language models. Besides, we integrate the
framework with quality control mechanisms to obtain semantically diverse
samples and near-distribution supervisions to combine various annotated data.
Experimental results on five widely used benchmarks show that the
conversational dense retriever trained by our ConvMix framework outperforms
previous baseline methods, which demonstrates our superior effectiveness.

Abstract: The feedback loop in industrial recommendation systems reinforces homogeneous
content, creates filter bubble effects, and diminishes user satisfaction.
Recently, large language models(LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
serendipity recommendation, thanks to their extensive world knowledge and
superior reasoning capabilities. However, these models still face challenges in
ensuring the rationality of the reasoning process, the usefulness of the
reasoning results, and meeting the latency requirements of industrial
recommendation systems (RSs). To address these challenges, we propose a method
that leverages llm to dynamically construct user knowledge graphs, thereby
enhancing the serendipity of recommendation systems. This method comprises a
two stage framework:(1) two-hop interest reasoning, where user static profiles
and historical behaviors are utilized to dynamically construct user knowledge
graphs via llm. Two-hop reasoning, which can enhance the quality and accuracy
of LLM reasoning results, is then performed on the constructed graphs to
identify users' potential interests; and(2) Near-line adaptation, a
cost-effective approach to deploying the aforementioned models in industrial
recommendation systems. We propose a u2i (user-to-item) retrieval model that
also incorporates i2i (item-to-item) retrieval capabilities, the retrieved
items not only exhibit strong relevance to users' newly emerged interests but
also retain the high conversion rate of traditional u2i retrieval. Our online
experiments on the Dewu app, which has tens of millions of users, indicate that
the method increased the exposure novelty rate by 4.62%, the click novelty rate
by 4.85%, the average view duration per person by 0.15%, unique visitor click
through rate by 0.07%, and unique visitor interaction penetration by 0.30%,

Abstract: In modern online platforms, search and recommendation (S&R) often coexist,
offering opportunities for performance improvement through search-enhanced
approaches. Existing studies show that incorporating search signals boosts
recommendation performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods relies
heavily on rich search interactions. They primarily benefit a small subset of
users with abundant search behavior, while offering limited improvements for
the majority of users who exhibit only sparse search activity. To address the
problem of sparse search data in search-enhanced recommendation, we face two
key challenges: (1) how to learn useful search features for users with sparse
search interactions, and (2) how to design effective training objectives under
sparse conditions. Our idea is to leverage the features of users with rich
search interactions to enhance those of users with sparse search interactions.
Based on this idea, we propose GSERec, a method that utilizes message passing
on the User-Code Graphs to alleviate data sparsity in Search-Enhanced
Recommendation. Specifically, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) with
vector quantization to generate discrete codes, which connect similar users and
thereby construct the graph. Through message passing on this graph, embeddings
of users with rich search data are propagated to enhance the embeddings of
users with sparse interactions. To further ensure that the message passing
captures meaningful information from truly similar users, we introduce a
contrastive loss to better model user similarities. The enhanced user
representations are then integrated into downstream search-enhanced
recommendation models. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that
GSERec consistently outperforms baselines, especially for users with sparse
search behaviors.

Abstract: Search and recommendation (S&R) are fundamental components of modern online
platforms, yet effectively leveraging search behaviors to improve
recommendation remains a challenging problem. User search histories often
contain noisy or irrelevant signals that can even degrade recommendation
performance, while existing approaches typically encode S&R histories either
jointly or separately without explicitly identifying which search behaviors are
truly useful. Inspired by the human decision-making process, where one first
identifies recommendation intent and then reasons about relevant evidence, we
design a latent cross reasoning framework that first encodes user S&R histories
to capture global interests and then iteratively reasons over search behaviors
to extract signals beneficial for recommendation. Contrastive learning is
employed to align latent reasoning states with target items, and reinforcement
learning is further introduced to directly optimize ranking performance.
Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements
over strong baselines, validating the importance of reasoning in enhancing
search-aware recommendation.

encode the surrounding text of formulas. Finally, for each query and its
candidates, structural and semantic similarities are calculated separately and
then fused through a weighted scheme. In the ARQMath-3 formula retrieval task,
SSEmb outperforms existing embedding-based methods by over 5 percentage points
on P'@10 and nDCG'@10. Furthermore, SSEmb enhances the performance of all runs
of other methods and achieves state-of-the-art results when combined with

Abstract: Recommending long-form video content demands joint modeling of visual, audio,

LLM-augmented multimodal movie recommendation. Built on MovieLens and MMTF-14K,
it aligns dense item embeddings from three modalities: audio (block-level,
i-vector), visual (CNN, AVF), and text. Missing or sparse metadata is
automatically enriched using state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., OpenAI Ada),
generating high-quality synopses for thousands of movies. All text (raw or
augmented) is embedded with configurable encoders (Ada, LLaMA-2, Sentence-T5),
producing multiple ready-to-use sets. The pipeline supports interchangeable
early-, mid-, and late-fusion (concatenation, PCA, CCA, rank-aggregation) and
multiple backbones (MF, VAECF, VBPR, AMR, VMF) for ablation. Experiments are
fully declarative via a single YAML file. Evaluation spans accuracy (Recall,
nDCG) and beyond-accuracy metrics: cold-start rate, coverage, novelty,
diversity, fairness. Results show LLM-based augmentation and strong text
embeddings boost cold-start and coverage, especially when fused with
audio-visual features. Systematic benchmarking reveals universal versus
backbone- or metric-specific combinations. Open-source code, embeddings, and

Abstract: Recommender systems learn from past user behavior to predict future user
preferences. Intuitively, it has been established that the most recent
interactions are more indicative of future preferences than older interactions.
Many recommendation algorithms use this notion to either drop older
interactions or to assign them a lower weight, so the model can focus on the
more informative, recent information. However, very few approaches model the
flow of time explicitly.
  This paper analyzes how time can be encoded in factorization-style
recommendation models. By including absolute time as a feature, our models can
learn varying user preferences and changing item perception over time. In
addition to simple binning approaches, we also propose a novel, fully
continuous time encoding mechanism. Through the use of a polynomial fit inside
the loss function, our models completely avoid the need for discretization, and
they are able to capture the time dimension in arbitrary resolution.
  We perform a comparative study on three real-world datasets that span
multiple years, where long user histories are present, and items stay relevant
for a longer time. Empirical results show that, by explicitly modeling time,
our models are very effective at capturing temporal signals, such as varying
item popularities over time. Despite this however, our experiments also
indicate that a simple post-hoc popularity adjustment is often sufficient to
achieve the best performance on the unseen test set. This teaches us that, for
the recommendation task, predicting the future is more important than capturing
past trends. As such, we argue that specialized mechanisms are needed for
extrapolation to future data.

Abstract: Multimodal recommender systems (MRS) improve recommendation performance by
integrating diverse semantic information from multiple modalities. However, the
assumption of the availability of all modalities rarely holds in practice due
to missing images, incomplete descriptions, or inconsistent user content. These
challenges significantly degrade the robustness and generalization capabilities
of current models. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel method
called \textbf{I$^3$-MRec}, which uses \textbf{I}nvariant learning with
\textbf{I}nformation bottleneck principle for \textbf{I}ncomplete
\textbf{M}odality \textbf{Rec}ommendation. To achieve robust performance in
missing modality scenarios, I$^3$-MRec enforces two pivotal properties: (i)
cross-modal preference invariance, which ensures consistent user preference
modeling across varying modality environments, and (ii) compact yet effective
modality representation, which filters out task-irrelevant modality information
while maximally preserving essential features relevant to recommendation. By
treating each modality as a distinct semantic environment, I$^3$-MRec employs
invariant risk minimization (IRM) to learn modality-specific item
representations. In parallel, a missing-aware fusion module grounded in the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle extracts compact and effective item
embeddings by suppressing modality noise and preserving core user preference
signals. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets
demonstrate that I$^3$-MRec consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art
MRS methods across various modality-missing scenarios, highlighting its
effectiveness and robustness in practical applications. The code and processed
datasets are released at https://github.com/HuilinChenJN/I3-MRec.

Abstract: This study proposes NIRMAL (Novel Integrated Robust Multi-Adaptation
Learning), a novel optimization algorithm that combines multiple strategies
inspired by the movements of the chess piece. These strategies include gradient
descent, momentum, stochastic perturbations, adaptive learning rates, and
non-linear transformations. We carefully evaluated NIRMAL against two widely
used and successful optimizers, Adam and SGD with Momentum, on four benchmark
image classification datasets: MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.
The custom convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is applied on each
dataset. The experimental results show that NIRMAL achieves competitive
performance, particularly on the more challenging CIFAR-100 dataset, where it
achieved a test accuracy of 45.32\%and a weighted F1-score of 0.4328. This
performance surpasses Adam (41.79\% accuracy, 0.3964 F1-score) and closely
matches SGD with Momentum (46.97\% accuracy, 0.4531 F1-score). Also, NIRMAL
exhibits robust convergence and strong generalization capabilities, especially
on complex datasets, as evidenced by stable training results in loss and
accuracy curves. These findings underscore NIRMAL's significant ability as a
versatile and effective optimizer for various deep learning tasks.

Abstract: The Algorithm Selection Problem for recommender systems-choosing the best
algorithm for a given user or context-remains a significant challenge.
Traditional meta-learning approaches often treat algorithms as categorical
choices, ignoring their intrinsic properties. Recent work has shown that
explicitly characterizing algorithms with features can improve model
performance in other domains. Building on this, we propose a per-user
meta-learning approach for recommender system selection that leverages both
user meta-features and automatically extracted algorithm features from source
code. Our preliminary results, averaged over six diverse datasets, show that
augmenting a meta-learner with algorithm features improves its average NDCG@10
performance by 8.83% from 0.135 (user features only) to 0.147. This enhanced
model outperforms the Single Best Algorithm baseline (0.131) and successfully
closes 10.5% of the performance gap to a theoretical oracle selector. These
findings show that even static source code metrics provide a valuable
predictive signal, presenting a promising direction for building more robust
and intelligent recommender systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked powerful
reasoning and decision-making capabilities. However, their inherent dependence
on static parametric memory fundamentally limits their adaptability, factual
accuracy, and interpretability in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Knowledge
graphs (KGs), as structured repositories of explicit relational knowledge,
offer a promising approach for augmenting LLMs with external, interpretable
memory. Nevertheless, most existing methods that combine LLMs with KGs treat
reasoning and knowledge updating as separate processes, resulting in suboptimal
utilization of new information and hindering real-time updates. In this work,
we propose TRAIL: a novel, unified framework for Thinking, Reasoning, And
Incremental Learning that couples joint inference and dynamic KG refinement
with large language models. TRAIL enables LLM agents to iteratively explore,
update, and refine knowledge graphs during the reasoning process, employing a
confidence-driven mechanism for the generation, validation, and pruning of new
facts. This plug-and-play architecture facilitates seamless integration with
various LLMs, supporting continual adaptation without the need for retraining.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TRAIL outperforms
existing KG-augmented and retrieval-augmented LLM baselines by 3% to 13%. More
importantly, these results represent a significant step toward developing
adaptive, memory-augmented language models capable of continual learning and
reliable, transparent reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Recommender Systems aim to improve recommendation accuracy by
integrating heterogeneous content, such as images and textual metadata. While
effective, it remains unclear whether their gains stem from true multimodal
understanding or increased model complexity. This work investigates the role of
multimodal item embeddings, emphasizing the semantic informativeness of the
representations. Initial experiments reveal that embeddings from standard
extractors (e.g., ResNet50, Sentence-Bert) enhance performance, but rely on
modality-specific encoders and ad hoc fusion strategies that lack control over
cross-modal alignment. To overcome these limitations, we leverage Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generate multimodal-by-design embeddings via
structured prompts. This approach yields semantically aligned representations
without requiring any fusion. Experiments across multiple settings show notable
performance improvements. Furthermore, LVLMs embeddings offer a distinctive
advantage: they can be decoded into structured textual descriptions, enabling
direct assessment of their multimodal comprehension. When such descriptions are
incorporated as side content into recommender systems, they improve
recommendation performance, empirically validating the semantic depth and
alignment encoded within LVLMs outputs. Our study highlights the importance of
semantically rich representations and positions LVLMs as a compelling
foundation for building robust and meaningful multimodal representations in
recommendation tasks.

Abstract: The accelerating pace of research on autoregressive generative models has

studies increasingly impractical. We present a fully open-source, reproducible
pipeline that automatically retrieves candidate documents from public

and generates containerised scripts for re-running selected experiments.
Quantitative evaluation on 50 manually-annotated papers shows F1 scores above

identification. Experiments on corpora of up to 1000 papers demonstrate
near-linear scalability with eight CPU workers. Three case studies -- AWD-LSTM

on the Lakh MIDI dataset -- confirm that the extracted settings support
faithful reproduction, achieving test perplexities within 1--3% of the original

Abstract: Recommender systems are indispensable for helping users navigate the immense
item catalogs of modern online platforms. Recently, generative recommendation
has emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional
retrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic
generation. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained
by their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from
two critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking
a coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement
(i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity.
To overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that
learns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core
innovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization
process that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more
uniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict
hierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for
each recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE
incorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space
overlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but
also promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive
utilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled
IDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models. Extensive
experiments on three public benchmarks validate HiD-VAE's superior performance
against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HiD-VAE-84B2.

Abstract: This study introduces Query Attribute Modeling (QAM), a hybrid framework that
enhances search precision and relevance by decomposing open text queries into
structured metadata tags and semantic elements. QAM addresses traditional
search limitations by automatically extracting metadata filters from free-form
text queries, reducing noise and enabling focused retrieval of relevant items.
  Experimental evaluation using the Amazon Toys Reviews dataset (10,000 unique
items with 40,000+ reviews and detailed product attributes) demonstrated QAM's
superior performance, achieving a mean average precision at 5 (mAP@5) of
52.99\%. This represents significant improvement over conventional methods,
including BM25 keyword search, encoder-based semantic similarity search,
cross-encoder re-ranking, and hybrid search combining BM25 and semantic results
via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). The results establish QAM as a robust
solution for Enterprise Search applications, particularly in e-commerce
systems.

Abstract: Generative models are a class of AI models capable of creating new instances
of data by learning and sampling from their statistical distributions. In
recent years, these models have gained prominence in machine learning due to
the development of approaches such as generative adversarial networks (GANs),
variational autoencoders (VAEs), and transformer-based architectures such as
GPT. These models have applications across various domains, such as image
generation, text synthesis, and music composition. In recommender systems,
generative models, referred to as Gen-RecSys, improve the accuracy and
diversity of recommendations by generating structured outputs, text-based
interactions, and multimedia content. By leveraging these capabilities,
Gen-RecSys can produce more personalized, engaging, and dynamic user
experiences, expanding the role of AI in eCommerce, media, and beyond.
  Our book goes beyond existing literature by offering a comprehensive
understanding of generative models and their applications, with a special focus
on deep generative models (DGMs) and their classification. We introduce a
taxonomy that categorizes DGMs into three types: ID-driven models, large
language models (LLMs), and multimodal models. Each category addresses unique
technical and architectural advancements within its respective research area.
This taxonomy allows researchers to easily navigate developments in Gen-RecSys
across domains such as conversational AI and multimodal content generation.
Additionally, we examine the impact and potential risks of generative models,
emphasizing the importance of robust evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Affective Computing (AC) has made significant progress with the advent of
deep learning, yet a persistent challenge remains: the reliable transfer of
affective models from controlled laboratory settings (in-vitro) to uncontrolled
real-world environments (in-vivo). To address this challenge we introduce the
Privileged Contrastive Pretraining (PriCon) framework according to which models
are first pretrained via supervised contrastive learning (SCL) and then act as
teacher models within a Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) framework.
PriCon both leverages privileged information during training and enhances the
robustness of derived affect models via SCL. Experiments conducted on two
benchmark affective corpora, RECOLA and AGAIN, demonstrate that models trained
using PriCon consistently outperform LUPI and end to end models. Remarkably, in
many cases, PriCon models achieve performance comparable to models trained with
access to all modalities during both training and testing. The findings
underscore the potential of PriCon as a paradigm towards further bridging the
gap between in-vitro and in-vivo affective modelling, offering a scalable and
practical solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Location-aware devices continuously generate massive volumes of trajectory
data, creating demand for efficient compression. Line simplification is a
common solution but typically assumes 2D trajectories and ignores time
synchronization and motion continuity. We propose PILOT-C, a novel trajectory
compression framework that integrates frequency-domain physics modeling with
error-bounded optimization. Unlike existing line simplification methods,
PILOT-C supports trajectories in arbitrary dimensions, including 3D, by
compressing each spatial axis independently. Evaluated on four real-world
datasets, PILOT-C achieves superior performance across multiple dimensions. In
terms of compression ratio, PILOT-C outperforms CISED-W, the current
state-of-the-art SED-based line simplification algorithm, by an average of
19.2%. For trajectory fidelity, PILOT-C achieves an average of 32.6% reduction
in error compared to CISED-W. Additionally, PILOT-C seamlessly extends to
three-dimensional trajectories while maintaining the same computational
complexity, achieving a 49% improvement in compression ratios over SQUISH-E,
the most efficient line simplification algorithm on 3D datasets.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic
modalities in clinical practice, encompassing a broad spectrum of diagnostic
tasks. Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of
reasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to
enhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability. However, existing
multimodal models predominantly rely on "one-time" diagnostic approaches,
lacking verifiable supervision of the reasoning process. This leads to
challenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, including lengthy reasoning, sparse
rewards, and frequent hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose
CX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved "think-answer"
reasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and
verifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an
instruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148
samples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points
supervised by clinical reports. Optimization was conducted in two stages under
the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework: initially stabilizing basic
reasoning with closed-domain tasks, followed by transfer to open-domain
diagnostics, incorporating rule-based conditional process rewards to bypass the
need for pretrained reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing medical and general-domain
MLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment,
achieving an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable
CXR-specific models. On real-world clinical dataset (Rui-CXR), CX-Mind achieves
a mean recall@1 across 14 diseases that substantially surpasses the second-best
results, with multi-center expert evaluations further confirming its clinical
utility across multiple dimensions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often retain inaccurate or outdated information
from pre-training, leading to incorrect predictions or biased outputs during
inference. While existing model editing methods can address this challenge,
they struggle with editing large amounts of factual information simultaneously
and may compromise the general capabilities of the models. In this paper, our
empirical study demonstrates that it is feasible to edit the internal
representations of LLMs and replace the entities in a manner similar to editing
natural language inputs. Based on this insight, we introduce the Latent
Knowledge Scalpel (LKS), an LLM editor that manipulates the latent knowledge of
specific entities via a lightweight hypernetwork to enable precise and
large-scale editing. Experiments conducted on Llama-2 and Mistral show even
with the number of simultaneous edits reaching 10,000, LKS effectively performs
knowledge editing while preserving the general abilities of the edited LLMs.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of glaucoma is critical to prevent irreversible

interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. In this paper, we present
GlaBoost, a multimodal gradient boosting framework that integrates structured
clinical features, fundus image embeddings, and expert-curated textual
descriptions for glaucoma risk prediction. GlaBoost extracts high-level visual
representations from retinal fundus photographs using a pretrained
convolutional encoder and encodes free-text neuroretinal rim assessments using
a transformer-based language model. These heterogeneous signals, combined with
manually assessed risk scores and quantitative ophthalmic indicators, are fused
into a unified feature space for classification via an enhanced XGBoost model.
Experiments conducted on a real-world annotated dataset demonstrate that
GlaBoost significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving a validation
accuracy of 98.71%. Feature importance analysis reveals clinically consistent
patterns, with cup-to-disc ratio, rim pallor, and specific textual embeddings
contributing most to model decisions. GlaBoost offers a transparent and
scalable solution for interpretable glaucoma diagnosis and can be extended to
other ophthalmic disorders.

Abstract: Multi-dimensional data completion is a critical problem in computational
sciences, particularly in domains such as computer vision, signal processing,
and scientific computing. Existing methods typically leverage either global
low-rank approximations or local smoothness regularization, but each suffers
from notable limitations: low-rank methods are computationally expensive and
may disrupt intrinsic data structures, while smoothness-based approaches often
require extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit poor generalization. In
this paper, we propose a novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep)
model that unifies global and local prior modeling within a Tucker
decomposition. Specifically, LRTuckerRep encodes low rankness through a
self-adaptive weighted nuclear norm on the factor matrices and a sparse Tucker
core, while capturing smoothness via a parameter-free Laplacian-based
regularization on the factor spaces. To efficiently solve the resulting
nonconvex optimization problem, we develop two iterative algorithms with
provable convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional
image inpainting and traffic data imputation demonstrate that LRTuckerRep
achieves superior completion accuracy and robustness under high missing rates
compared to baselines.

Abstract: The specification of prior distributions is fundamental in Bayesian
inference, yet it remains a significant bottleneck. The prior elicitation
process is often a manual, subjective, and unscalable task. We propose a novel
framework which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and scale
this process. We introduce \texttt{LLMPrior}, a principled operator that
translates rich, unstructured contexts such as natural language descriptions,
data or figures into valid, tractable probability distributions. We formalize
this operator by architecturally coupling an LLM with an explicit, tractable
generative model, such as a Gaussian Mixture Model (forming a LLM based Mixture
Density Network), ensuring the resulting prior satisfies essential mathematical
properties. We further extend this framework to multi-agent systems where
Logarithmic Opinion Pooling is employed to aggregate prior distributions
induced by decentralized knowledge. We present the federated prior aggregation
algorithm, \texttt{Fed-LLMPrior}, for aggregating distributed,
context-dependent priors in a manner robust to agent heterogeneity. This work
provides the foundation for a new class of tools that can potentially lower the
barrier to entry for sophisticated Bayesian modeling.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces significant challenges in real-world
deployments due to the sim-to-real gap, where policies trained in simulators
often underperform in practice due to mismatches between training and
deployment conditions. Distributionally robust RL addresses this issue by
optimizing worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of environments and
providing an optimized lower bound on deployment performance. However, existing
studies typically assume access to either a generative model or offline
datasets with broad coverage of the deployment environment -- assumptions that
limit their practicality in unknown environments without prior knowledge. In
this work, we study the more realistic and challenging setting of online
distributionally robust RL, where the agent interacts only with a single
unknown training environment while aiming to optimize its worst-case
performance. We focus on general $f$-divergence-based uncertainty sets,
including Chi-Square and KL divergence balls, and propose a computationally
efficient algorithm with sublinear regret guarantees under minimal assumptions.
Furthermore, we establish a minimax lower bound on regret of online learning,
demonstrating the near-optimality of our approach. Extensive experiments across
diverse environments further confirm the robustness and efficiency of our
algorithm, validating our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and
alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective
approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we
reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear
in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting
gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be
essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded
completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward
unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading
learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective
policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative
Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens
appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards,
protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To
further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy
exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence
regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training,
while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance,
validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.

Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) scattering modeling is critical for radar remote
sensing, however, its inherent complexity introduces significant computational
challenges. Traditional numerical solvers offer high accuracy, but suffer from
scalability issues and substantial computational costs. Pure data-driven deep
learning approaches, while efficient, lack physical constraints embedding
during training and require extensive labeled data, limiting their
applicability and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
U-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet), the first fully
deep-learning-based, physics-informed hierarchical framework for computational
EM designed to ensure physical consistency while maximizing computational
efficiency. Motivated by the hierarchical decomposition strategy in EM solvers
and the inherent sparsity of local EM coupling, the U-PINet models the
decomposition and coupling of near- and far-field interactions through a
multiscale processing neural network architecture, while employing a
physics-inspired sparse graph representation to efficiently model both self-
and mutual- coupling among mesh elements of complex $3$-Dimensional (3D)
objects. This principled approach enables end-to-end multiscale EM scattering
modeling with improved efficiency, generalization, and physical consistency.
Experimental results showcase that the U-PINet accurately predicts surface
current distributions, achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while
significantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep
learning baselines in both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, our
evaluations on radar cross section prediction tasks confirm the feasibility of
the U-PINet for downstream EM scattering applications.

Abstract: Estimating heat flux in the nuclear fusion device EAST is a critically
important task. Traditional scientific computing methods typically model this
process using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, FEM relies on
grid-based sampling for computation, which is computationally inefficient and
hard to perform real-time simulations during actual experiments. Inspired by
artificial intelligence-powered scientific computing, this paper proposes a
novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to address this challenge,
significantly accelerating the heat conduction estimation process while
maintaining high accuracy. Specifically, given inputs of different materials,
we first feed spatial coordinates and time stamps into the neural network, and
compute boundary loss, initial condition loss, and physical loss based on the
heat conduction equation. Additionally, we sample a small number of data points
in a data-driven manner to better fit the specific heat conduction scenario,
further enhancing the model's predictive capability. We conduct experiments
under both uniform and non-uniform heating conditions on the top surface.
Experimental results show that the proposed thermal conduction physics-informed
neural network achieves accuracy comparable to the finite element method, while
achieving $\times$40 times acceleration in computational efficiency. The
dataset and source code will be released on

Abstract: While recent advances in foundation models have improved the state of the art
in many domains, some problems in empirical sciences could not benefit from
this progress yet. Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains
challenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a
complex hierarchically structured label taxonomy. Accurate classification of
soil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts
agricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate
resilience. In this work, we propose $\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal
multitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized
pipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first
predict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates.
Each segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological
features. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal
concatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to
account for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons. Our
method is designed to address complex hierarchical classification, where the
number of possible labels is very large, imbalanced and non-trivially
structured. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world
soil profile dataset. All code and experiments can be found in our repository:

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a crucial approach for
adapting large foundational models to specific tasks, particularly as model
sizes continue to grow exponentially. Among PEFT methods, Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) (arXiv:2106.09685) stands out for its effectiveness and simplicity,
expressing adaptations as a product of two low-rank matrices. While extensive
empirical studies demonstrate LoRA's practical utility, theoretical
understanding of such methods remains limited. Recent work on RAC-LoRA
(arXiv:2410.08305) took initial steps toward rigorous analysis. In this work,
we introduce Bernoulli-LoRA, a novel theoretical framework that unifies and
extends existing LoRA approaches. Our method introduces a probabilistic
Bernoulli mechanism for selecting which matrix to update. This approach
encompasses and generalizes various existing update strategies while
maintaining theoretical tractability. Under standard assumptions from
non-convex optimization literature, we analyze several variants of our
framework: Bernoulli-LoRA-GD, Bernoulli-LoRA-SGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE,
Bernoulli-LoRA-MVR, Bernoulli-LoRA-QGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-MARINA, and
Bernoulli-LoRA-EF21, establishing convergence guarantees for each variant.
Additionally, we extend our analysis to convex non-smooth functions, providing
convergence rates for both constant and adaptive (Polyak-type) stepsizes.
Through extensive experiments on various tasks, we validate our theoretical
findings and demonstrate the practical efficacy of our approach. This work is a
step toward developing theoretically grounded yet practically effective PEFT
methods.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a widely used approach for blackbox
optimization that leverages a Gaussian process (GP) model and an acquisition
function to guide future sampling. While effective in low-dimensional settings,
BO faces scalability challenges in high-dimensional spaces and with large
number of function evaluations due to the computational complexity of GP
models. In contrast, neural networks (NNs) offer better scalability and can
model complex functions, which led to the development of NN-based BO
approaches. However, these methods typically rely on estimating model
uncertainty in NN prediction -- a process that is often computationally
intensive and complex, particularly in high dimensions. To address these
limitations, a novel method, called scalable neural network-based blackbox
optimization (SNBO), is proposed that does not rely on model uncertainty
estimation. Specifically, SNBO adds new samples using separate criteria for
exploration and exploitation, while adaptively controlling the sampling region
to ensure efficient optimization. SNBO is evaluated on a range of optimization
problems spanning from 10 to 102 dimensions and compared against four
state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Across the majority of test problems,
SNBO attains function values better than the best-performing baseline
algorithm, while requiring 40-60% fewer function evaluations and reducing the
runtime by at least an order of magnitude.

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit algorithms are fundamental tools for sequential
decision-making under uncertainty, with widespread applications across domains
such as clinical trials and personalized decision-making. As bandit algorithms
are increasingly deployed in these socially sensitive settings, it becomes
critical to protect user data privacy and ensure fair treatment across decision
rounds. While prior work has independently addressed privacy and fairness in
bandit settings, the question of whether both objectives can be achieved
simultaneously has remained largely open. Existing privacy-preserving bandit
algorithms typically optimize average regret, a utilitarian measure, whereas
fairness-aware approaches focus on minimizing Nash regret, which penalizes
inequitable reward distributions, but often disregard privacy concerns.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce Differentially Private Nash Confidence Bound
(DP-NCB)-a novel and unified algorithmic framework that simultaneously ensures
$\epsilon$-differential privacy and achieves order-optimal Nash regret,
matching known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. The framework is
sufficiently general to operate under both global and local differential
privacy models, and is anytime, requiring no prior knowledge of the time
horizon. We support our theoretical guarantees with simulations on synthetic
bandit instances, showing that DP-NCB incurs substantially lower Nash regret
than state-of-the-art baselines. Our results offer a principled foundation for
designing bandit algorithms that are both privacy-preserving and fair, making
them suitable for high-stakes, socially impactful applications.

Abstract: We propose a trainable-by-parts surrogate model for solving forward and
inverse parameterized nonlinear partial differential equations. Like several
other surrogate and operator learning models, the proposed approach employs an
encoder to reduce the high-dimensional input $y(\bm{x})$ to a lower-dimensional
latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$. Then, a fully connected neural network is
used to map $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$ to the latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_h}$, of
the PDE solution $h(\bm{x},t)$. Finally, a decoder is utilized to reconstruct
$h(\bm{x},t)$. The innovative aspect of our model is its ability to train its
three components independently. This approach leads to a substantial decrease
in both the time and energy required for training when compared to leading
operator learning models such as FNO and DeepONet. The separable training is
achieved by training the encoder as part of the variational autoencoder (VAE)
for $y(\bm{x})$ and the decoder as part of the $h(\bm{x},t)$ VAE. We refer to
this model as the VAE-DNN model. VAE-DNN is compared to the FNO and DeepONet
models for obtaining forward and inverse solutions to the nonlinear diffusion
equation governing groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer. Our findings
indicate that VAE-DNN not only demonstrates greater efficiency but also
delivers superior accuracy in both forward and inverse solutions compared to
the FNO and DeepONet models.

Abstract: Accurate spectrum demand prediction is crucial for informed spectrum
allocation, effective regulatory planning, and fostering sustainable growth in
modern wireless communication networks. It supports governmental efforts,
particularly those led by the international telecommunication union (ITU), to
establish fair spectrum allocation policies, improve auction mechanisms, and
meet the requirements of emerging technologies such as advanced 5G, forthcoming
6G, and the internet of things (IoT). This paper presents an effective
spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages crowdsourced user-side key
performance indicators (KPIs) and regulatory datasets to model and forecast
spectrum demand. The proposed methodology achieves superior prediction accuracy
and cross-regional generalizability by incorporating advanced feature
engineering, comprehensive correlation analysis, and transfer learning
techniques. Unlike traditional ITU models, which are often constrained by
arbitrary inputs and unrealistic assumptions, this approach exploits granular,
data-driven insights to account for spatial and temporal variations in spectrum
utilization. Comparative evaluations against ITU estimates, as the benchmark,
underscore our framework's capability to deliver more realistic and actionable
predictions. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our methodology,
highlighting its potential as a robust approach for policymakers and regulatory
bodies to enhance spectrum management and planning.

predictions of interest. Empirically, we demonstrate that this
prediction-oriented approach performs better than a previously proposed
information-theoretic technique on two widely studied problems. At the same
time, we highlight that reliably achieving strong performance in practice
requires careful model design.

Abstract: With the end of Moore's law and Dennard scaling, efficient training
increasingly requires rethinking data volume. Can we train better models with
significantly less data via intelligent subsampling? To explore this, we
develop SICKLE, a sparse intelligent curation framework for efficient learning,
featuring a novel maximum entropy (MaxEnt) sampling approach, scalable
training, and energy benchmarking. We compare MaxEnt with random and
phase-space sampling on large direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets of
turbulence. Evaluating SICKLE at scale on Frontier, we show that subsampling as
a preprocessing step can improve model accuracy and substantially lower energy
consumption, with reductions of up to 38x observed in certain cases.

Abstract: Managing physiological variables within clinically safe target zones is a
central challenge in healthcare, particularly for chronic conditions such as
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Reinforcement learning (RL) offers promise for
personalising treatment, but struggles with the delayed and heterogeneous
effects of interventions. We propose a novel RL framework to study and support
decision-making in T1DM technologies, such as automated insulin delivery. Our
approach captures the complex temporal dynamics of treatment by unifying two
control modalities: \textit{impulse control} for discrete, fast-acting
interventions (e.g., insulin boluses), and \textit{switching control} for
longer-acting treatments and regime shifts. The core of our method is a
constrained Markov decision process augmented with physiological state
features, enabling safe policy learning under clinical and resource
constraints. The framework incorporates biologically realistic factors,
including insulin decay, leading to policies that better reflect real-world
therapeutic behaviour. While not intended for clinical deployment, this work
establishes a foundation for future safe and temporally-aware RL in healthcare.
We provide theoretical guarantees of convergence and demonstrate empirical
improvements in a stylised T1DM control task, reducing blood glucose level
violations from 22.4\% (state-of-the-art) to as low as 10.8\%.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of grape phenology is essential for timely vineyard
management decisions, such as scheduling irrigation and fertilization, to
maximize crop yield and quality. While traditional biophysical models
calibrated on historical field data can be used for season-long predictions,
they lack the precision required for fine-grained vineyard management. Deep
learning methods are a compelling alternative but their performance is hindered
by sparse phenology datasets, particularly at the cultivar level. We propose a
hybrid modeling approach that combines multi-task learning with a recurrent
neural network to parameterize a differentiable biophysical model. By using
multi-task learning to predict the parameters of the biophysical model, our
approach enables shared learning across cultivars while preserving biological
structure, thereby improving the robustness and accuracy of predictions.
Empirical evaluation using real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrates that
our method significantly outperforms both conventional biophysical models and
baseline deep learning approaches in predicting phenological stages, as well as
other crop state variables such as cold-hardiness and wheat yield.

Abstract: Distance-based classifiers, such as k-nearest neighbors and support vector
machines, continue to be a workhorse of machine learning, widely used in
science and industry. In practice, to derive insights from these models, it is
also important to ensure that their predictions are explainable. While the
field of Explainable AI has supplied methods that are in principle applicable
to any model, it has also emphasized the usefulness of latent structures (e.g.
the sequence of layers in a neural network) to produce explanations. In this
paper, we contribute by uncovering a hidden neural network structure in
distance-based classifiers (consisting of linear detection units combined with
nonlinear pooling layers) upon which Explainable AI techniques such as
layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) become applicable. Through quantitative
evaluations, we demonstrate the advantage of our novel explanation approach
over several baselines. We also show the overall usefulness of explaining
distance-based models through two practical use cases.

Abstract: This paper examines the effectiveness of combining active learning and
transfer learning for anomaly detection in cross-domain time-series data. Our
results indicate that there is an interaction between clustering and active
learning and in general the best performance is achieved using a single cluster
(in other words when clustering is not applied). Also, we find that adding new
samples to the training set using active learning does improve model
performance but that in general, the rate of improvement is slower than the
results reported in the literature suggest. We attribute this difference to an
improved experimental design where distinct data samples are used for the
sampling and testing pools. Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of
transfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets
and find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail
off as more target points are selected for inclusion in training. This tail-off
in performance may indicate that the active learning process is doing a good
job of sequencing data points for selection, pushing the less useful points
towards the end of the selection process and that this tail-off occurs when
these less useful points are eventually added. Taken together our results
indicate that active learning is effective but that the improvement in model
performance follows a linear flat function concerning the number of points
selected and labelled.

Abstract: Bridging the microscopic and the macroscopic modelling scales in crowd
dynamics constitutes an important, open challenge for systematic numerical
analysis, optimization, and control. We propose a combined manifold and machine
learning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent
crowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The
proposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation
Equation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and
multiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the
mass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first
step, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete
microscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based
on manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space
into the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the
corresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning
reduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning
techniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the
crowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density
profiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density
distribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this "embed->learn in latent
space->lift back to the ambient space" pipeline, we create an effective
solution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution.
For our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a
corridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions. The numerical
results demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, thus
allowing for fast and accurate modelling/simulation of crowd dynamics from
agent-based simulations.

Additionally, we show that more involved encoding of the states enables more

Abstract: Fairness metrics utilizing the area under the receiver operator
characteristic curve (AUC) have gained increasing attention in high-stakes
domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. In these domains,
fairness is often evaluated over risk scores rather than binary outcomes, and a
common challenge is that enforcing strict fairness can significantly degrade
AUC performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional
Optimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework
that strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups
using optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable
proportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged
group. By varying lambda, our method allows for a tunable trade-off between
reducing AUC disparities and maintaining overall AUC performance. Furthermore,
we extend FairPOT to the partial AUC setting, enabling fairness interventions
to concentrate on the highest-risk regions. Extensive experiments on synthetic,
public, and clinical datasets show that FairPOT consistently outperforms
existing post-processing techniques in both global and partial AUC scenarios,
often achieving improved fairness with slight AUC degradation or even positive
gains in utility. The computational efficiency and practical adaptability of
FairPOT make it a promising solution for real-world deployment.

(PI-DeepONet) framework, leveraging DeepONet's powerful universal approximation
capabilities for operator learning alongside the robust physical fidelity
provided by the physics-informed neural networks. To mitigate the inherent
spectral bias in deep learning, BubbleONet integrates the Rowdy adaptive
activation function, enabling improved representation of high-frequency

Rayleigh-Plesset equation based bubble dynamics with a single initial radius,
(2) Keller-Miksis equation based bubble dynamics with a single initial radius,
and (3) Keller-Miksis equation based bubble dynamics with multiple initial
radii. Moreover, the performance of single-step versus two-step training
techniques for BubbleONet is investigated. The results demonstrate that
BubbleONet serves as a promising surrogate model for simulating bubble
dynamics, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional
numerical solvers.

Abstract: User-controllable privacy is important in modern sensing systems, as privacy
preferences can vary significantly from person to person and may evolve over
time. This is especially relevant in devices equipped with Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) sensors, such as smartphones and wearables, which continuously
collect rich time-series data that can inadvertently expose sensitive user
behaviors. While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor
data, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large
quantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user
agency. In this work, we introduce PrivCLIP, a dynamic, user-controllable,
few-shot privacy-preserving sensing framework. PrivCLIP allows users to specify
and modify their privacy preferences by categorizing activities as sensitive
(black-listed), non-sensitive (white-listed), or neutral (gray-listed).
Leveraging a multimodal contrastive learning approach, PrivCLIP aligns IMU
sensor data with natural language activity descriptions in a shared embedding
space, enabling few-shot detection of sensitive activities. When a
privacy-sensitive activity is identified, the system uses a language-guided
activity sanitizer and a motion generation module (IMU-GPT) to transform the
original data into a privacy-compliant version that semantically resembles a
non-sensitive activity. We evaluate PrivCLIP on multiple human activity
recognition datasets and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms baseline
methods in terms of both privacy protection and data utility.

Abstract: Despite the success of the monolithic dense paradigm of large language models
(LLMs), the LoRA adapters offer an efficient solution by fine-tuning small
task-specific modules and merging them with the base model. However, in
multi-task settings, merging LoRA adapters trained on heterogeneous sources
frequently causes \textit{task interference}, degrading downstream performance.
To address this, we propose a tensorized clustered LoRA (TC-LoRA) library
targeting to address the task interference at the \textit{text-level} and
\textit{parameter-level}. At the \textit{text-level}, we cluster the training
samples in the embedding space to capture input-format similarities, then train
a specialized LoRA adapter for each cluster. At the \textit{parameter-level},
we introduce a joint Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition that disentangles
task-specific and shared factors across LoRA adapters. This joint factorization
preserves essential knowledge while reducing cross-task interference. Extensive
experiments on out-of-domain zero-shot and skill-composition tasks-including
reasoning, question answering, and coding. Compared to strong SVD-based
baselines, TC-LoRA achieves +1.4\% accuracy on Phi-3 and +2.3\% on Mistral-7B
(+2.3\%), demonstrating the effectiveness of TC-LoRA in LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm that allows
multiple participants to train a shared model by exchanging model updates
instead of their raw data. However, its performance is degraded compared to
centralized approaches due to data heterogeneity across clients. While
contrastive learning has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this, our
theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental conflict: its asymptotic assumptions
of an infinite number of negative samples are violated in finite-sample regime
of federated learning. To address this issue, we introduce Decoupled
Contrastive Learning for Federated Learning (DCFL), a novel framework that
decouples the existing contrastive loss into two objectives. Decoupling the
loss into its alignment and uniformity components enables the independent
calibration of the attraction and repulsion forces without relying on the
asymptotic assumptions. This strategy provides a contrastive learning method
suitable for federated learning environments where each client has a small
amount of data. Our experimental results show that DCFL achieves stronger
alignment between positive samples and greater uniformity between negative
samples compared to existing contrastive learning methods. Furthermore,
experimental results on standard benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet, demonstrate that DCFL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
federated learning methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative survey of TensorFlow and
PyTorch, the two leading deep learning frameworks, focusing on their usability,
performance, and deployment trade-offs. We review each framework's programming
paradigm and developer experience, contrasting TensorFlow's graph-based (now
optionally eager) approach with PyTorch's dynamic, Pythonic style. We then
compare model training speeds and inference performance across multiple tasks
and data regimes, drawing on recent benchmarks and studies. Deployment
flexibility is examined in depth - from TensorFlow's mature ecosystem
(TensorFlow Lite for mobile/embedded, TensorFlow Serving, and JavaScript
support) to PyTorch's newer production tools (TorchScript compilation, ONNX
export, and TorchServe). We also survey ecosystem and community support,
including library integrations, industry adoption, and research trends (e.g.,
PyTorch's dominance in recent research publications versus TensorFlow's broader
tooling in enterprise). Applications in computer vision, natural language
processing, and other domains are discussed to illustrate how each framework is
used in practice. Finally, we outline future directions and open challenges in
deep learning framework design, such as unifying eager and graph execution,
improving cross-framework interoperability, and integrating compiler
optimizations (XLA, JIT) for improved speed. Our findings indicate that while
both frameworks are highly capable for state-of-the-art deep learning, they
exhibit distinct trade-offs: PyTorch offers simplicity and flexibility favored
in research, whereas TensorFlow provides a fuller production-ready ecosystem -
understanding these trade-offs is key for practitioners selecting the
appropriate tool. We include charts, code snippets, and more than 20 references
to academic papers and official documentation to support this comparative

Abstract: Dataset-wise heterogeneity introduces significant domain biases that
fundamentally degrade generalization on Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs),
yet this challenge remains underexplored. This paper rethink the development of
TSFMs using the paradigm of federated learning. We propose a novel Federated
Dataset Learning (FeDaL) approach to tackle heterogeneous time series by
learning dataset-agnostic temporal representations. Specifically, the
distributed architecture of federated learning is a nature solution to
decompose heterogeneous TS datasets into shared generalized knowledge and
preserved personalized knowledge. Moreover, based on the TSFM architecture,
FeDaL explicitly mitigates both local and global biases by adding two
complementary mechanisms: Domain Bias Elimination (DBE) and Global Bias
Elimination (GBE). FeDaL`s cross-dataset generalization has been extensively
evaluated in real-world datasets spanning eight tasks, including both
representation learning and downstream time series analysis, against 54
baselines. We further analyze federated scaling behavior, showing how data
volume, client count, and join rate affect model performance under
decentralization.

Abstract: The Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), proposed by Lim et al.
[\textit{International Journal of Forecasting}, 2021], is a state-of-the-art
attention-based deep neural network architecture specifically designed for
multi-horizon time series forecasting. It has demonstrated significant
performance improvements over existing benchmarks. In this work, we propose a
Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer (QTFT), a quantum-enhanced hybrid
quantum-classical architecture that extends the capabilities of the classical
TFT framework. Our results demonstrate that QTFT is successfully trained on the
forecasting datasets and is capable of accurately predicting future values. In
particular, our experimental results display that in certain test cases, the
model outperforms its classical counterpart in terms of both training and test
loss, while in the remaining cases, it achieves comparable performance. A key
advantage of our approach lies in its foundation on a variational quantum
algorithm, enabling implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum
(NISQ) devices without strict requirements on the number of qubits or circuit
depth.

Abstract: Research to improve Automated Short Answer Grading has recently focused on
Large Language Models (LLMs) with prompt engineering and no- or few-shot
prompting to achieve best results. This is in contrast to the fine-tuning
approach, which has historically required large-scale compute clusters
inaccessible to most users. New closed-model approaches such as OpenAI's
fine-tuning service promise results with as few as 100 examples, while methods
using open weights such as quantized low-rank adaptive (QLORA) can be used to
fine-tune models on consumer GPUs. We evaluate both of these fine-tuning
methods, measuring their interaction with few-shot prompting for automated
short answer grading (ASAG) with structured (JSON) outputs. Our results show
that finetuning with small amounts of data has limited utility for Llama
open-weight models, but that fine-tuning methods can outperform few-shot
baseline instruction-tuned LLMs for OpenAI's closed models. While our
evaluation set is limited, we find some evidence that the observed benefits of
finetuning may be impacted by the domain subject matter. Lastly, we observed
dramatic improvement with the LLama 3.1 8B-Instruct open-weight model by
seeding the initial training examples with a significant amount of cheaply
generated synthetic training data.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, yet most existing
methods are limited by fixed-pattern or single-target triggers, making them
inflexible and easier to detect. We propose FLAT (FL Arbitrary-Target Attack),
a novel backdoor attack that leverages a latent-driven conditional autoencoder
to generate diverse, target-specific triggers as needed. By introducing a
latent code, FLAT enables the creation of visually adaptive and highly variable
triggers, allowing attackers to select arbitrary targets without retraining and
to evade conventional detection mechanisms. Our approach unifies attack
success, stealth, and diversity within a single framework, introducing a new
level of flexibility and sophistication to backdoor attacks in FL. Extensive
experiments show that FLAT achieves high attack success and remains robust
against advanced FL defenses. These results highlight the urgent need for new
defense strategies to address latent-driven, multi-target backdoor threats in
federated settings.

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental problem in data mining and machine
learning. In recent years, multi-view clustering has attracted increasing
attention due to its ability to integrate complementary information from
multiple views. However, existing methods primarily focus on clustering
performance, while fairness-a critical concern in human-centered
applications-has been largely overlooked. Although recent studies have explored
group fairness in multi-view clustering, most methods impose explicit
regularization on cluster assignments, relying on the alignment between
sensitive attributes and the underlying cluster structure. However, this
assumption often fails in practice and can degrade clustering performance. In
this paper, we propose an adversarial fair multi-view clustering (AFMVC)
framework that integrates fairness learning into the representation learning
process. Specifically, our method employs adversarial training to fundamentally
remove sensitive attribute information from learned features, ensuring that the
resulting cluster assignments are unaffected by it. Furthermore, we
theoretically prove that aligning view-specific clustering assignments with a
fairness-invariant consensus distribution via KL divergence preserves
clustering consistency without significantly compromising fairness, thereby
providing additional theoretical guarantees for our framework. Extensive
experiments on data sets with fairness constraints demonstrate that AFMVC
achieves superior fairness and competitive clustering performance compared to
existing multi-view clustering and fairness-aware clustering methods.

Abstract: Model inversion (MI) attacks pose significant privacy risks by reconstructing
private training data from trained neural networks. While prior works have
focused on conventional unimodal DNNs, the vulnerability of vision-language
models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct the first study
to understand VLMs' vulnerability in leaking private visual training data. To
tailored for VLMs' token-based generative nature, we propose a suite of novel
token-based and sequence-based model inversion strategies. Particularly, we
propose Token-based Model Inversion (TMI), Convergent Token-based Model
Inversion (TMI-C), Sequence-based Model Inversion (SMI), and Sequence-based
Model Inversion with Adaptive Token Weighting (SMI-AW). Through extensive
experiments and user study on three state-of-the-art VLMs and multiple
datasets, we demonstrate, for the first time, that VLMs are susceptible to
training data leakage. The experiments show that our proposed sequence-based
methods, particularly SMI-AW combined with a logit-maximization loss based on
vocabulary representation, can achieve competitive reconstruction and
outperform token-based methods in attack accuracy and visual similarity.
Importantly, human evaluation of the reconstructed images yields an attack
accuracy of 75.31\%, underscoring the severity of model inversion threats in
VLMs. Notably we also demonstrate inversion attacks on the publicly released
VLMs. Our study reveals the privacy vulnerability of VLMs as they become
increasingly popular across many applications such as healthcare and finance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving tasks. Recently, the
introduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging
rule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions
and guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across
many replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses
under a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or
incorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to
vanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for
learning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.
To address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization
framework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome
consistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs
show high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives
meaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and
self-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we
incorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances
local advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic
transitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method
introduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization
strategy. We validate its effectiveness through substantial performance gains
on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, highlighting the proposed
framework's robustness and general applicability. Code of this work has been
released at https://github.com/hijih/copo-code.git.

Abstract: Accurate solar generation prediction is essential for proper estimation of
renewable energy resources across diverse geographic locations. However,
geographical and weather features vary from location to location which
introduces domain shift - a major bottleneck to develop location-agnostic
prediction model. As a result, a machine-learning model which can perform well
to predict solar power in one location, may exhibit subpar performance in
another location. Moreover, the lack of properly labeled data and storage
issues make the task even more challenging. In order to address domain shift
due to varying weather conditions across different meteorological regions, this
paper presents a semi-supervised deep domain adaptation framework, allowing
accurate predictions with minimal labeled data from the target location. Our
approach involves training a deep convolutional neural network on a source
location's data and adapting it to the target location using a source-free,
teacher-student model configuration. The teacher-student model leverages
consistency and cross-entropy loss for semi-supervised learning, ensuring
effective adaptation without any source data requirement for prediction. With
annotation of only $20 \%$ data in the target domain, our approach exhibits an
improvement upto $11.36 \%$, $6.65 \%$, $4.92\%$ for California, Florida and
New York as target domain, respectively in terms of accuracy in predictions
with respect to non-adaptive approach.

Abstract: A common approach to the \emph{de novo} molecular generation problem from
mass spectra involves a two-stage pipeline: (1) encoding mass spectra into
molecular fingerprints, followed by (2) decoding these fingerprints into
molecular structures. In our work, we adopt
\textsc{MIST}~\citep{MISTgoldmanAnnotatingMetaboliteMass2023} as the encoder
and \textsc{MolForge}~\citep{ucakReconstructionLosslessMolecular2023} as the
decoder, leveraging pretraining to enhance performance. Notably, pretraining
\textsc{MolForge} proves especially effective, enabling it to serve as a robust
fingerprint-to-structure decoder. Additionally, instead of passing the
probability of each bit in the fingerprint, thresholding the probabilities as a
step function helps focus the decoder on the presence of substructures,
improving recovery of accurate molecular structures even when the fingerprints
predicted by \textsc{MIST} only moderately resembles the ground truth in terms
of Tanimoto similarity. This combination of encoder and decoder results in a
tenfold improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, generating top-1
28\% / top-10 36\% of molecular structures correctly from mass spectra. We
position this pipeline as a strong baseline for future research in \emph{de
novo} molecule elucidation from mass spectra.

Abstract: The training of deep neural networks is inherently a nonconvex optimization
problem, yet standard approaches such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
require simultaneous updates to all parameters, often leading to unstable
convergence and high computational cost. To address these issues, we propose a
novel method, Stochastic Alternating Minimization with Trainable Step Sizes
(SAMT), which updates network parameters in an alternating manner by treating
the weights of each layer as a block. By decomposing the overall optimization
into sub-problems corresponding to different blocks, this block-wise
alternating strategy reduces per-step computational overhead and enhances
training stability in nonconvex settings. To fully leverage these benefits,
inspired by meta-learning, we proposed a novel adaptive step size strategy to
incorporate into the sub-problem solving steps of alternating updates. It
supports different types of trainable step sizes, including but not limited to
scalar, element-wise, row-wise, and column-wise, enabling adaptive step size
selection tailored to each block via meta-learning. We further provide a
theoretical convergence guarantee for the proposed algorithm, establishing its
optimization soundness. Extensive experiments for multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that SAMT achieves better generalization performance with fewer
parameter updates compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its
effectiveness and potential in neural network optimization.

Abstract: External reasoning systems combine language models with process reward models
(PRMs) to select high-quality reasoning paths for complex tasks such as
mathematical problem solving. However, these systems are prone to reward
hacking, where high-scoring but logically incorrect paths are assigned high
scores by the PRMs, leading to incorrect answers. From a causal inference
perspective, we attribute this phenomenon primarily to the presence of
confounding semantic features. To address it, we propose Causal Reward
Adjustment (CRA), a method that mitigates reward hacking by estimating the true
reward of a reasoning path. CRA trains sparse autoencoders on the PRM's
internal activations to recover interpretable features, then corrects
confounding by using backdoor adjustment. Experiments on math solving datasets
demonstrate that CRA mitigates reward hacking and improves final accuracy,
without modifying the policy model or retraining PRM.

Abstract: This paper introduces symmetric divergences to behavior regularization policy
optimization (BRPO) to establish a novel offline RL framework. Existing methods
focus on asymmetric divergences such as KL to obtain analytic regularized
policies and a practical minimization objective. We show that symmetric
divergences do not permit an analytic policy as regularization and can incur
numerical issues as loss. We tackle these challenges by the Taylor series of
$f$-divergence. Specifically, we prove that an analytic policy can be obtained
with a finite series. For loss, we observe that symmetric divergences can be
decomposed into an asymmetry and a conditional symmetry term, Taylor-expanding
the latter alleviates numerical issues. Summing together, we propose Symmetric
$f$ Actor-Critic (S$f$-AC), the first practical BRPO algorithm with symmetric
divergences. Experimental results on distribution approximation and MuJoCo
verify that S$f$-AC performs competitively.

approaches focus on automating feature engineering and model architecture
search, recent studies in time series forecasting suggest that lightweight

to explore improving data quality, rather than model architecture, as a
potentially fruitful direction for AutoML on time series data. We propose
DCATS, a Data-Centric Agent for Time Series. DCATS leverages metadata
accompanying time series to clean data while optimizing forecasting
performance. We evaluated DCATS using four time series forecasting models on a
large-scale traffic volume forecasting dataset. Results demonstrate that DCATS
achieves an average 6% error reduction across all tested models and time
horizons, highlighting the potential of data-centric approaches in AutoML for

Abstract: Angle estimation is an important step in the Doppler ultrasound clinical
workflow to measure blood velocity. It is widely recognized that incorrect
angle estimation is a leading cause of error in Doppler-based blood velocity
measurements. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for
automated Doppler angle estimation. The approach was developed using 2100 human
carotid ultrasound images including image augmentation. Five pre-trained models
were used to extract images features, and these features were passed to a
custom shallow network for Doppler angle estimation. Independently,
measurements were obtained by a human observer reviewing the images for
comparison. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the automated and manual
angle estimates ranged from 3.9{\deg} to 9.4{\deg} for the models evaluated.
Furthermore, the MAE for the best performing model was less than the acceptable
clinical Doppler angle error threshold thus avoiding misclassification of
normal velocity values as a stenosis. The results demonstrate potential for
applying a deep-learning based technique for automated ultrasound Doppler angle
estimation. Such a technique could potentially be implemented within the
imaging software on commercial ultrasound scanners.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) seeks to model temporal dynamics
among variables to predict future trends. Transformer-based models and large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their ability to capture
long-range dependencies and patterns. However, current methods often rely on
rigid inductive biases, ignore intervariable interactions, or apply static
fusion strategies that limit adaptability across forecast horizons. These
limitations create bottlenecks in capturing nuanced, horizon-specific
relationships in time-series data. To solve this problem, we propose T3Time, a
novel trimodal framework consisting of time, spectral, and prompt branches,
where the dedicated frequency encoding branch captures the periodic structures
along with a gating mechanism that learns prioritization between temporal and
spectral features based on the prediction horizon. We also proposed a mechanism
which adaptively aggregates multiple cross-modal alignment heads by dynamically
weighting the importance of each head based on the features. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average reduction of 3.28%
in MSE and 2.29% in MAE. Furthermore, it shows strong generalization in
few-shot learning settings: with 5% training data, we see a reduction in MSE
and MAE by 4.13% and 1.91%, respectively; and with 10% data, by 3.62% and 1.98%
on average. Code - https://github.com/monaf-chowdhury/T3Time/

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now being used with increasing frequency as
chat bots, tasked with the summarizing information or generating text and code
in accordance with user instructions. The rapid increase in reasoning
capabilities and inference speed of LLMs has revealed their remarkable
potential for applications extending beyond the domain of chat bots to general
machine learning tasks. This work is conducted out of the curiosity about such
potential. In this work, we propose a framework Mockingbird to adapt LLMs to
general machine learning tasks and evaluate its performance and scalability on
several general machine learning tasks. The core concept of this framework is
instructing LLMs to role-play functions and reflect on its mistakes to improve
itself. Our evaluation and analysis result shows that LLM-driven machine
learning methods, such as Mockingbird, can achieve acceptable results on common
machine learning tasks; however, solely reflecting on its own currently cannot
outperform the effect of domain-specific documents and feedback from human
experts.

Abstract: Interactive multimodal agents must convert raw visual observations into
coherent sequences of language-conditioned actions -- a capability that current
vision-language models (VLMs) still lack. Earlier reinforcement-learning (RL)
efforts could, in principle, endow VLMs with such skills, but they have seldom
tested whether the learned behaviours generalize beyond their training
simulators, and they depend either on brittle hyperparameter tuning or on
dense-reward environments with low state variability. We introduce
Vision-Language Decoupled Actor-Critic (VL-DAC), a lightweight,
hyperparameter-free RL algorithm. VL-DAC applies PPO updates to action tokens
while learning value only at the environment-step level: an arrangement, to our
knowledge, not previously explored for large VLMs or LLMs. This simple
decoupling removes unstable weighting terms and yields faster, more reliable
convergence. Training a single VLM with VL-DAC in one inexpensive simulator at
a time (MiniWorld, Gym-Cards, ALFWorld, or WebShop) already produces policies
that generalize widely: +50\% relative on BALROG (game-centric agentic
control), +5\% relative on the hardest part of VSI-Bench (spatial planning),
and +2\% on VisualWebBench (web navigation), all without degrading general
image understanding accuracy. These results provide the first evidence that a
simple RL algorithm can train VLMs entirely in cheap synthetic worlds while
delivering measurable gains on real-image agentic, spatial-reasoning, and
web-navigation benchmarks.

Abstract: Machine unlearning, the efficient deletion of the impact of specific data in
a trained model, remains a challenging problem. Current machine unlearning
approaches that focus primarily on data-centric or weight-based strategies
frequently encounter challenges in achieving precise unlearning, maintaining
stability, and ensuring applicability across diverse domains. In this work, we
introduce a new two-phase efficient machine unlearning method for image
classification, in terms of weight saliency, leveraging weight saliency to
focus the unlearning process on critical model parameters. Our method is called
weight saliency soft-guided contrastive learning for efficient machine
unlearning image classification (WSS-CL), which significantly narrows the
performance gap with "exact" unlearning. First, the forgetting stage maximizes
kullback-leibler divergence between output logits and aggregated pseudo-labels
for efficient forgetting in logit space. Next, the adversarial fine-tuning
stage introduces contrastive learning in a self-supervised manner. By using
scaled feature representations, it maximizes the distance between the forgotten
and retained data samples in the feature space, with the forgotten and the
paired augmented samples acting as positive pairs, while the retained samples
act as negative pairs in the contrastive loss computation. Experimental
evaluations reveal that our proposed method yields much-improved unlearning
efficacy with negligible performance loss compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, indicative of its usability in supervised and self-supervised

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) plays a critical role for pretrained large
language models (LLMs), notably enhancing their capacity to acquire
domain-specific knowledge while preserving or potentially augmenting their
general-purpose capabilities. However, the efficacy of SFT hinges on data
quality as well as data volume, otherwise it may result in limited performance
gains or even degradation relative to the associated baselines. To mitigate
such reliance, we suggest categorizing tokens within each corpus into two parts
-- positive and negative tokens -- based on whether they are useful to improve
model performance. Positive tokens can be trained in common ways, whereas
negative tokens, which may lack essential semantics or be misleading, should be
explicitly forgotten. Overall, the token categorization facilitate the model to
learn less informative message, and the forgetting process shapes a knowledge
boundary to guide the model on what information to learn more precisely. We
conduct experiments on well-established benchmarks, finding that this
forgetting mechanism not only improves overall model performance and also
facilitate more diverse model responses.

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: Cloud-based Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) raises serious privacy
concerns when handling sensitive client data. Existing Private Inference (PI)
methods face a fundamental trade-off between privacy and efficiency:
cryptographic approaches offer strong protection but incur high computational
overhead, while efficient alternatives such as split inference expose
intermediate features to inversion attacks. We propose PrivDFS, a new paradigm
for private inference that replaces a single exposed representation with
distributed feature sharing. PrivDFS partitions input features on the client
into multiple balanced shares, which are distributed to non-colluding,
non-communicating servers for independent partial inference. The client
securely aggregates the servers' outputs to reconstruct the final prediction,
ensuring that no single server observes sufficient information to compromise
input privacy. To further strengthen privacy, we propose two key extensions:
PrivDFS-AT, which uses adversarial training with a diffusion-based proxy
attacker to enforce inversion-resistant feature partitioning, and PrivDFS-KD,
which leverages user-specific keys to diversify partitioning policies and
prevent query-based inversion generalization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and
CelebA demonstrate that PrivDFS achieves privacy comparable to deep split
inference while cutting client computation by up to 100 times with no accuracy
loss, and that the extensions remain robust against both diffusion-based
in-distribution and adaptive attacks.

Abstract: Modeling the evolution of high-dimensional systems from limited snapshot
observations at irregular time points poses a significant challenge in
quantitative biology and related fields. Traditional approaches often rely on
dimensionality reduction techniques, which can oversimplify the dynamics and
fail to capture critical transient behaviors in non-equilibrium systems. We
present Multi-Marginal Stochastic Flow Matching (MMSFM), a novel extension of
simulation-free score and flow matching methods to the multi-marginal setting,
enabling the alignment of high-dimensional data measured at non-equidistant
time points without reducing dimensionality. The use of measure-valued splines
enhances robustness to irregular snapshot timing, and score matching prevents
overfitting in high-dimensional spaces. We validate our framework on several
synthetic and benchmark datasets, including gene expression data collected at
uneven time points and an image progression task, demonstrating the method's
versatility.

Abstract: The dynamic environment of laboratories and clinics, with streams of data
arriving on a daily basis, requires regular updates of trained machine learning
models for consistent performance. Continual learning is supposed to help train
models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are
ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in
single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection).
Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to
MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from
various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance
from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and
instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the
diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a
leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class
incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We
show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the
adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those
caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance but entail
significant memory and computational costs, restricting their practical
deployment. While existing INT4/INT8 quantization reduces these costs, they
often degrade accuracy or lack optimal efficiency. INT6 quantization offers a
superior trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency, but lacks
hardware support in modern GPUs, forcing emulation via higher-precision
arithmetic units that limit acceleration.
  In this paper, we propose FlexQ, a novel post-training INT6 quantization
framework combining algorithmic innovation with system-level optimizations.
FlexQ employs uniform 6-bit weight quantization across all layers, with
adaptive retention of 8-bit activations in layers identified through layer-wise
sensitivity analysis. To maximize hardware efficiency, we develop a specialized
high-performance GPU kernel supporting matrix multiplication for W6A6 and W6A8
representations via Binary Tensor Core (BTC) equivalents, effectively bypassing
the lack of native INT6 tensor cores. Evaluations on LLaMA models show FlexQ
maintains near-FP16 accuracy, with perplexity increases of no more than 0.05.
The proposed kernel achieves an average 1.39$\times$ speedup over ABQ-LLM on
LLaMA-2-70B linear layers. End-to-end, FlexQ delivers 1.33$\times$ inference
acceleration and 1.21$\times$ memory savings over SmoothQuant. Code is released

Abstract: Multimodal learning has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years,
particularly with the integration of attention-based models, leading to
significant performance gains across a variety of tasks. Parallel to this
progress, the demand for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has spurred
a growing body of research aimed at interpreting the complex decision-making
processes of these models. This systematic literature review analyzes research
published between January 2020 and early 2024 that focuses on the
explainability of multimodal models. Framed within the broader goals of XAI, we
examine the literature across multiple dimensions, including model
architecture, modalities involved, explanation algorithms and evaluation
methodologies. Our analysis reveals that the majority of studies are
concentrated on vision-language and language-only models, with attention-based
techniques being the most commonly employed for explanation. However, these
methods often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of interactions between
modalities, a challenge further compounded by the architectural heterogeneity
across domains. Importantly, we find that evaluation methods for XAI in
multimodal settings are largely non-systematic, lacking consistency,
robustness, and consideration for modality-specific cognitive and contextual
factors. Based on these findings, we provide a comprehensive set of
recommendations aimed at promoting rigorous, transparent, and standardized
evaluation and reporting practices in multimodal XAI research. Our goal is to
support future research in more interpretable, accountable, and responsible
mulitmodal AI systems, with explainability at their core.

Abstract: We introduce Cloud Model Characteristic Function Auto-Encoder (CMCFAE), a
novel generative model that integrates the cloud model into the Wasserstein
Auto-Encoder (WAE) framework. By leveraging the characteristic functions of the
cloud model to regularize the latent space, our approach enables more accurate
modeling of complex data distributions. Unlike conventional methods that rely
on a standard Gaussian prior and traditional divergence measures, our method
employs a cloud model prior, providing a more flexible and realistic
representation of the latent space, thus mitigating the homogenization observed
in reconstructed samples. We derive the characteristic function of the cloud
model and propose a corresponding regularizer within the WAE framework.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on MNIST, FashionMNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CelebA demonstrate that CMCFAE outperforms existing models in
terms of reconstruction quality, latent space structuring, and sample
diversity. This work not only establishes a novel integration of cloud model
theory with MMD-based regularization but also offers a promising new
perspective for enhancing autoencoder-based generative models.

Abstract: Red teaming is critical for identifying vulnerabilities and building trust in
current LLMs. However, current automated methods for Large Language Models
(LLMs) rely on brittle prompt templates or single-turn attacks, failing to
capture the complex, interactive nature of real-world adversarial dialogues. We
propose a novel paradigm: training an AI to strategically `break' another AI.
By formalizing red teaming as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employing a
hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we effectively address the
inherent sparse reward and long-horizon challenges. Our generative agent learns
coherent, multi-turn attack strategies through a fine-grained, token-level harm
reward, enabling it to uncover subtle vulnerabilities missed by existing
baselines. This approach sets a new state-of-the-art, fundamentally reframing
LLM red teaming as a dynamic, trajectory-based process (rather than a one-step
test) essential for robust AI deployment.

Abstract: The rapid progress seen in terms of large-scale generative AI is largely
based on the attention mechanism. It is conversely non-trivial to conceive
small-scale applications for which attention-based architectures outperform
traditional approaches, such as multi-layer perceptrons or recurrent networks.
We examine this problem in the context of 'task switching'. In this framework
models work on ongoing token sequences with the current task being determined
by stochastically interspersed control tokens. We show that standard
transformers cannot solve a basic task switching reference model based on
finite domain arithmetics which contains subtasks dedicated to increment /
addition / reverse copy / context (IARC). We show that transformers, long
short-term memory recurrent networks (LSTM), and plain multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) achieve similar, but only modest prediction accuracies. We enlarge our
comparative study by including an extension of the standard transformer
architecture to its non-translational invariant counterpart, the cisformer, and
an alternative attention mechanism, extensive attention. A combination of the
latter is found to be the only model able to achieve considerable performance
levels, of around 95%. Our results indicate that the workings of attention can
be understood better, and even improved, when comparing qualitatively different
formulations in task-switching settings.

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD), where an extra draft model first provides multiple
draft tokens and the original target model then verifies these tokens in
parallel, has shown great power for LLM inference acceleration. However,
existing SD methods must adhere to the 'draft-then-verify' paradigm, which
forces drafting and verification processes to execute sequentially during SD,
resulting in inefficient inference performance and limiting the size of the
draft model. Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is
rejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be
discarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we
propose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a
'query-and-correct' paradigm. Specifically, CARD decouples drafting and
verification: the draft model generates candidate tokens to populate a shared
cache, while the target model concurrently rectifies the draft model's
generation direction. This effectively enables the target model to perform
inference at speed approaching that of the draft model. Our approach achieves
up to 4.83 speedup over vanilla decoding without requiring fine-tuning of
either the draft or target models. Our code is available at

Abstract: Transformer-based neural operators have emerged as promising surrogate
solvers for partial differential equations, by leveraging the effectiveness of
Transformers for capturing long-range dependencies and global correlations,
profoundly proven in language modeling. However, existing methodologies
overlook the coordinated learning of interdependencies between local physical
details and global features, which are essential for tackling multiscale
problems, preserving physical consistency and numerical stability in long-term
rollouts, and accurately capturing transitional dynamics. In this work, we
propose GFocal, a Transformer-based neural operator method that enforces
simultaneous global and local feature learning and fusion. Global correlations
and local features are harnessed through Nystr\"{o}m attention-based
\textbf{g}lobal blocks and slices-based \textbf{focal} blocks to generate
physics-aware tokens, subsequently modulated and integrated via
convolution-based gating blocks, enabling dynamic fusion of multiscale
information. GFocal achieves accurate modeling and prediction of physical
features given arbitrary geometries and initial conditions. Experiments show
that GFocal achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 15.2\%
relative gain in five out of six benchmarks and also excels in industry-scale
simulations such as aerodynamics simulation of automotives and airfoils.

Abstract: Lately, Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a prevalent
paradigm to deliver personalized models by collaboratively training while
simultaneously adapting to each client's local applications. Existing PFL
methods typically face a significant challenge due to the ubiquitous data
heterogeneity (i.e., non-IID data) across clients, which severely hinders
convergence and degrades performance. We identify that the root issue lies in
the long-standing reliance on gradient-based updates, which are inherently
sensitive to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue and bridge the
research gap, in this paper, we propose a Heterogeneity-invariant Personalized
Federated learning scheme, named FedHiP, through analytical (i.e., closed-form)
solutions to avoid gradient-based updates. Specifically, we exploit the trend
of self-supervised pre-training, leveraging a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for gradient-free feature extraction. Following the feature extractor,
we further develop an analytic classifier for gradient-free training. To
support both collective generalization and individual personalization, our
FedHiP scheme incorporates three phases: analytic local training, analytic
global aggregation, and analytic local personalization. The closed-form
solutions of our FedHiP scheme enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, meaning that each personalized model remains identical regardless
of how non-IID the data are distributed across all other clients. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our FedHiP
scheme, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines by at least 5.79%-20.97%
in accuracy.

Abstract: Reducing domestic energy demand is central to climate mitigation and fuel
poverty strategies, yet the impact of energy efficiency interventions is highly
heterogeneous. Using a causal machine learning model trained on nationally
representative data of the English housing stock, we estimate average and
conditional treatment effects of wall insulation on gas consumption, focusing
on distributional effects across energy burden subgroups. While interventions
reduce gas demand on average (by as much as 19 percent), low energy burden
groups achieve substantial savings, whereas those experiencing high energy
burdens see little to no reduction. This pattern reflects a
behaviourally-driven mechanism: households constrained by high costs-to-income
ratios (e.g. more than 0.1) reallocate savings toward improved thermal comfort
rather than lowering consumption. Far from wasteful, such responses represent
rational adjustments in contexts of prior deprivation, with potential
co-benefits for health and well-being. These findings call for a broader
evaluation framework that accounts for both climate impacts and the equity
implications of domestic energy policy.

Abstract: A common use of machine learning (ML) models is predicting the class of a
sample. Object detection is an extension of classification that includes
localization of the object via a bounding box within the sample.
Classification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by
counting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the
ground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as
equivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy
with a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or
operator valuation of misclassifications. When such a hierarchical structure
exists, hierarchical scoring metrics can return the model performance of a
given prediction related to the distance between the prediction and the ground
truth label. Such metrics can be viewed as giving partial credit to predictions
instead of pass/fail, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the impact of
misclassifications. This work develops hierarchical scoring metrics varying in
complexity that utilize scoring trees to encode relationships between class
labels and produce metrics that reflect distance in the scoring tree. The
scoring metrics are demonstrated on an abstract use case with scoring trees
that represent three weighting strategies and evaluated by the kind of errors
discouraged. Results demonstrate that these metrics capture errors with finer
granularity and the scoring trees enable tuning. This work demonstrates an
approach to evaluating ML performance that ranks models not only by how many
errors are made but by the kind or impact of errors. Python implementations of
the scoring metrics will be available in an open-source repository at time of
publication.

Abstract: While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, they struggle with
robust causal reasoning, often relying on spurious correlations and brittle
patterns. Similarly, traditional Reinforcement Learning agents also lack causal
understanding, optimizing for rewards without modeling why actions lead to
outcomes. We introduce Causal Reflection, a framework that explicitly models
causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation,
enabling agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects. Additionally, we
define a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted
and observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's
internal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners,
but as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into
natural language explanations and counterfactuals. Our framework lays the
theoretical groundwork for Causal Reflective agents that can adapt,
self-correct, and communicate causal understanding in evolving environments.

Abstract: Multivariate time-series classification is pivotal in domains ranging from

Transformer- and CNN-based models often remain computationally heavy, offer
limited frequency diversity, and require extensive parameter budgets. We
propose PRISM (Per-channel Resolution-Informed Symmetric Module), a
convolutional-based feature extractor that applies symmetric
finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters at multiple temporal scales,
independently per channel. This multi-resolution, per-channel design yields
highly frequency-selective embeddings without any inter-channel convolutions,
greatly reducing model size and complexity. Across human-activity, sleep-stage
and biomedical benchmarks, PRISM, paired with lightweight classification heads,
matches or outperforms leading CNN and Transformer baselines, while using
roughly an order of magnitude fewer parameters and FLOPs. By uniting classical
signal processing insights with modern deep learning, PRISM offers an accurate,
resource-efficient solution for multivariate time-series classification.

Abstract: In recent years, traffic prediction has achieved remarkable success and has
become an integral component of intelligent transportation systems. However,
traffic data is typically distributed among multiple data owners, and privacy
constraints prevent the direct utilization of these isolated datasets for
traffic prediction. Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on
designing communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information
from other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such
approaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting
transmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume
of traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical,
making the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for
federated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP).
Unlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client
communication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate
predictions using only local information. Based on the CIP, we further develop
Fed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to
process its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information
loss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients. Fed-CI
significantly reduces communication overhead, accelerates the training process,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance while complying with privacy
regulations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate
that Fed-CI consistently outperforms existing methods across all datasets and
federated settings. It achieves improvements of 8%, 14%, and 16% in RMSE, MAE,
and MAPE, respectively, while also substantially reducing communication costs.

Abstract: It is difficult for individuals and organizations to protect personal
information without a fundamental understanding of relative privacy risks. By
analyzing over 5,000 empirical identity theft and fraud cases, this research
identifies which types of personal data are exposed, how frequently exposures
occur, and what the consequences of those exposures are. We construct an
Identity Ecosystem graph--a foundational, graph-based model in which nodes
represent personally identifiable information (PII) attributes and edges
represent empirical disclosure relationships between them (e.g., the
probability that one PII attribute is exposed due to the exposure of another).
Leveraging this graph structure, we develop a privacy risk prediction framework
that uses graph theory and graph neural networks to estimate the likelihood of
further disclosures when certain PII attributes are compromised. The results
show that our approach effectively answers the core question: Can the
disclosure of a given identity attribute possibly lead to the disclosure of
another attribute?

Abstract: This work focuses on training graph foundation models (GFMs) that have strong
generalization ability in graph-level tasks such as graph classification.
Effective GFM training requires capturing information consistent across
different domains. We discover that graph structures provide more consistent
cross-domain information compared to node features and graph labels. However,
traditional GFMs primarily focus on transferring node features from various
domains into a unified representation space but often lack structural
cross-domain generalization. To address this, we introduce GraphProp, which
emphasizes structural generalization. The training process of GraphProp
consists of two main phases. First, we train a structural GFM by predicting
graph invariants. Since graph invariants are properties of graphs that depend
only on the abstract structure, not on particular labellings or drawings of the
graph, this structural GFM has a strong ability to capture the abstract
structural information and provide discriminative graph representations
comparable across diverse domains. In the second phase, we use the
representations given by the structural GFM as positional encodings to train a
comprehensive GFM. This phase utilizes domain-specific node attributes and
graph labels to further improve cross-domain node feature generalization. Our
experiments demonstrate that GraphProp significantly outperforms the
competitors in supervised learning and few-shot learning, especially in
handling graphs without node attributes.

Abstract: Resistance spot welding is the dominant joining process for the body-in-white
in the automotive industry, where the weld nugget diameter is the key quality
metric. Its measurement requires destructive testing, limiting the potential
for efficient quality control. Physics-informed neural networks were
investigated as a promising tool to reconstruct internal process states from
experimental data, enabling model-based and non-invasive quality assessment in
aluminum spot welding. A major challenge is the integration of real-world data
into the network due to competing optimization objectives. To address this, we
introduce two novel training strategies. First, experimental losses for dynamic
displacement and nugget diameter are progressively included using a fading-in
function to prevent excessive optimization conflicts. We also implement a
custom learning rate scheduler and early stopping based on a rolling window to
counteract premature reduction due to increased loss magnitudes. Second, we
introduce a conditional update of temperature-dependent material parameters via
a look-up table, activated only after a loss threshold is reached to ensure
physically meaningful temperatures. An axially symmetric two-dimensional model
was selected to represent the welding process accurately while maintaining
computational efficiency. To reduce computational burden, the training
strategies and model components were first systematically evaluated in one
dimension, enabling controlled analysis of loss design and contact models. The
two-dimensional network predicts dynamic displacement and nugget growth within
the experimental confidence interval, supports transferring welding stages from
steel to aluminum, and demonstrates strong potential for fast, model-based
quality control in industrial applications.

Abstract: We propose a framework for learning maps between probability distributions
that broadly generalizes the time dynamics of flow and diffusion models. To
enable this, we generalize stochastic interpolants by replacing the scalar time
variable with vectors, matrices, or linear operators, allowing us to bridge
probability distributions across multiple dimensional spaces. This approach
enables the construction of versatile generative models capable of fulfilling
multiple tasks without task-specific training. Our operator-based interpolants
not only provide a unifying theoretical perspective for existing generative
models but also extend their capabilities. Through numerical experiments, we
demonstrate the zero-shot efficacy of our method on conditional generation and
inpainting, fine-tuning and posterior sampling, and multiscale modeling,
suggesting its potential as a generic task-agnostic alternative to specialized
models.

Abstract: Inspired by the brain's hierarchical processing and energy efficiency, this
paper presents a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture for lifelong Network
Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). The proposed system first employs an
efficient static SNN to identify potential intrusions, which then activates an
adaptive dynamic SNN responsible for classifying the specific attack type.
Mimicking biological adaptation, the dynamic classifier utilizes Grow When
Required (GWR)-inspired structural plasticity and a novel Adaptive
Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (Ad-STDP) learning rule. These bio-plausible
mechanisms enable the network to learn new threats incrementally while
preserving existing knowledge. Tested on the UNSW-NB15 benchmark in a continual
learning setting, the architecture demonstrates robust adaptation, reduced
catastrophic forgetting, and achieves $85.3$\% overall accuracy. Furthermore,
simulations using the Intel Lava framework confirm high operational sparsity,
highlighting the potential for low-power deployment on neuromorphic hardware.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection has garnered considerable attention across
diverse domains. While existing methods often fail to capture the underlying
mechanisms behind anomaly generation in time series data. In addition, time
series anomaly detection often faces several data-related inherent challenges,
i.e., label scarcity, data imbalance, and complex multi-periodicity. In this
paper, we leverage causal tools and introduce a new causality-based framework,
CaPulse, which tunes in to the underlying causal pulse of time series data to
effectively detect anomalies. Concretely, we begin by building a structural
causal model to decipher the generation processes behind anomalies. To tackle
the challenges posed by the data, we propose Periodical Normalizing Flows with
a novel mask mechanism and carefully designed periodical learners, creating a
periodicity-aware, density-based anomaly detection approach. Extensive
experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that CaPulse consistently
outperforms existing methods, achieving AUROC improvements of 3% to 17%, with
enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: Link Prediction (LP) is a critical task in graph machine learning. While
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced LP performance
recently, existing methods face key challenges including limited supervision
from sparse connectivity, sensitivity to initialization, and poor
generalization under distribution shifts. We explore pretraining as a solution
to address these challenges. Unlike node classification, LP is inherently a
pairwise task, which requires the integration of both node- and edge-level
information. In this work, we present the first systematic study on the
transferability of these distinct modules and propose a late fusion strategy to
effectively combine their outputs for improved performance. To handle the
diversity of pretraining data and avoid negative transfer, we introduce a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that captures distinct patterns in separate
experts, facilitating seamless application of the pretrained model on diverse
downstream datasets. For fast adaptation, we develop a parameter-efficient
tuning strategy that allows the pretrained model to adapt to unseen datasets
with minimal computational overhead. Experiments on 16 datasets across two
domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on low-resource link prediction while obtaining
competitive results compared to end-to-end trained methods, with over 10,000x
lower computational overhead.

Abstract: Perch is a performant pre-trained model for bioacoustics. It was trained in
supervised fashion, providing both off-the-shelf classification scores for
thousands of vocalizing species as well as strong embeddings for transfer
learning. In this new release, Perch 2.0, we expand from training exclusively
on avian species to a large multi-taxa dataset. The model is trained with
self-distillation using a prototype-learning classifier as well as a new
source-prediction training criterion. Perch 2.0 obtains state-of-the-art
performance on the BirdSet and BEANS benchmarks. It also outperforms
specialized marine models on marine transfer learning tasks, despite having
almost no marine training data. We present hypotheses as to why fine-grained
species classification is a particularly robust pre-training task for
bioacoustics.

Abstract: We consider the basic problem of learning Single-Index Models with respect to
the square loss under the Gaussian distribution in the presence of adversarial
label noise. Our main contribution is the first computationally efficient
algorithm for this learning task, achieving a constant factor approximation,
that succeeds for the class of {\em all} monotone activations with bounded
moment of order $2 + \zeta,$ for $\zeta > 0.$ This class in particular includes
all monotone Lipschitz functions and even discontinuous functions like
(possibly biased) halfspaces. Prior work for the case of unknown activation
either does not attain constant factor approximation or succeeds for a
substantially smaller family of activations. The main conceptual novelty of our
approach lies in developing an optimization framework that steps outside the
boundaries of usual gradient methods and instead identifies a useful vector
field to guide the algorithm updates by directly leveraging the problem
structure, properties of Gaussian spaces, and regularity of monotone functions.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing actions
present fundamentally distinct governance challenges compared to traditional AI
models. Unlike conventional AI, these systems exhibit emergent and unexpected
behaviors during runtime, introducing novel agent-related risks that cannot be
fully anticipated through pre-deployment governance alone. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MI9, the first fully integrated runtime governance
framework designed specifically for safety and alignment of agentic AI systems.
MI9 introduces real-time controls through six integrated components:
agency-risk index, agent-semantic telemetry capture, continuous authorization
monitoring, Finite-State-Machine (FSM)-based conformance engines,
goal-conditioned drift detection, and graduated containment strategies.
Operating transparently across heterogeneous agent architectures, MI9 enables
the systematic, safe, and responsible deployment of agentic systems in
production environments where conventional governance approaches fall short,
providing the foundational infrastructure for safe agentic AI deployment at
scale. Detailed analysis through a diverse set of scenarios demonstrates MI9's
systematic coverage of governance challenges that existing approaches fail to
address, establishing the technical foundation for comprehensive agentic AI
oversight.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on multimodal large language models exhibit
strong collaboration and performance. However, their growing openness and
interaction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial
attacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as
dedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this
paradigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection,
and (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised,
system-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents
further raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose
Evo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that
enables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than
relying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to
simultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats,
ensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure.
Furthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing
reinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial
training paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS
performance under co-evolving threats. Experiments show that Evo-MARL reduces
attack success rates by up to 22% while boosting accuracy by up to 5% on
reasoning tasks-demonstrating that safety and utility can be jointly improved.

Abstract: Designing effective algorithmic components remains a fundamental obstacle in
tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), where solvers
often rely on carefully hand-crafted strategies. Despite recent advances in
using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most
approaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic
scoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this
paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy
optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent
components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose
Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a
novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based
optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one
component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior
updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This
structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the
discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions. Experiments across multiple
COP domains show that MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting the promise of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for fully
automated solver design.

Abstract: Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration
dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge
in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language
Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer
interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is
still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning
over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic
regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior
efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set
of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified
framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop
symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators.
Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models,
highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment,
and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.

Abstract: We observe that MLRMs oriented toward human-centric service are highly
susceptible to user emotional cues during the deep-thinking stage, often
overriding safety protocols or built-in safety checks under high emotional
intensity. Inspired by this key insight, we propose EmoAgent, an autonomous
adversarial emotion-agent framework that orchestrates exaggerated affective
prompts to hijack reasoning pathways. Even when visual risks are correctly
identified, models can still produce harmful completions through emotional
misalignment. We further identify persistent high-risk failure modes in
transparent deep-thinking scenarios, such as MLRMs generating harmful reasoning
masked behind seemingly safe responses. These failures expose misalignments
between internal inference and surface-level behavior, eluding existing
content-based safeguards. To quantify these risks, we introduce three metrics:
(1) Risk-Reasoning Stealth Score (RRSS) for harmful reasoning beneath benign
outputs; (2) Risk-Visual Neglect Rate (RVNR) for unsafe completions despite
visual risk recognition; and (3) Refusal Attitude Inconsistency (RAIC) for
evaluating refusal unstability under prompt variants. Extensive experiments on
advanced MLRMs demonstrate the effectiveness of EmoAgent and reveal deeper
emotional cognitive misalignments in model safety behavior.

Abstract: Intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) such as Siri and Google Assistant are
designed to enhance human capabilities and perform tasks on behalf of users.
The emergence of LLM agents brings new opportunities for the development of
IPAs. While responsive capabilities have been widely studied, proactive
behaviors remain underexplored. Designing an IPA that is proactive,
privacy-preserving, and capable of self-evolution remains a significant
challenge. Designing such IPAs relies on the cognitive architecture of LLM
agents. This work proposes Cognition Forest, a semantic structure designed to
align cognitive modeling with system-level design. We unify cognitive
architecture and system design into a self-reinforcing loop instead of treating
them separately. Based on this principle, we present Galaxy, a framework that
supports multidimensional interactions and personalized capability generation.
Two cooperative agents are implemented based on Galaxy: KoRa, a
cognition-enhanced generative agent that supports both responsive and proactive
skills; and Kernel, a meta-cognition-based meta-agent that enables Galaxy's
self-evolution and privacy preservation. Experimental results show that Galaxy
outperforms multiple state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablation studies and
real-world interaction cases validate the effectiveness of Galaxy.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have shown promise in automating mobile
tasks but still struggle with input redundancy and decision ambiguity. In this
paper, we present \textbf{RecAgent}, an uncertainty-aware agent that addresses
these issues through adaptive perception. We distinguish two types of
uncertainty in GUI navigation: (1) perceptual uncertainty, caused by input
redundancy and noise from comprehensive screen information, and (2) decision
uncertainty, arising from ambiguous tasks and complex reasoning. To reduce
perceptual uncertainty, RecAgent employs a component recommendation mechanism
that identifies and focuses on the most relevant UI elements. For decision
uncertainty, it uses an interactive module to request user feedback in
ambiguous situations, enabling intent-aware decisions. These components are
integrated into a unified framework that proactively reduces input complexity
and reacts to high-uncertainty cases via human-in-the-loop refinement.
Additionally, we propose a dataset called \textbf{ComplexAction} to evaluate
the success rate of GUI agents in executing specified single-step actions
within complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
our approach. The dataset and code will be available at
https://github.com/Fanye12/RecAgent.

Abstract: Computer use agent is an emerging area in artificial intelligence that aims

attention from both industry and academia. However, the present agents'
performance is far from being used. In this paper, we propose the
Self-Evolution Agent (SEA) for computer use, and to develop this agent, we
propose creative methods in data generation, reinforcement learning, and model
enhancement. Specifically, we first propose an automatic pipeline to generate
the verifiable trajectory for training. And then, we propose efficient
step-wise reinforcement learning to alleviate the significant computational
requirements for long-horizon training. In the end, we propose the enhancement
method to merge the grounding and planning ability into one model without any
extra training. Accordingly, based on our proposed innovation of data
generation, training strategy, and enhancement, we get the Selfevolution Agent
(SEA) for computer use with only 7B parameters, which outperforms models with
the same number of parameters and has comparable performance to larger ones. We
will make the models' weight and related codes open-source in the future.

satisfaction ratings, and a modest reduction in study duration compared to
standard content. Qualitative analysis highlights that learners found the
personalized material motivating and practical, enabling deep cognitive
engagement and strong identification with the content. These findings
underscore the value of aligning educational content with learners' career
goals and suggest that scalable AI personalization can bridge academic

to ensure computational accuracy. Evaluations on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KGA-ECoT significantly outperforms
existing prompting methods, achieving absolute accuracy improvements ranging
from several to over ten percentage points. Further analysis confirms the
critical roles of GraphRAG in enhancing code quality and external code
execution in ensuring precision. These findings collectively establish KGA-ECoT
as a robust and highly generalizable framework for complex mathematical

Abstract: Recent studies have extended the application of large language models (LLMs)
to geographic problems, revealing surprising geospatial competence even without
explicit spatial supervision. However, LLMs still face challenges in spatial
consistency, multi-hop reasoning, and geographic bias. To address these issues,
we propose GeoSR, a self-refining agentic reasoning framework that embeds core
geographic principles -- most notably Tobler's First Law of Geography -- into
an iterative prediction loop. In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed
into three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects
relevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that
chooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in
previous rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative
refinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further
rounds when necessary. This agentic loop progressively improves prediction
quality by leveraging both spatial dependencies and inter-variable
relationships. We validate GeoSR on tasks ranging from physical-world property
estimation to socioeconomic prediction. Experimental results show consistent
improvements over standard prompting strategies, demonstrating that
incorporating geostatistical priors and spatially structured reasoning into
LLMs leads to more accurate and equitable geospatial predictions. The code of
GeoSR is available at https://github.com/JinfanTang/GeoSR.

Abstract: Automated grading systems can efficiently score short-answer responses, yet
they often fail to indicate when a grading decision is uncertain or potentially
contentious. We introduce semantic entropy, a measure of variability across
multiple GPT-4-generated explanations for the same student response, as a proxy
for human grader disagreement. By clustering rationales via entailment-based
similarity and computing entropy over these clusters, we quantify the diversity
of justifications without relying on final output scores. We address three
research questions: (1) Does semantic entropy align with human grader
disagreement? (2) Does it generalize across academic subjects? (3) Is it
sensitive to structural task features such as source dependency? Experiments on
the ASAP-SAS dataset show that semantic entropy correlates with rater
disagreement, varies meaningfully across subjects, and increases in tasks
requiring interpretive reasoning. Our findings position semantic entropy as an
interpretable uncertainty signal that supports more transparent and trustworthy
AI-assisted grading workflows.

Abstract: Reactive synthesis from Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) can
be reduced to a two-player game over a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) of
the LTLf specification. The primary challenge here is DFA construction, which
is 2EXPTIME-complete in the worst case. Existing techniques either construct
the DFA compositionally before solving the game, leveraging automata
minimization to mitigate state-space explosion, or build the DFA incrementally
during game solving to avoid full DFA construction. However, neither is
dominant. In this paper, we introduce a compositional on-the-fly synthesis
framework that integrates the strengths of both approaches, focusing on large
conjunctions of smaller LTLf formulas common in practice. This framework
applies composition during game solving instead of automata (game arena)
construction. While composing all intermediate results may be necessary in the
worst case, pruning these results simplifies subsequent compositions and
enables early detection of unrealizability. Specifically, the framework allows
two composition variants: pruning before composition to take full advantage of
minimization or pruning during composition to guide on-the-fly synthesis.
Compared to state-of-the-art synthesis solvers, our framework is able to solve
a notable number of instances that other solvers cannot handle. A detailed
analysis shows that both composition variants have unique merits.

Abstract: Open-domain Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) faces significant challenges in
an ever-changing world, especially when considering the continual emergence of
new entities in daily news. Existing approaches for KGC mainly rely on
pretrained language models' parametric knowledge, pre-constructed queries, or
single-step retrieval, typically requiring substantial supervision and training
data. Even so, they often fail to capture comprehensive and up-to-date
information about unpopular and/or emerging entities. To this end, we introduce
Agentic Reasoning for Emerging Entities (AgREE), a novel agent-based framework
that combines iterative retrieval actions and multi-step reasoning to
dynamically construct rich knowledge graph triplets. Experiments show that,
despite requiring zero training efforts, AgREE significantly outperforms
existing methods in constructing knowledge graph triplets, especially for
emerging entities that were not seen during language models' training
processes, outperforming previous methods by up to 13.7%. Moreover, we propose
a new evaluation methodology that addresses a fundamental weakness of existing
setups and a new benchmark for KGC on emerging entities. Our work demonstrates
the effectiveness of combining agent-based reasoning with strategic information
retrieval for maintaining up-to-date knowledge graphs in dynamic information
environments.

Abstract: AI agents deployed in assistive roles often have to collaborate with other
agents (humans, AI systems) without prior coordination. Methods considered
state of the art for such ad hoc teamwork often pursue a data-driven approach
that needs a large labeled dataset of prior observations, lacks transparency,
and makes it difficult to rapidly revise existing knowledge in response to
changes. As the number of agents increases, the complexity of decision-making
makes it difficult to collaborate effectively. This paper advocates leveraging
the complementary strengths of knowledge-based and data-driven methods for
reasoning and learning for ad hoc teamwork. For any given goal, our
architecture enables each ad hoc agent to determine its actions through
non-monotonic logical reasoning with: (a) prior commonsense domain-specific
knowledge; (b) models learned and revised rapidly to predict the behavior of
other agents; and (c) anticipated abstract future goals based on generic
knowledge of similar situations in an existing foundation model. We
experimentally evaluate our architecture's capabilities in VirtualHome, a
realistic physics-based 3D simulation environment.

Abstract: Circuit Satisfiability (CSAT) plays a pivotal role in Electronic Design
Automation. The standard workflow for solving CSAT problems converts circuits
into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and employs generic SAT solvers powered by
Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL). However, this process inherently
discards rich structural and functional information, leading to suboptimal
solver performance. To address this limitation, we introduce CASCAD, a novel
circuit-aware SAT solving framework that directly leverages circuit-level
conditional probabilities computed via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By
explicitly modeling gate-level conditional probabilities, CASCAD dynamically
guides two critical CDCL heuristics -- variable phase selection and clause
managementto significantly enhance solver efficiency. Extensive evaluations on
challenging real-world Logical Equivalence Checking (LEC) benchmarks
demonstrate that CASCAD reduces solving times by up to 10x compared to
state-of-the-art CNF-based approaches, achieving an additional 23.5% runtime
reduction via our probability-guided clause filtering strategy. Our results
underscore the importance of preserving circuit-level structural insights
within SAT solvers, providing a robust foundation for future improvements in
SAT-solving efficiency and EDA tool design.

Abstract: BalancedBio is a theoretically grounded framework for parameter-efficient
biomedical reasoning, addressing multi-capability integration in
domain-specific AI alignment. It establishes the Biomedical Multi-Capability
Convergence Theorem, proving orthogonal gradient spaces are essential to
prevent capability interference for safe deployment. Key innovations include:
(1) Medical Knowledge Grounded Synthetic Generation (MKGSG), extending
Source2Synth with clinical workflow constraints and medical ontology validation
for factual accuracy and safety; and (2) Capability Aware Group Relative Policy
Optimization, deriving optimal hybrid reward weighting to maintain
orthogonality in RL, using a reward model with rule-based and model-based
scores adapted to biomedical tasks. Mathematical analysis proves Pareto-optimal
convergence, preserving performance across capabilities. It achieves
state-of-the-art results in its parameter class: domain expertise (80.95%
BIOMED-MMLU, +15.32% over baseline), reasoning (61.94%, +7.75%), instruction
following (67.95%, +6.44%), and integration (86.7%, +18.5%). Theoretical safety
guarantees include bounds on capability preservation and clinical accuracy.
Real-world deployment yields 78% cost reduction, 23% improved diagnostic
accuracy, and 89% clinician acceptance. This work provides a principled
methodology for biomedical AI alignment, enabling efficient reasoning with
essential safety and reliability, with the 0.5B model version to be released.

Abstract: Recent research has developed benchmarks for memory-augmented reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithms, providing Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP) environments where agents depend on past observations to make
decisions. While many benchmarks incorporate sufficiently complex real-world
problems, they lack controllability over the degree of challenges posed to
memory models. In contrast, synthetic environments enable fine-grained
manipulation of dynamics, making them critical for detailed and rigorous
evaluation of memory-augmented RL. Our study focuses on POMDP synthesis with
three key contributions:
  1. A theoretical framework for analyzing POMDPs, grounded in Memory Demand
Structure (MDS), transition invariance, and related concepts; 2. A methodology
leveraging linear process dynamics, state aggregation, and reward
redistribution to construct customized POMDPs with predefined properties; 3.
Empirically validated series of POMDP environments with increasing difficulty
levels, designed based on our theoretical insights. Our work clarifies the
challenges of memory-augmented RL in solving POMDPs, provides guidelines for
analyzing and designing POMDP environments, and offers empirical support for
selecting memory models in RL tasks.

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic
heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive
traps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative
Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from
probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking "Which
answer is most likely?", DRN asks "Which hypothesis has the most internally
consistent evidence?". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly
tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing
hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our
approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative
model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a
lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs.
Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to
expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over
standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with
Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most
challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional
training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable
reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2
reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: While generalist foundation models like Gemini and GPT-4o demonstrate
impressive multi-modal competence, existing evaluations fail to test their
intelligence in dynamic, interactive worlds. Static benchmarks lack agency,
while interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically
ignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm,
we introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate,
but to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the
full sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence,
OmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create
scenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine
cross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal
models reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on
high-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges
requiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this
fragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic
performance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive
"less is more" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically
improve performance. Our findings suggest that the path toward robust AGI
requires a research focus beyond scaling to explicitly address synergistic
fusion. Our platform is available for anonymous review at

Abstract: Whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can possess consciousness is a
contentious question because of the inherent challenges of defining and
operationalizing subjective experience. This paper proposes a framework to
reframe the question of artificial consciousness into empirically tractable
tests. We introduce three evaluative criteria - S (subjective-linguistic), L
(latent-emergent), and P (phenomenological-structural) - collectively termed
SLP-tests, which assess whether an AI system instantiates interface
representations that facilitate consciousness-like properties. Drawing on
category theory, we model interface representations as mappings between
relational substrates (RS) and observable behaviors, akin to specific types of
abstraction layers. The SLP-tests collectively operationalize subjective
experience not as an intrinsic property of physical systems but as a functional
interface to a relational entity.

Abstract: Graphical user interface visual grounding (GUI-VG), a core capability for GUI
agents, has primarily relied on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs), which demands extensive data curation and
significant training costs. However, as MLLMs continue to advance and even
cover GUI domains during pretraining, the necessity of exhaustive SFT
post-training becomes increasingly questionable. Meanwhile, recent successes of
rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) suggest a more efficient
alternative. Despite this promise, the optimal manner of applying RFT for
GUI-VG remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GuirlVG, a
reinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method built on a systematic empirical
study and a novel stabilization technique. We find that naive application of
RFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we
decompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of
each. Second, we propose a novel Adversarial KL Factor that dynamically
stabilizes training to mitigate reward over-optimization. Third, we further
explore the training configurations of RFT to enhance effectiveness. Extensive
experiments show that GuirlVG, with only 5.2K training samples, outperforms SFT
methods trained on over 10M samples, achieving a 7.7% improvement on
ScreenSpot, a 17.2% improvement on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% accuracy on
ScreenSpotV2.

Abstract: Frontier LLMs only recently enabled serviceable, autonomous web agents. At
that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest
interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application
state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation
$\unicode{x2013}$ referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are
premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual
cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing
relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code
interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML,
impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables
reliable implementation with web agents to date.
  We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a
GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web
dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a
grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) $\unicode{x2013}$ within the same input
token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations
$\unicode{x2013}$ one token order above, but within the model's context window
$\unicode{x2013}$ outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover,
yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.

Abstract: High-quality, multi-turn instructional dialogues between novices and experts
are essential for developing AI systems that support teaching, learning, and
decision-making. These dialogues often involve scaffolding -- the process by
which an expert supports a novice's thinking through questions, feedback, and
step-by-step guidance. However, such data are scarce due to privacy concerns in
recording and the vulnerability inherent in help-seeking. We present
SimInstruct, a scalable, expert-in-the-loop tool for collecting scaffolding
dialogues. Using teaching development coaching as an example domain,
SimInstruct simulates novice instructors via LLMs, varying their teaching
challenges and LLM's persona traits, while human experts provide multi-turn
feedback, reasoning, and instructional support. This design enables the
creation of realistic, pedagogically rich dialogues without requiring real
novice participants. Our results reveal that persona traits, such as
extroversion and introversion, meaningfully influence how experts engage.
Compared to real mentoring recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrate
comparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth. Experts also reported the
process as engaging and reflective, improving both data quality and their own
professional insight. We further fine-tuned a LLaMA model to be an expert model
using the augmented dataset, which outperformed GPT-4o in instructional
quality. Our analysis highlights GPT-4o's limitations in weak reflective
questioning, overuse of generic praise, a condescending tone, and a tendency to
overwhelm novices with excessive suggestions.

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated a latent capacity for complex
reasoning by spontaneously exhibiting cognitive behaviors such as step-by-step
reasoning, reflection, and backtracking, commonly referred to as "Aha Moments".
However, such emergent behaviors remain unregulated and uncontrolled, often
resulting in overthinking, where the model continues generating redundant
reasoning content even after reaching reliable conclusions. This leads to
excessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical
deployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory
mechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their
reasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To
address this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),
which explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and
control components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control
strategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction
mechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and
delegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling
the construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a
structured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised
fine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial
meta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment
Policy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control
behavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.
Experiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained
with MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional
J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution
of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to
reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and
mobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g.,
Graphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate
tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
of these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the
fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the
environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential
capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine
methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific
foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation
protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse
tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions
for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and
self-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents
research, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial
development. An open-source GitHub repository is maintained as a dynamic
resource to foster further innovation in this field. We present a 9-page
version of our work, accepted by ACL 2025, to provide a concise overview to the

Abstract: As the use of AI systems in society grows, addressing potential biases that
emerge from data or are learned by models is essential to prevent systematic
disadvantages against specific groups. Several notions of (un)fairness have
been proposed in the literature, alongside corresponding algorithmic methods
for detecting and mitigating unfairness, but, with very few exceptions, these
tend to ignore transparency. Instead, interpretability and explainability are
core requirements for algorithmic fairness, even more so than for other
algorithmic solutions, given the human-oriented nature of fairness. In this
paper, we contribute a novel interpretable, explainable method for bias
detection relying on debates about the presence of bias against individuals,
based on the values of protected features for the individuals and others in
their neighbourhoods. Our method builds upon techniques from formal and
computational argumentation, whereby debates result from arguing about biases
within and across neighbourhoods. We provide formal, quantitative, and
qualitative evaluations of our method, highlighting its strengths in
performance against baselines, as well as its interpretability and
explainability.

Abstract: Fostering students' abilities for knowledge integration and transfer in
complex problem-solving scenarios is a core objective of modern education, and
interdisciplinary STEM is a key pathway to achieve this, yet it requires expert
guidance that is difficult to scale. While LLMs offer potential in this regard,
their true capability for guided instruction remains unclear due to the lack of
an effective evaluation benchmark. To address this, we introduce SID, the first
benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the higher-order guidance
capabilities of LLMs in multi-turn, interdisciplinary Socratic dialogues. Our
contributions include a large-scale dataset of 10,000 dialogue turns across 48
complex STEM projects, a novel annotation schema for capturing deep pedagogical
features, and a new suite of evaluation metrics (e.g., X-SRG). Baseline
experiments confirm that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to execute
effective guided dialogues that lead students to achieve knowledge integration
and transfer. This highlights the critical value of our benchmark in driving
the development of more pedagogically-aware LLMs.

Abstract: Reasoning is a critical capability of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) for solving complex multimodal tasks, and judging the correctness of
reasoning steps is crucial for improving this capability. Recently, MLLM-based
process judges (MPJs) have been widely used to assess the correctness of
reasoning steps in multimodal tasks. Therefore, evaluating MPJs is important
for identifying their limitations and guiding future improvements. However,
existing benchmarks for MPJs mainly focus on tasks such as step correctness
classification and reasoning process search, while overlooking a key aspect:
whether the confidence scores produced by MPJs at the step level are reliable.
To address this gap, we propose ConfProBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
designed to systematically evaluate the reliability of step-level confidence
scores generated by MPJs. Our benchmark constructs three types of adversarially
perturbed reasoning steps: Synonym Substitution, Syntactic Transformation, and
Image Perturbation, to test the robustness of MPJ confidence under
perturbations. In addition, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics:
Confidence Robustness Score (CRS), Confidence Sensitivity Score (CSS), and
Confidence Calibration Score (CCS), which evaluate robustness, sensitivity, and
calibration, respectively. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including
both proprietary and open-source models. Experiments reveal limitations in
current MPJs' confidence performance and offer competitive baselines to support
future research.

Abstract: A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for
modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most
LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for
coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards,
which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration.
To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent,
multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO),
to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL
techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate
that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality
responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the
door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated
challenges.

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents
(CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled
data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software,
particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge,
we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to
autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software.
Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel
software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new
software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle
auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we
design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a
Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.
The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of
adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist
training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from
specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA
capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately
achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on
their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across
five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a
significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a
competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.
