Abstract: Sleep apnea, a prevalent sleep disorder, involves repeated episodes of
breathing interruptions during sleep, leading to various health complications,
including cognitive impairments, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke,
and even death. One of the main challenges in diagnosing and treating sleep
apnea is identifying individuals at risk. The current gold standard for
diagnosis, Polysomnography (PSG), is costly, labor intensive, and inconvenient,
often resulting in poor quality sleep data. This paper presents a novel
approach to the detection of sleep apnea using a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) trained on single channel EEG data. The proposed CNN achieved an accuracy
of 85.1% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.22, demonstrating a
significant potential for home based applications by addressing the limitations
of PSG in automated sleep apnea detection. Key contributions of this work also
include the development of a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline with an
Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Butterworth filter, a dataset construction
method providing broader temporal context, and the application of SMOTETomek to
address class imbalance. This research underscores the feasibility of
transitioning from traditional laboratory based diagnostics to more accessible,
automated home based solutions, improving patient outcomes and broadening the
accessibility of sleep disorder diagnostics.

Abstract: The paper presents an approach in which inertial signals measured with a
wrist-worn sensor (e.g., a smartwatch) are translated into those that would be
recorded using a shoe-mounted sensor, enabling the use of state-of-the-art gait
analysis methods. In the study, the signals are translated using Conditional
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Two different GAN versions are used for
experimental verification: traditional ones trained using binary cross-entropy
loss and Wasserstein GANs (WGANs). For the generator, two architectures, a
convolutional autoencoder, and a convolutional U-Net, are tested. The
experiment results have shown that the proposed approach allows for an accurate
translation, enabling the use of wrist sensor inertial signals for efficient,
every-day gait analysis.

### [3] [A Fluid Antenna Enabled Physical Layer Key Generation for Next-G Wireless Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00018)
*Jiacheng Guo,Ning Gao,Yiping Zuo,Hao Xu,Shi Jin,Kai Kit Wong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 液态天线（FA）可以提高物理层密钥生成（PLKG）系统的密钥生成率（KGR）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在恶劣的传播环境中，PLKG系统的KGR会受到不利影响。

Method: 提出了一种新的基于FA的PLKG系统，推导了FA阵列的KGR闭式表达式，并通过粒子群优化（PSO）算法和交替优化（AO）算法（结合了投影梯度下降（PGD）和PSO）对预编码矩阵和天线位置进行了联合优化。

Result: 与传统的固定位置天线（FPA）阵列和可重构智能表面（RIS）相比，FA系统具有优势。与均匀平面天线（UPA）相比，FA系统在PSO算法下KGR提高了35.42%，在AO算法下KGR提高了67.73%。

Conclusion: FA技术为PLKG系统在恶劣环境下的性能改进提供了新的途径。

Abstract: As a promising physical layer security technique, physical layer key
generation (PLKG) enables legitimate users to obtain secret keys from wireless
channel without security infrastructures. However, in harsh propagation
environments, the channel characteristic becomes unsatisfactory, the key
generation rate (KGR) is significantly deteriorated. In this paper, we propose
a novel fluid antenna (FA) enabled PLKG system to address this challenge.
Specifically, we first derive the closed-form expression of the KGR for FA
array, and then jointly optimize the precoding matrix and the antenna positions
via a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Next, to further reduce the
computational complexity of the optimization procedure, we develop an
alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which combines the projected gradient
descent (PGD) and the PSO. Simulation results demonstrate that by exploiting
the additional spatial degree of freedom (DoF), our FA enabled PLKG system is
superior to the benchmarks, such as the conventional fixed-position antenna
(FPA) array and the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). It is worth
highlighting that compared to the conventional uniform planar antenna (UPA),
the FA enabled PLKG achieves a 35.42\% KGR performance improvement under PSO
algorithm and a 67.73\% KGR performance improvement under AO algorithm,
respectively.

Abstract: Plantar pressure measurement, or pedobarography, is an essential tool for
analyzing human motion in healthy individuals and patients. Across the reviewed
literature, sensor insoles are motivated as wearable, mobile solutions for
assessing pressure distribution in applications including diabetic foot
monitoring, rehabilitation guidance, assistive device control, and sports
performance analysis. This review evaluates the current state of the art with
particular attention to sensor technologies, sensor quantity and placement,
participant cohorts, and reference standards. The focus lies on original works
with innovative designs, preferably supported by ambulation experiments. The
modalities covered include resistive, capacitive, inductive, piezoelectric,
triboelectric, and optical sensing approaches. We identify a lack of proper
sensor calibration, gait-based verification, and human study validation, and
propose a gold standard based on testing machines and instrumented treadmills
to ensure comparability across studies. The bidirectional interaction between
insole insertion and foot-sole mechanics is examined, with tissue stiffness
identified as a key source of uncertainty in sensor signals. Guidelines are
provided for sensor dimensions and unobtrusive insole designs to foster natural
gait. Finally, future directions include the development of multimodal sensors
to compensate for limitations of individual modalities and the emerging trend
of multiaxial sensing for capturing shear components in pressure distributions.

### [5] [CoMET: A Contrastive-Masked Brain Foundation Model for Universal EEG Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00314)
*Ang Li,Zikai Wang,Liuyin Yang,Zhenyu Wang,Tianheng Xu,Honglin Hu,Marc M. Van Hulle*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: CoMET是一个创新的脑基础模型，通过掩码自编码器和对比学习框架处理EEG数据，克服了现有模型过度关注局部特征的局限性，并在多项下游任务中取得了先进的成果，展示了其提取通用EEG表征的强大能力和临床潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的EEG深度模型通常局限于特定数据集和任务，限制了模型规模和泛化能力。现有的自监督模型虽然有所应用，但依赖于掩码重建策略，容易过度关注局部区域的信号相似性特征，而忽略了对下游任务至关重要的全局判别模式。

Method: 提出名为CoMET的脑基础模型，采用掩码自编码器作为骨干，并对EEG进行了专门的块划分和嵌入设计。同时，设计了一个新颖的对比学习框架，结合镜像尺度增强，以增强全局判别能力。

Result: CoMET在包含超过3000名受试者、一百万个样本的混合EEG数据集上进行了预训练，并在十个不同的下游数据集上进行了评估，取得了先进的成果，证明了其在提取通用EEG表征方面的优越能力和强大的临床潜力。

Conclusion: CoMET通过其独特的掩码自编码器和对比学习方法，有效解决了现有EEG模型在处理全局判别模式方面的不足，在广泛的下游任务中展现出卓越的性能和临床应用前景。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain
activity, widely used in brain-computer interfaces, clinic, and healthcare.
Traditional EEG deep models typically focus on specific dataset and task,
limiting model size and generalization. Recently, self-supervised brain
foundation models have emerged and been applied to various downstream tasks.
Nevertheless, these models still have limitations: current SOTA models
typically rely on masked reconstruction strategy; however, EEG features of
adjacent channels are highly correlated, which causes the pre-training to
overly focus on low-dimensional signal-similarity features in local regions and
neglect the global discriminative patterns vital for downstream tasks. To
address these limitations, we propose a brain foundation model called CoMET.
Specifically, we employ the masked autoencoder with redesigned patching and
embedding for EEG as backbone and devise a novel contrastive learning framework
with mirror-scale augmentation to strengthen the global discrimination ability.
CoMET is pre-trained on mixed EEG datasets over 3000 subjects with over one
million samples. It is evaluated on ten different downstream datasets, and the
SOTA results demonstrate CoMET's superior ability in extracting universal EEG
representations and strong clinical potential.

*R. Abhishek Shankar,Hyungjun Ha,Byunghoo Jung*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 基于6DoF磁跟踪的步态分析系统在人体活动识别任务中表现优于IMU+磁力计系统，准确率达92%，尤其在区分行走和负重行走方面有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴设备在便携性和可及性方面优于非可穿戴设备，但性能有待提高，需要开发新的可穿戴设备步态分析系统。

Method: 开发了一款基于6DoF磁跟踪的步态分析系统，并使用该系统收集了12名参与者的步态数据，用于人体活动识别任务，比较了CNN和LSTM两种深度学习分类器的性能，并将磁跟踪系统与IMU+磁力计系统进行了性能比较。

Result: 磁跟踪系统在步态分析任务中实现了92%的总体分类准确率，优于IMU+磁力计系统的86.69%。在区分行走（W）和负重行走（WW）方面，磁跟踪系统提高了约8%的准确率。

Conclusion: 基于6DoF磁跟踪的步态分析系统是可行的，它提供了比IMU+磁力计系统更丰富的信息，能够更好地进行步态分析和人体活动识别。

Abstract: Gait analysis using wearable devices has advantages over non-wearable devices
when it comes to portability and accessibility. However, non-wearable devices
have consistently shown superior performance in terms of the gait information
they can provide. This calls for the need to improve the performance of
wearable device based gait analysis. To that end, we developed a 6
Degrees-of-Freedom (6DoF) magnetic tracking based gait analysis system as a
step in this direction. The system is portable, minimally intrusive, wireless
and power efficient. As a proof-of-concept, the system was used for the task of
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to classify four tasks - walking (W), walking
with weight (WW), jogging (J) and marching on the spot (M). Gait data of 12
participants was collected. The classification performance of two deep learning
(DL) classifiers - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term
Memory (LSTM) - was compared. The performance of the magnetic tracking based
gait analysis system was also compared with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
+ magnetometer based system. The magnetic tracking based system showed an
overall classification accuracy of 92\% compared to 86.69\% for the IMU +
magnetometer system. Moreover, the magnetic tracking system showed an
improvement of about 8\% in being able to differentiate between W and WW. This
highlights the insufficiency in the information content in the data from IMU +
magnetometer, warranting the need for a complete 6DoF tracking. Our work, thus,
proves the feasibility of using magnetic tracking systems for the purpose of
gait analysis.

Conclusion: 该研究为在混合近场/远场环境中，利用超大规模天线阵列辅助的SWIPT系统设计安全混合波束成形提供了有效的解决方案，并对系统的安全性能进行了深入分析。

Abstract: This letter investigates secure hybrid beamforming (HB) design for an
extremely large-scale antenna array-aided simultaneous wireless information and
power transfer (SWIPT) system operating in a mixed near-field (NF)/far-field
(FF) environment. A base station (BS) employs HB to transmit information and
artificial noise (AN) signals simultaneously to multiple FF information
receivers (IRs) and NF energy receivers (ERs). The objective is to maximize the
weighted sum secrecy rate for the IRs, considering both Type-I (unable to
cancel AN) and Type-II (capable of canceling AN) IRs, subject to minimum energy
harvesting requirements at the ERs and a BS transmit power constraint. We
formulate optimization problems for both IR types and develop an efficient
iterative algorithm based on successive convex approximation. Simulation
results validate the proposed scheme and provide crucial insights into the
security performance of mixed-field SWIPT systems, highlighting the influence
of visibility regions and angular user separation.

Abstract: This paper tackles two key challenges in cell-freemassive multiple input
multiple output (CF-mMIMO) systems:efficient pilot allocation and practical
receiver design. To thisend, we introduce a novel pilot allocation framework
leveragingmanifold optimization to maximize the system sum rate, wherepilot
sequences are designed as nearly orthogonal sequences. Theproposed pilot design
enforces unimodularity constraints in thefrequency domain, ensuring pilots are
suitable for both communi-cation and sensing tasks. Additionally, a gaussian
belief propaga-tion (GaBP)-based receiver is introduced, providing
near-optimaldetection performance with substantially reduced
computationalcomplexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposedpilot
allocation method achieves communication performancecomparable to
state-of-the-art (SotA) algorithms, while deliveringsuperior sensing
capabilities due to its unimodular pilot design.The GaBP-based receiver
achieves robust performance andlower complexity compared to conventional
approaches. Thesecontributions advance the practical deployment of CF-mMIMOfor
integrated sensing and communications (ISAC).

*Liesbet Van der Perre,Gilles Callebaut,Thomas Eriksson,Muris Sarajlic,Christian Fager,Fredrik Tufvesson,Buon Kiong Lau,Erik G. Larsson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: sub-THz无线网络可以通过聚合低复杂度的无线单元（RUs）的射频信号，并利用聚合物微波光纤（PMFs）实现可靠覆盖，同时结合次10GHz系统提供控制信令和备用方案，以实现高性价比、高能效和实时连接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决sub-THz频段在高带宽、高精度定位和高级传感应用方面的巨大潜力，但同时也面临着部署可靠sub-THz网络的物理和技术挑战。

Method: 提出一种新的sub-THz覆盖范式，通过聚合物微波光纤（PMFs）将低复杂度无线单元（RUs）以菊花链方式互联，用户设备（UE）连接到附近的RUs以降低路径损耗和阻塞。RUs采用低复杂度、紧凑型集成天线模块。此外，提出双频串联操作，将sub-THz系统与提供控制信令和鲁棒备用解决方案的次10GHz系统集成。

Conclusion: 所提出的串联架构能够充分发挥sub-THz技术的潜力，为动态环境中实现成本效益高、能效高、高性能的实时连接铺平道路。

Abstract: The vast bandwidth available at sub-THz frequencies holds great promise for
high-speed wireless access, precise localization, and advanced sensing
applications. However, fundamental physical constraints and technological
limitations make the deployment of reliable sub-THz networks challenging. We
propose a new paradigm for sub-THz coverage by transmitting the RF signals over
polymer microwave fibers (PMFs) that interconnect low-complexity radio units
(RUs) in a daisy-chain configuration. The distributed architecture ensures that
user equipments (UEs) connect to RUs in their proximity, reducing path loss and
mitigating blocking. The RUs leverage low-complexity, compact integrated
antenna modules. Additionally, dual-frequency tandem operation is proposed,
integrating the sub-THz system with a sub-10 GHz system that provides control
signalling and a robust fallback solution for the sub-THz system. This proposed
tandem architecture can open up the full potential of sub-THz technology and
paves the way to cost- and energy-efficient, high-performance, real-time
connectivity in dynamic environments.

*Zahra Rostamikafaki,Francois Chan,Claude D'Amours*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于低地球轨道（LEO）卫星支持的无线信息与能量同时传输（SWIPT）系统的鲁棒资源分配框架，并辅以地面部署的同步传输反射智能超表面（STAR-RIS）。在卫星到地面链路受阻的情况下，卫星仅通过STAR-RIS服务于多个单天线能量接收器、信息接收器和窃听者。通过一个鲁棒优化问题来最大化总收集功率，同时满足保密率要求、发射功率限制和STAR-RIS系数约束，并考虑了实际的有界信道状态信息（CSI）误差模型。为了实现最优鲁棒资源分配，研究人员首先应用S过程处理信道不确定性带来的挑战，然后提出了一种交替优化（AO）框架，联合优化LEO卫星的主动波束成形和STAR-RIS的被动波束成形，并结合基于惩罚的策略来执行STAR-RIS波束成形设计。仿真结果验证了所提出算法的有效性，并表明STAR-RIS架构在总收集功率方面相比于传统RIS和其他基线方案取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: This paper proposes a robust resource allocation framework for a low Earth
orbit (LEO) satellite-enabled simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT) system, assisted by a ground-deployed simultaneously
transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS). We
consider a scenario where direct satellite-to-ground links are obstructed, and
the satellite serves multiple single-antenna energy receivers, information
receivers, and eavesdroppers exclusively via the STAR-RIS. A robust
optimization problem is formulated to maximize the total harvested power,
subject to secrecy rate requirements, transmit power limits, and STAR-RIS
coefficient constraints, under a practical bounded channel state information
(CSI) error model. To achieve optimal robust resource allocation, we address
the challenges posed by coupled optimization variables and bounded channel
estimation errors by first applying the S-procedure to handle robustness
against channel uncertainty. An alternating optimization (AO) framework is
subsequently proposed, where the active beamforming at the LEO satellite and
the passive beamforming at the STAR-RIS are jointly optimized, and a
penalty-based strategy is incorporated to enforce the STAR-RIS beamforming
design. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
and demonstrate that the STAR-RIS architecture achieves substantial performance
gains in total harvested power over conventional RIS and other baseline
schemes.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have
emerged as a transformative technology with applications spanning robotics,
virtual reality, medicine, and rehabilitation. However, existing BCI frameworks
face several limitations, including a lack of stage-wise flexibility essential
for experimental research, steep learning curves for researchers without
programming expertise, elevated costs due to reliance on proprietary software,
and a lack of all-inclusive features leading to the use of multiple external
tools affecting research outcomes. To address these challenges, we present
PyNoetic, a modular BCI framework designed to cater to the diverse needs of BCI
research. PyNoetic is one of the very few frameworks in Python that encompasses
the entire BCI design pipeline, from stimulus presentation and data acquisition
to channel selection, filtering, feature extraction, artifact removal, and
finally simulation and visualization. Notably, PyNoetic introduces an intuitive
and end-to-end GUI coupled with a unique pick-and-place configurable flowchart
for no-code BCI design, making it accessible to researchers with minimal
programming experience. For advanced users, it facilitates the seamless
integration of custom functionalities and novel algorithms with minimal coding,
ensuring adaptability at each design stage. PyNoetic also includes a rich array
of analytical tools such as machine learning models, brain-connectivity
indices, systematic testing functionalities via simulation, and evaluation
methods of novel paradigms. PyNoetic's strengths lie in its versatility for
both offline and real-time BCI development, which streamlines the design
process, allowing researchers to focus on more intricate aspects of BCI
development and thus accelerate their research endeavors. Project Website:

Abstract: To enhance the positioning and tracking performance of dynamic user equipment
(UE) in wideband millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems, we propose a novel
positioning error lower bound (PELB)-driven ping-pong positioning framework,
where the base station (BS) and UE alternately transmit and receive adaptive

the locally evaluated PELB. In this framework, we exploit multi-dimensional
information fusion to assist in positioning. Firstly, a multi-subcarrier
collaborative positioning error lower bound (MSCPEB) is proposed to evaluate
the positioning error limits of wideband mmWave systems, which quantifies the
contribution of all subcarriers to positioning accuracy. Moreover, we prove
that the MSCPEB does not exceed the arithmetic mean of the PELBs of the
individual subcarriers. Subsequently, we develop an alternating optimization
(AO) algorithm to optimize the hybrid beamformers targeted for MSCPEB
minimization. By convexifying this problem, closed-form solutions of
beamformers are derived. Finally, we develop a multipath collaborative
positioning method that quantifies the impact of path reliability on
positioning accuracy, with a closed-form solution for user position derived.
The proposed method does not rely on path resolution and traditional triangular
relationships. Numerical results validate that the proposed method improves
estimation accuracy by at least 16% compared to potential schemes without
optimized beam configurations, while requiring only approximately one-quarter
of the slot resources.

Abstract: Satellite missions demand ever greater connectivity, especially in the LEO
regime. In this paper, we introduce the new mega-constellation services in
space paradigm: we show that megaconstellations, deployed to offer innovative
services to Earth's users, can provide excellent connectivity to LEO spacecraft

Abstract: Near-field multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar imaging suffers from
high computational load inherently due to irregular spatial sampling with
distributed antennas. Existing acceleration methods for near-field MIMO imaging
typically rely on interpolation or compensation of measurements and are
primarily developed for direct reconstruction. This hinders their ease of
adoption for different MIMO geometries and requires further modification for
regularized inversion. In this study, we address these challenges by developing
a fast regularized reconstruction approach for three-dimensional near-field
MIMO imaging based on the Stochastic Proximal Gradient Method. We demonstrate
the performance of the developed approach through experimental measurements.
The results show a significant improvement in runtime without any notable

Abstract: Optimization-based solvers play a central role in a wide range of signal
processing and communication tasks. However, their applicability in
latency-sensitive systems is limited by the sequential nature of iterative
methods and the high computational cost per iteration. While deep unfolding has
emerged as a powerful paradigm for converting iterative algorithms into learned
models that operate with a fixed number of iterations, it does not inherently
address the cost of each iteration. In this paper, we introduce a learned
optimization framework that jointly tackles iteration count and per-iteration
complexity. Our approach is based on unfolding a fixed number of optimization
steps, replacing selected iterations with low-complexity approximated
computations, and learning extended hyperparameters from data to compensate for
the introduced approximations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on two representative problems: (i) hybrid beamforming; and (ii) robust
principal component analysis. These fundamental case studies show that our
learned approximated optimizers can achieve state-of-the-art performance while
reducing computational complexity by over three orders of magnitude. Our
results highlight the potential of our approach to enable rapid, interpretable,
and efficient decision-making in real-time systems.

Abstract: Data transmission from superconducting electronic circuits, such as single
flux quantum (SFQ) logic, to room-temperature electronics is susceptible to bit
errors, which may result from flux trapping, fabrication defects, and process
parameter variations (PPV). Due to the cooling power budget at 4.2 K and
constraints on the chip area, the size of the error-correction code encoders is
limited. In this work, three lightweight error-correction code encoders are
proposed that are based on Hamming(7,4), Hamming(8,4), and Reed-Muller(1,3)
codes and implemented with SFQ logic. The performance of these encoders is
analyzed in the presence of PPV. The trade-offs between the theoretical
complexity and physical size of error-correction code encoders are identified.

Abstract: We address the modeling and optimal beamforming (BF) design for
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) continuous aperture array (CAPA) systems
operating over doubly-dispersive (DD) channels. First, a comprehensive DD
continuous MIMO (DDC MIMO) channel model that incorporates CAPAs at both the
transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) is derived, which is used to obtain explicit
input-output (I/O) relations for various waveforms well suited to integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC) and robust to DD channels, namely orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS),
and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). Then, functional
optimization problems are formulated for the design of TX and RX BF matrices
that maximize received power, in which novel low-complexity, closed-form
solutions are obtained via the calculus of variations (CoV) method, yielding
expressions closely related to the classical matched filter commonly used in
conventional MIMO systems. Simulation results confirm that the proposed TX/RX
BF designs with CAPAs provide significant performance and computational
complexity gains over conventional MIMO systems in DD channels.

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) is a powerful tool in structural biology
for 3D visualization of cells and biological systems at resolutions sufficient
to identify individual proteins in situ. The measurements are collected by
tilting the frozen specimen and exposing it to an electron beam of known
dosage. As the biological samples are prone to electron damage, the samples can
be exposed to only a limited dosage of electrons, leading to noisy and
incomplete measurements. Thus, the reconstructions are noisy and incomplete,
leading to the missing wedge problem. Currently, self-supervised learning is
used to compensate for this issue. This typically involves, for each volume to
recover, training a large 3D UNet on the initial noisy reconstruction, leading
to large training time and memory requirements. In this work, we exploit the
local nature of the forward model to train a lightweight network using only
localized data from the measurements. This design provides flexibility in
balancing computational and time requirements while reconstructing the volumes
with high accuracy. We observe experimentally that this network can work well
on unseen datasets, despite using a network trained on a few measurements.

Abstract: Snapshot Multispectral Light-field Imaging (SMLI) is an emerging
computational imaging technique that captures high-dimensional data (x, y, z,
$\theta$, $\phi$, $\lambda$) in a single shot using a low-dimensional sensor.
The accuracy of high-dimensional data reconstruction depends on representing
the spectrum using neural radiance field models, which requires consideration
of broadband spectral decoupling during optimization. Currently, some SMLI
approaches avoid the challenge of model decoupling by either reducing
light-throughput or prolonging imaging time. In this work, we propose a
broadband spectral neural radiance field (BSNeRF) for SMLI systems. Experiments
show that our model successfully decouples a broadband multiplexed spectrum.
Consequently, this approach enhances multispectral light-field image
reconstruction and further advances plenoptic imaging.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate cascaded channel estimation for reconfigurable

systems. Since the complex channel gains of the cascaded RIS channel are
generally non-Gaussian, the use of the linear minimum mean squared error
(LMMSE) estimator leads to inevitable performance degradation. To tackle this
issue, we propose a variational inference-based framework that approximates the
complex channel gains using a complex adaptive Laplace prior, which effectively
captures their probability distributions in a tractable way. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms conventional estimators
including least squares and LMMSE in terms of cascaded channel estimation
error.

Abstract: Channel extrapolation has attracted wide attention due to its potential to
acquire channel state information (CSI) with high accuracy and minimal
overhead. This is becoming increasingly crucial as the sixth-generation (6G)
mobile networks aim to support complex scenarios, for example, high-mobility
communications utilizing ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
technologies and broad spectrum bands, necessitating multi-domain channel
extrapolation. Current research predominantly addresses channel extrapolation
within a single domain, lacking a comprehensive approach to multi-domain
channel extrapolation. To bridge the gap, we propose the concept of
multi-domain channel extrapolation, detailing the essential performance
requirements for 6G networks. These include precise channel extrapolation,
adaptability to varying scenarios, and manageable computational complexity
during both training and inference stages. In light of these requirements, we
elaborate the potential and challenges of incorporating generative artificial
intelligence (GAI)-based models for effective multi-domain channel
extrapolation. Given the ability of the Transformer to capture long-range
dependencies and hidden patterns, we propose a novel Transformer encoder-like
model by eliminating the positional encoding module and replacing the original
multi-head attention with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for multi-domain
channel extrapolation. Simulation results indicate that this model surpasses
existing baseline models in terms of extrapolation accuracy and inference
speed. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of the module
design of the proposed design. Finally, we pose several open questions for the
development of practical GAI-based multi-domain channel extrapolation models,
including the issues of explainability, generalization, and dataset collection.

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a tracer-based medical imaging modality
that enables quantification and spatial mapping of magnetic nanoparticle (MNP)
distribution. The magnetization response of MNPs depends on experimental
conditions such as drive field (DF) settings and medium viscosity, as well as
on magnetic parameters of MNPs such as magnetic core diameter, hydrodynamic
diameter, and magnetic anisotropy constant. A comprehensive understanding of
the magnetization response of MNPs can facilitate the optimization of DF and
MNP type for a given MPI application, without the need for extensive
experimentation. In this work, we propose a calibration-free iterative
algorithm using model-based dictionaries for MNP signal prediction at untested
settings. Dictionaries were constructed with the MNP signals simulated using
the coupled Brown-N\'eel rotation model. Based on the available measurements,
the proposed algorithm jointly estimates the dictionary weights and the
transfer functions due to non-model-based dynamics. These dynamics include the
system response of the measurement setup as well as magnetization dynamics not
accounted for by the employed coupled Brown-N\'eel rotation model. The
algorithm was first validated on synthetic signals at SNR levels of 1 and 10,
and then tested on an in-house MPS setup across six viscosity levels
(0.89-15.33 mPa.s) and DF frequencies of 0.25-2 kHz using two commercial MNPs.
Validation on synthetic signals showed accurate weight and transfer function
estimation even at SNR 1. MPS experiments demonstrated successful prediction of
MNP signals at untested viscosities, with NRMSE below 1.51% and 3.5% for the
two tested MNPs across all DF settings. Predicted signals captured viscosity
dependent trends, and NWD values remained low (<0.10 and <0.07 for the two
tested MNPs), confirming robust weight estimation.

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: Non-Gaussian noise, outliers, sudden load changes, and bad measurement data
are key factors that diminish the accuracy of dynamic state estimation in power
systems. Additionally, unscented Kalman filters (UKF) based on correntropy
criteria utilize bandwidth-sensitive Gaussian kernels, which may lead to
singular matrices in the Cholesky decomposition. To overcome all the above
problems, in this paper, a robust UKF based on Cauchy kernel maximum mixture
correntropy (CKMMC) criteria over hybrid Beluga Whale-Bat (BWB) optimization
(BWB-CKMMC-UKF) is proposed, in which the kernel is merged of two Cauchy
functions. Specifically, the measurement error and state error are unified in
the cost function by the statistical linearization technique, and the optimal
value of state estimation is obtained by fixed-point iteration. Because of its
insensitive feature to kernel bandwidth and notable thick-tailed feature, the
Cauchy kernel function is utilized instead of the Gaussian kernel in the
optimization criteria. Additionally, to fit the power system model, the shape
coefficients of the kernel in the CKMMC criterion and scale coefficients that
influence the selection of sigma points in the unscented transform are
determined based on the BWB algorithm. Simulation results on IEEE 14, 30, and
57-bus test systems validated the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Cryo-ET allows to generate tomograms of biological samples in situ, capturing

in reconstructed volumes, the large number of copies of the same macromolecules
makes it possible to retrieve high-resolution maps by averaging many aligned
subtomograms. To keep up with technical advances in the imaging process and the
resulting huge amounts of data available, there is a need for scalable, fast

enabling a speed-up of an order of magnitude compared to current approaches.

Competition as conducted, which provided a dataset from a three-sector outdoor

unevenly-spaced anchors, Our team developed three innovative positioning
frameworks that swept the top three awards of this competition, namely the
semi-supervised framework with consistency, ensemble learning-based algorithm
and decoupled mapping heads-based algorithm. Specifically, the semi-supervised
framework with consistency effectively generates high-quality pseudo-labels,
enlarging the labeled-dataset for model training. The ensemble learning-based
algorithm amalgamates the positioning coordinates from models trained under
different strategies, effectively combating the dynamic positioning
environments. The decoupled mapping heads-based algorithm utilized sector
rotation scheme to resolve the uneven-spaced anchor issue. Simulation results
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed positioning algorithms

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) perception refers to a suite of technologies that
empower vehicles to sense their environment and communicate with other
entities, including surrounding vehicles, infrastructure, and cloud/edge

three-dimensional (3D) geometric structure and orientation. This article
introduces the concept of RBL, highlights its unique advantages and
applications, identifies key technical challenges, and finally outlines future
research directions. In addition, the potential of RBL in next-generation -
e.g. beyond fifth generation (B5G) and sixth-generation (6G) - wireless systems
applied to V2X perception is also discussed, with a focus on its role in
standardization efforts and its relevance across automotive and industrial

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel ultrasonic array system designed for

correlation and increases robustness against multipath. The feasibility of the
approach is demonstrated through simulations of reflector imaging and analysis
of channel separation under realistic transducer bandwidth constraints. Results
show that MIMO processing enables improved separation of reflectors compared to
single-emitter configurations, although practical limitations such as
transducer bandwidth reduce the achievable channel isolation.

Abstract: This work studies an ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (uRLLC)
downlink system using pinching antennas which are realized by activating small
dielectric particles along a dielectric waveguide. Our goal is to maximize the
data rate by optimizing the positions of the pinching antennas. By proposing a
compact and cost-efficient antenna architecture and formulating a finite
blocklength-based optimization model, we derive a closed-form solution for the
optimal antenna placement under quality-of-service (QoS) and antenna spacing

design, enabling coherent signal superposition across the array. Simulation
results confirm significant rate improvements over conventional antenna systems
while satisfying uRLLC requirements, making the proposed design well-suited for

Abstract: We consider a novel rigid body localization (RBL) method, based only on a set
of measurements of the distances, as well as the angles between sensors of the
vehicle to the anchor landmark points. A key point of the proposed method is to
use a variation of the super multidimensional scaling (SMDS) algorithm, where
only a minor part of the complex edge kernel is used, based on the available
information, which in the case of RBL is anchor-to-anchor and target-to-target

TL;DR: 该论文研究了深度展开技术中损失函数选择对稀疏信号恢复算法的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决深度展开技术在稀疏信号恢复应用中损失函数选择的问题，本文对ISTA和IHT算法的深度展开版本进行了研究。

Method: 本文比较了使用均方误差的监督学习和使用原始优化问题目标函数的无监督学习。

Result: 研究结果表明，损失函数的选择对优化问题的凸性有显著影响。对于凸问题，监督学习精度更高但无法最小化目标函数；对于非凸问题，监督和无监督学习都能获得比原始算法更好的局部最小值，且性能相似。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计有效的深度展开网络提供了宝贵的见解。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of loss function selection in deep
unfolding techniques for sparse signal recovery algorithms. Deep unfolding
transforms iterative optimization algorithms into trainable lightweight neural
networks by unfolding their iterations as network layers, with various loss
functions employed for parameter learning depending on application contexts. We
focus on deep unfolded versions of the fundamental iterative shrinkage
thresholding algorithm (ISTA) and the iterative hard thresholding algorithm
(IHT), comparing supervised learning using mean squared error with unsupervised
learning using the objective function of the original optimization problem. Our
simulation results reveal that the effect of the choice of loss function
significantly depends on the convexity of the optimization problem. For convex
$\ell_1$-regularized problems, supervised-ISTA achieves better final recovery
accuracy but fails to minimize the original objective function, whereas we
empirically observe that unsupervised-ISTA converges to a nearly identical
solution as conventional ISTA but with accelerated convergence. Conversely, for
nonconvex $\ell_0$-regularized problems, both supervised-IHT and
unsupervised-IHT converge to better local minima than the original IHT, showing
similar performance regardless of the loss function employed. These findings
provide valuable insights into the design of effective deep unfolded networks
for sparse signal recovery applications.

the generalized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (gOMP) algorithm for improved noise
robustness in sparse signal processing. The JS-gOMP algorithm uniquely
incorporates the James-Stein estimator, optimizing the trade-off between signal

traditional gOMP, especially in noisy environments, offering a more effective
solution for signal and image processing applications where noise presence is
significant.

Abstract: The increasing number of satellite deployments, both in the low and
geostationary Earth orbit exacerbates the already ongoing scarcity of wireless
resources when targeting ubiquitous connectivity. For the aim of supporting a
massive number of IoT devices characterized by bursty traffic and modern
variants of random access, we pose the following question: Should competing
satellite operators share spectrum resources or is an exclusive allocation
preferable? This question is addressed by devising a communication model for
two operators which serve overlapping coverage areas with independent IoT
services. Analytical approximations, validated by Monte Carlo simulations,
reveal that spectrum sharing can yield significant throughput gains for both
operators under certain conditions tied to the relative serviced user
populations and coding rates in use. These gains are sensitive also to the
system parameters and may not always render the spectral coexistence mutually
advantageous. Our model captures basic trade-offs in uplink spectrum sharing
and provides novel actionable insights for the design and regulation of future
6G non-terrestrial networks.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion model, termed the non-identical diffusion model,
and investigate its application to wireless orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) channel generation. Unlike the standard diffusion model
that uses a scalar-valued time index to represent the global noise level, we
extend this notion to an element-wise time indicator to capture local error
variations more accurately. Non-identical diffusion enables us to characterize
the reliability of each element (e.g., subcarriers in OFDM) within the noisy
input, leading to improved generation results when the initialization is
biased. Specifically, we focus on the recovery of wireless multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) OFDM channel matrices, where the initial channel estimates
exhibit highly uneven reliability across elements due to the pilot scheme.
Conventional time embeddings, which assume uniform noise progression, fail to
capture such variability across pilot schemes and noise levels. We introduce a
matrix that matches the input size to control element-wise noise progression.
Following a similar diffusion procedure to existing methods, we show the
correctness and effectiveness of the proposed non-identical diffusion scheme
both theoretically and numerically. For MIMO-OFDM channel generation, we
propose a dimension-wise time embedding strategy. We also develop and evaluate
multiple training and generation methods and compare them through numerical
experiments.

Abstract: The emergence of dense, mission-driven aerial networks supporting the
low-altitude economy presents unique communication challenges, including
extreme channel dynamics and severe cross-tier interference. Traditional
reactive communication paradigms are ill-suited to these environments, as they
fail to leverage the network's inherent predictability. This paper introduces
predictive communication, a novel paradigm transforming network management from
reactive adaptation to proactive optimization. The approach is enabled by
fusing predictable mission trajectories with stable, large-scale radio
environment models (e.g., radio maps). Specifically, we present a hierarchical
framework that decomposes the predictive cross-layer resource allocation
problem into three layers: strategic (routing), tactical (timing), and
operational (power). This structure aligns decision-making timescales with the
accuracy levels and ranges of available predictive information. We demonstrate
that this foresight-driven framework achieves an order-of-magnitude reduction
in cross-tier interference, laying the groundwork for robust and scalable
low-altitude communication systems.

Abstract: Proximity-based interference is a growing threat to satellite communications,
driven by dense multi-orbit constellations and increasingly agile adversarial
maneuvers. We propose a hybrid simulation framework that integrates orbital
maneuver modeling with RF signal degradation analysis to detect and classify
suspicious proximity operations. Using the open-source Maneuver Detection Data
Generation (MaDDG) library from MIT Lincoln Laboratory, we generate labeled
datasets combining impulsive maneuver profiles with radio-frequency (RF)
impacts across a range of behavioral intents: routine station-keeping, covert
shadowing, and overt jamming. Our approach fuses kinematic features such as
range, velocity, acceleration, and Time of Closest Approach (TCA), with RF
metrics including Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), throughput, and
Jammer-to-Signal Ratio (JSR). These features are further enhanced with temporal
derivatives and rolling-window statistics to capture subtle or transient
interference patterns. A Random Forest classifier trained on this fused feature
set achieves 94.67% accuracy and a macro F1 score of 0.9471, outperforming
models using only kinematic or RF inputs. The system is particularly effective
in detecting covert threats, such as surveillance or intermittent jamming, that
evade RF-only methods.

Abstract: Accurate and timely water level monitoring is critical for flood prevention,
environmental management, and emerging smart infrastructure systems.
Traditional water sensing methods often rely on dedicated sensors, which can be
costly to deploy and difficult to maintain and are vulnerable to damage during
floods.In this work, we propose a novel cellular signalbased sensing scheme
that passively estimates water level changes using downlink mobile signals from
existing communication infrastructure. By capturing subtle variations in
channel state information (CSI), the proposed method estimates the length
changes of the water-reflected signal path, which correspond to water level
variations. A space-time processing framework is developed to jointly estimate
the angle of arrival and Doppler shift, enabling isolation and enhancement of
the water-reflected path via beamforming, while effectively suppressing
environmental noise. The phase evolution of the beamformed signal is then
extracted to infer water level changes. To address clock asynchronism between
the transmitter and receiver inherent in bistatic systems, we introduce a
beamforming-based compensation technique for removing time-varying random phase
offsets in CSI. Field experiments conducted across a river demonstrate that the
proposed method enables accurate and reliable water level estimation, achieving
a mean accuracy ranging from 1.5 cm to 3.05 cm across different receiver
configurations and deployments.

Abstract: Stress has emerged as a critical global health issue, contributing to
cardiovascular disorders, depression, and several other long-term illnesses.
Consequently, accurate and reliable stress monitoring systems are of growing
importance. In this work, we propose a stress prediction framework based on
electrocardiogram (ECG) signals recorded during multiple daily activities such

Abstract: This work investigates the covertness and security performance of
Internet-of-Things (IoTs) networks under Rayleigh fading environments.
Specifically, a cellular source transmits covert information to cell-edge users
with the assistance of an IoT master node, employing a coordinated direct and
relay transmission strategy combined with non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA). This approach not only enhances spectrum utilization but also generates
friendly interference to complicate a warden's surveillance or an
eavesdropper's decoding efforts. From a covertness perspective, we derive exact
closed-form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP) under
arbitrary judgment thresholds. We then identify the optimal judgment threshold
for the worst-case scenario, at which the warden minimizes its DEP performance.
Accordingly, we determine the effective region for user power allocation (PA)
in NOMA transmission that satisfies the DEP constraint. From a security
perspective, we derive analytical expressions for the secrecy outage
probability under two eavesdropping strategies using selection combining and
maximal ratio combining. Based on this analysis, we propose an adaptive PA
scheme that maximizes covert rate while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS)
requirements of legitimate users, the system's minimum covertness requirements,
and supporting successive interference cancellation (SIC) procedures.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive PA scheme that maximizes the secrecy rate
while ensuring the QoS requirements of legitimate users and SIC conditions.
Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of the analytical framework, while
the proposed optimization strategies effectively adjust PA coefficients to
maximize either the covert rate or the secrecy rate.

Abstract: As the vulnerabilities of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have
become more widely recognized, the need for complementary navigation systems
has grown. Medium frequency ranging mode (MF R-Mode) has gained attention as an
effective backup system during GNSS outages, owing to its strong signal
strength and cost-effective scalability. However, to achieve accurate
positioning, MF R-Mode requires correction for the additional secondary factor
(ASF), a propagation delay affected by terrain. The temporal variation of ASF,
known as temporal ASF, is typically corrected using reference stations;
however, the effectiveness of this method decreases with distance from the
reference station. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between temporal
ASF and meteorological factors to evaluate the feasibility of predicting
temporal ASF based on meteorological factors. Among these factors, temperature
and humidity showed significant correlations with temporal ASF, suggesting
their potential utility in ASF correction.

Abstract: The synergy between integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) unlocks novel applications and
advanced services for next-generation wireless networks, yet also introduces
new security challenges. In this study, a novel dual target-mounted
RISs-assisted ISAC scheme is proposed, where a base station with ISAC
capability performs sensing of two unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) targets, one
of which is legitimate and the other is eavesdropper, while communicating with
the users through an RIS mounted on the legitimate UAV target. The proposed
scheme addresses dual security threats posed by a hostile UAV target:
eavesdropping on legitimate user communications and random interference attacks
launched by a malicious RIS mounted on this eavesdropper UAV target, aiming to
disrupt secure transmissions. A non-convex optimization problem maximizing the
secrecy rate of the users is formulated, and a semi-definite relaxation
(SDR)-based two-stage solution is developed to optimize the transmit
beamforming matrix of the base station and the phase shift coefficients of the
legitimate RIS. Extensive computer simulations are conducted to evaluate the
robustness of the proposed solution under various system configurations. The
proposed system's communication performance is assessed using the secrecy rate
metric, while the sensing performance is evaluated through the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for
angle-of-departure (AoD) estimation of the eavesdropper UAV target.

Result: 与两个JSCC基线方案相比，SoM-MIMO在所有信噪比（SNR）水平下平均mAP（mean Average Precision）分别提高了6.30和10.48，同时保持了相同的通信开销。

Conclusion: SoM-MIMO通过结合SoM、特征金字塔和MIMO通信特性，有效提升了数字MIMO通信系统中网络化移动代理的协同感知任务性能。

Abstract: To support cooperative perception (CP) of networked mobile agents in dynamic
scenarios, the efficient and robust transmission of sensory data is a critical
challenge. Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has
demonstrated promising results for image transmission under adverse channel
conditions, outperforming traditional rule-based codecs. While recent works
have explored to combine JSCC with the widely adopted multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) technology, these approaches are still limited to the
discrete-time analog transmission (DTAT) model and simple tasks. Given the
limited performance of existing MIMO JSCC schemes in supporting complex CP
tasks for networked mobile agents with digital MIMO communication systems, this
paper presents a Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-based task-driven MIMO system
for image transmission, referred to as SoM-MIMO. By leveraging the structural
properties of the feature pyramid for perceptual tasks and the channel
properties of the closed-loop MIMO communication system, SoM-MIMO enables
efficient and robust digital MIMO transmission of images. Experimental results
have shown that compared with two JSCC baseline schemes, our approach achieves
average mAP improvements of 6.30 and 10.48 across all SNR levels, while
maintaining identical communication overhead.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) at terahertz (THz) frequencies
holds significant promise for unifying ultra-high-speed wireless connectivity
with fine-grained environmental awareness. Realistic and interpretable channel
modeling is essential to fully realize the potential of such systems. This work
presents a comprehensive investigation of monostatic sensing channels at
300~GHz, based on an extensive measurement campaign conducted at 57 co-located
transceiver (TRx) positions across three representative indoor scenarios.
Multipath component (MPC) parameters, including amplitude, delay, and angle,
are extracted using a high-resolution space-alternating generalized
expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. To cluster the extracted MPCs, an
image-processing-based clustering method, i.e., connected component labeling
(CCL), is applied to group MPCs based on delay-angle consistency. Based on the
measurement data, an environment-aware channel modeling framework is proposed
to establish mappings between physical scenario attributes (e.g., reflector
geometry, surface materials, and roughness) and their corresponding
channel-domain manifestations. The framework incorporates both specular and
diffuse reflections and leverages several channel parameters, e.g., reflection
loss, Lambertian scattering, and intra-cluster dispersion models, to
characterize reflection behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach can reliably extract physical characteristics, e.g.,
structural and material information, from the observed channel characteristics,
offering a promising foundation for advanced THz ISAC channel modeling.

TL;DR: ADDM是一种新的ISAC波形，它包括OTFS和AFDM，并能在高移动场景中提供与AFDM相当的BER性能，优于OTFS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ISAC波形OTFS和AFDM存在不兼容的问题，导致为OTFS设计的方法不能直接应用于AFDM。因此，需要一种能够统一这两种波形并克服其局限性的新波形。

Method: 提出了一种新的正交多载波波形——仿射多普勒时分复用（ADDM）。ADDM基于二维变换，在仿射-多普勒（A-D）域中调制信息符号，从而实现优于OTFS的无歧义多普勒和多普勒分辨率，并与AFDM相当。ADDM的符号块在A-D域中会经历由信道的延迟和多普勒引起的二维循环移位，这使得为OTFS和AFDM设计的现有方法可以应用于ADDM。

Result: 数值结果表明，ADDM在高移动场景下实现了与AFDM相当的比特错误率（BER）性能，并且优于OTFS。

Conclusion: ADDM是一种有前途的ISAC波形，它统一了OTFS和AFDM，并克服了它们在通信性能和方法兼容性方面的一些限制，特别是在高移动场景下。

Abstract: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) has been regarded as a
candidate integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) waveform owing to its
superior communication performance, outperforming the Orthogonal Time-Frequency
Space (OTFS) that has been researched for a longer time. However, since the
above two waveforms are incompatible with each other, the state-of-the-art
methods well-designed for OTFS may not be directly applicable to AFDM. This
paper introduces a new orthogonal multicarrier waveform, namely Affine-Doppler
Division Multiplexing (ADDM), which can provide a generic framework and subsume
the existing OTFS and AFDM as a particular case. ADDM modulating information
symbols in the Affine-Doppler (A-D) domain based on a two-dimensional (2D)
transform can enjoy both excellent unambiguous Doppler and Doppler resolution,
which is the same as AFDM but outperforms OTFS. Moreover, benefiting from the
2D transform, the symbols block of ADDM in the A-D domain undergoes a 2D cyclic
shift produced by the delay and the Doppler of the channel, similar to the 2D
cyclic shift in the delay-Doppler domain of cyclic prefix (CP)-OTFS. This
offers a potential to directly apply the state-of-the-art methods well-designed
for OTFS and AFDM to ADDM. Numerical results show that ADDM achieves comparable
BER performance with AFDM but outperforms OTFS in high-mobility scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces two novel algorithms designed to address the challenge
of super-resolution sensing parameter estimation in bistatic configurations
within communication-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
systems. Our approach leverages the estimated channel state information derived
from reference symbols originally intended for communication to achieve
super-resolution sensing parameter estimation. The first algorithm, IFFT-C2VNN,
employs complex-valued convolutional neural networks to estimate the parameters
of different targets, achieving significant reductions in computational
complexity compared to traditional methods. The second algorithm, PARAMING,
utilizes a parametric method that capitalizes on the knowledge of the system
model, including the transmit and receive array geometries, to extract the
sensing parameters accurately. Through a comprehensive performance analysis, we
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of both algorithms across a range
of signal-to-noise ratios, underscoring their applicability in realistic ISAC
scenarios.

Abstract: Next-generation networks require intelligent and robust channel conditions to
support ultra-high data rates, seamless connectivity, and large-scale device
deployments in dynamic environments. While flexible antenna technologies such
as fluid and movable antennas offer some degree of adaptability, their limited
reconfiguration range and structural rigidity reduce their effectiveness in
restoring line-of-sight (LoS) links. As a complementary solution, pinching
antenna systems (PASs) enable fine-grained, hardware-free control of radiation
locations along a waveguide, offering enhanced flexibility in challenging
propagation environments, especially under non-LoS (NLoS) conditions. This
paper introduces a general and novel modeling framework for downlink PASs
targeting users equipped with multiple receive antennas, addressing a practical
yet underexplored scenario in the existing literature. Specifically, we first
derive an analytical relationship between the received signal-to-noise ratio
and the pinching antenna (PA) positions, and based on this, we propose a
two-layer placement strategy. First, we optimize the central radiation point
using large-scale channel characteristics, and then we use a heuristic
compressed placement algorithm to approximate phase alignment across multiple
receive antennas and select a spatially compact set of active elements.
Simulation results demonstrate notable performance gains over conventional
single-antenna schemes, particularly in short-range scenarios with dense PAs
and widely spaced user antennas.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of co-channel interference and intentional
jamming in low-altitude air-ground communications. Since conventional
fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems lack spatial adaptability to dynamically
balance signal enhancement against interference suppression, we propose a
transformative fluid antenna system (FAS)-assisted heterogeneous dual-layer
transmission architecture. Specifically, a terrestrial base station with FPA
serves ground users, while a low altitude-serving base station equipped with
FAS communicates with the aerial user, also equipped with FAS, under the attack
of a malicious jammer. We formulate a worst-case achievable rate maximization
problem for aerial user subject to constraints including quality-of-service for
terrestrial users, imperfect jamming directions, minimum antenna separation,
etc. To address the non-convex problem, we propose a fractional
programming-block coordinate descent algorithm that alternately optimizes the
transmit precoders, receive combiner, and antenna positions at both transceiver
sides. Convex hull-based approach and geometric boundary method are used to
handle the jamming uncertainty and antenna placement constraints in confined
spatial regions, respectively. Extensive simulations validate significant
performance gains. The FAS achieves up to 56\% higher data rates than FPA under
equivalent power constraints. Strategic antenna repositioning demonstrably
enhances signal quality while suppressing interference, maintaining robustness
across diverse jammer channel uncertainties.

Abstract: The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technique has been considered
a key enabler for 6G radio access networks. ISAC fulfills a brand new paradigm
shift in wireless networks via the seamless interplay between communication and
sensing within a unified network. However, the tight integration of these
functionalities inevitably gives rise to various types of interference, posing
significant challenges to existing ISAC waveform designs and rendering
interference management a critical concern. Inspired by the development
trajectory of wireless communications, different multiple access (MA)
techniques, such as orthogonal multiple access (OMA), space-division multiple
access (SDMA), and more recently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and
rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), have been demonstrated to play a pivotal
role in efficiently utilizing limited spectrum resources, designing ISAC
waveforms, as well as managing inter-user interference and inter-functionality
interference in ISAC. Notably, the interplay between MA and ISAC presents
mutually beneficial integration. On the one hand, ISAC helps MA techniques
better exploit their interference management capability beyond the
communication-only networks. On the other hand, different MA techniques serve
as promising solutions for inter-functionality and inter-user interference
management in ISAC. In this paper, we deliver the first comprehensive tutorial
of MA techniques in ISAC networks. Specifically, we illustrate the fundamental
principles of ISAC, classify the diverse types of interference in different
ISAC systems, and compare MA-assisted ISAC designs, highlighting their
respective advantages and limitations. Moreover, we provide an outlook on the
emerging applications and future research directions of different MA-assisted
ISAC.

Abstract: In current vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication systems, roadside units
(RSUs) broadcast brief warning messages that alert nearby vehicles to avoid
potential hazards. However, these messages lack contextual information on why a
warning is issued, leading to excessive caution or inefficient driving
behaviors. To avoid such a situation, we propose a semantic-enhanced and
explainable V2X (SEE-V2X) system. In the proposed system, RSUs equipped with
smart cameras detect obstructions and transmit context-aware messages to
vehicles. By understanding both what the hazard is and why it occurs, drivers
can make more intelligent decisions based on their specific driving situation.
Furthermore, through a real-field demonstration, we show the new "see-through"
feature in the proposed system, which enables drivers to visualize hidden
pedestrians behind obstacles. We also perform simulations to compare
traditional V2X with SEE-V2X under different traffic conditions. The results
show that SEE-V2X significantly improves traffic efficiency and reduces
unnecessary deceleration.

Abstract: The space-air-ground-sea integrated networking (SAGSIN) concept promises
seamless global multimedia connectivity, yet two obstacles still limit its
practical deployment. Firstly, high-velocity satellites, aerial relays and
sea-surface platforms suffer from obsolete channel state information (CSI),
undermining feedback-based adaptation. Secondly, data-rate disparity across the
protocol stack is extreme: terabit optical links in space coexist with kilobit
acoustic under-water links. This article shows that a single large language
model (LLM) backbone, trained jointly on radio, optical and acoustic traces,
can provide a unified, data-driven adaptation layer that addresses both rapid
CSI ageing and severe bandwidth disparity across the SAGSIN protocol stack.
Explicitly, an LLM-based long-range channel predictor forecasts the strongest
delay-Doppler components several coherence intervals ahead, facilitating
near-capacity reception despite violent channel fluctuations. Furthermore, our
LLM-based semantic encoder turns raw sensor payloads into task-oriented tokens.
This substantially reduces the SNR required for high-fidelity image delivery in
a coastal underwater link, circumventing the data rate limitation by semantic
communications. Inclusion of these tools creates a medium-agnostic adaptation
layer that spans radio, optical and acoustic channels. We conclude with
promising open research directions in on-device model compression, multimodal
fidelity control, cross-layer resource orchestration and trustworthy operation,
charting a path from laboratory prototypes to field deployment.
