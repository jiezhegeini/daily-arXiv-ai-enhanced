Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a\nnon-invasive window into brain activity, but conventional methods struggle to\ncapture its transient complexity. We present the \\textbf{EEG Microstate\nAnalysis Framework (EEG-MSAF)}, an end-to-end pipeline that leverages EEG\nmicrostates discrete, quasi-stable topographies to identify DEM-related\nbiomarkers and distinguish DEM, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal\ncognition (NC). EEG-MSAF comprises three stages: (1) automated microstate\nfeature extraction, (2) classification with machine learning (ML), and (3)\nfeature ranking using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to highlight key\nbiomarkers. We evaluate on two EEG datasets: the public Chung-Ang University\nEEG (CAUEEG) dataset and a clinical cohort from Thessaloniki Hospital. Our\nframework demonstrates strong performance and generalizability. On CAUEEG,\nEEG-MSAF-SVM achieves \\textbf{89\\% $\\pm$ 0.01 accuracy}, surpassing the deep\nlearning baseline CEEDNET by \\textbf{19.3\\%}. On the Thessaloniki dataset, it\nreaches \\textbf{95\\% $\\pm$ 0.01 accuracy}, comparable to EEGConvNeXt. SHAP\nanalysis identifies mean correlation and occurrence as the most informative\nmetrics: disruption of microstate C (salience/attention network) dominates DEM\nprediction, while microstate F, a novel default-mode pattern, emerges as a key\nearly biomarker for both MCI and DEM. By combining accuracy, generalizability,\nand interpretability, EEG-MSAF advances EEG-based dementia diagnosis and sheds\nlight on brain dynamics across the cognitive spectrum."}

This makes\noptimal resource allocation across power, subcarriers, and decoding orders\ncrucial for interference channels (ICs), where neither transmitters nor\nreceivers can cooperate. Current orthogonal multiple access (OMA) methods, as\nwell as non-orthogonal (NOMA) and rate-splitting (RSMA) schemes, rely on fixed\nheuristics for interference management, leading to suboptimal rates, power\ninefficiency, and scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel minPIC\nframework for optimal power, subcarrier, and decoding order allocation in\ngeneral multi-user ICs. Unlike existing methods, minPIC eliminates heuristic\nSIC order assumptions. Despite the convexity of the IC capacity region, fixing\nan SIC order induces non-convexity in resource allocation, traditionally\nrequiring heuristic approximations. We instead introduce a dual-variable-guided\nsorting criterion to identify globally optimal SIC orders, followed by convex\noptimization with auxiliary log-det constraints, efficiently solved via binary\nsearch. We also demonstrate that minPIC could potentially meet the stringent\nhigh-rate, low-power targets of immersive XR and other 6G applications. To the\nbest of our knowledge, minPIC is the first algorithmic realisation of the\nPareto boundary of the SIC-achievable rate region for Gaussian ICs, opening the\ndoor to scalable interference management in cell-free networks."}

Since the legacy wireless systems\nwere designed based on often decades-old assumptions about wireless\ninterference, utilizing these new bands will result in interference with the\nexisting legacy users. Many of these legacy wireless devices are used by\ncritical infrastructure networks upon which society depends. There is an urgent\nneed to develop schemes that can protect legacy users from such interference.\nFor many applications, legacy users are located within\ngeographically-constrained regions. Several studies have proposed mitigating\ninterference through the implementation of exclusion zones near these\ngeographically-constrained regions. In contrast to solutions based on\ngeographic exclusion zones, this paper presents a communication theory-based\nsolution. By leveraging knowledge of these geographically-constrained regions,\nwe aim to reduce the interference impact on legacy users. We achieve this by\nincorporating received power constraints, termed as region constraints, in our\nmassive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system design. We perform a\ncapacity analysis of single-user massive MIMO and a sum-rate analysis of the\nmulti-user massive MIMO system with transmit power and region constraints.

Our elasticity estimation approach is based on imaging complex and\ndiffuse wave fields that encompass multiple wave frequencies and propagate in\nvarious directions.
