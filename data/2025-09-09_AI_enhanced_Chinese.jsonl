Compared to the conventional cell sectoring wireless communication\nsystem, the proposed omnicell system is expected to not only significantly\nreduce the inter-user interference, but also improve the cost efficiency.\nExtensive analytical and numerical results are provided to compare those key\nperformance indicators such as the spatial resolution and the communication\nrate of the proposed full-angle RAA based omnicell wireless communication\nsystem against the conventional ULA/UCA-based cell sectoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5168\u89d2\u5ea6\u5c04\u7ebf\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\uff08RAA\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7531\u5176\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5168\u5411\u5c0f\u533a\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u62df/\u6570\u5b57\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\uff08ULA/UCA\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cRAA\u67b6\u6784\u5177\u6709\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3001\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u589e\u76ca\u9ad8\u3001\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u5411\u89d2\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5747\u5300\u7b49\u4f18\u70b9\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u89d2\u5ea6RAA\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u5168\u5411\u5c0f\u533a\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u89d2\u5ea6RAA\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5c06RAA\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u89d2\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5168\u89d2\u5ea6\u57df\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5168\u5411\u5c0f\u533a\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u57fa\u7ad9\u914d\u5907\u5168\u89d2\u5ea6RAA\u5e76\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u5c0f\u533a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5c06\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5168\u89d2\u5ea6RAA\u5168\u5411\u5c0f\u533a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eULA/UCA\u7684\u6247\u533a\u5206\u533a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u901f\u7387\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5168\u89d2\u5ea6RAA\u5168\u5411\u5c0f\u533a\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u671b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7528\u6237\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Different imaging channels respond non-uniformly to EMI\nowing to their distinct coupling characteristics. Here, we investigate\nchannel-specific interference pathways in a permanent-magnet-based low-field\nMRI system and show that saddle coils are intrinsically more vulnerable to\ntransverse EMI components than solenoidal coils.

This advantage is realized by leveraging powerful\nneural networks to learn an optimal end-to-end mapping from the source data\ndirectly to the transmit symbol sequence, eliminating the need for separate\nsource coding, channel coding, and modulation. Although numerous efforts have\nbeen made towards efficient DeepJSCC, they have largely stayed at numerical\nsimulations that can be far from practice, leaving the real-world viability of\nDeepJSCC largely unverified. To this end, we prototype DeepStream upon\northogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology to offer efficient\nand robust DeepJSCC for multimedia transmission. In conforming to OFDM, we\ndevelop both a feature-to-symbol mapping method and a cross-subcarrier\nprecoding method to improve the subcarrier independence and reduce\npeak-to-average power ratio. To reduce system complexity and enable flexibility\nin accommodating varying quality of service requirements, we further propose a\nprogressive coding strategy that adjusts the compression ratio based on latency\nwith minimal performance loss. We implement DeepStream for real-time image\ntransmission and video streaming using software-defined radio.

Numerical results are presented and demonstrate that: i) the\nEKF approach can accurately track the warden's CSI with low complexity, ii) the\neffectiveness of the proposed solution is verified by its outperformance over\nthe greedy and searching-based benchmarks, and iii) with new design degrees of\nfreedom (DoFs), the performance of PASS is superior to the conventional\nfully-digital MIMO systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5939\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08PASS\uff09\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u8f85\u52a9\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u6784\u5929\u7ebf\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u9690\u853d\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff08EKF\uff09\u8ddf\u8e2a\u654c\u65b9\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8054\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u566a\u58f0\uff08AN\uff09\u548c\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u5b89\u5168\u65e5\u76ca\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u62b5\u6297\u7a83\u542c\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u5f0f\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u901a\u4fe1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u9690\u853d\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u654c\u65b9\u76d1\u542c\u8005\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPASS\uff08Sensing-aided covert communication network empowered by pinching antenna systems\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u8be5\u7f51\u7edc\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u5939\u5929\u7ebf\uff08PA\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u9690\u853d\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u83b7\u53d6\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u654c\u65b9\uff08warden\uff09\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff08CSI\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4f20\u611f\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff08EKF\uff09\u6765\u8ddf\u8e2a\u654c\u65b9\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u566a\u58f0\uff08AN\uff09\u548cPA\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u548cAN\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6cd5\uff0c\u800cPA\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5219\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u654c\u65b9\u79fb\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "1.

Traditional methods\nsuch as stand-on scales, length-based tapes, or transfer-based weighing scales\nare often impractical for immobilized patients, inaccurate, or labor-intensive\nand time-consuming. This paper introduces MelodyBedScale, a non-intrusive and\nrapid on-bed weight estimation system that leverages bed vibration induced by\nmusic. The core insight is that body weight affects the vibration transfer\nfunction of the bed-body system, which is captured using vibration sensors\nplaced on opposite sides of the bed. First, we identify weight-sensitive\nfrequency bands and compose clinically acceptable soft, natural music with high\nsignal energy in these frequency bands. This music is then played through a\nspeaker mounted on the bed to induce bed vibrations. Additionally, to\nefficiently capture the complex weight-vibration relationship with limited data\nand enhance generalizability to unseen individuals and weights, we\ntheoretically analyze the weight-vibration relationship and integrate the\nresults into the activation functions of the neural network for\nphysics-informed weight regression.

Current joint\ndetection tracking methods, which focus on dynamically adjusting detection\nthresholds from tracking results, still present challenges in fully utilizing\nthe potential of radar signals. These are mainly reflected in the limited\ncapacity of the constant false-alarm rate model to accurately represent\ninformation, the insufficient depiction of complex scenes, and the limited\ninformation acquired by the tracker. We introduce the Integrated Detection and\nTracking based on radar feature (InDT) method, which comprises a network\narchitecture for radar signal detection and a tracker that leverages detection\nassistance. The InDT detector extracts feature information from each\nRange-Doppler (RD) matrix and then returns the target position through the\nfeature enhancement module and the detection head. The InDT tracker adaptively\nupdates the measurement noise covariance of the Kalman filter based on\ndetection confidence. The similarity of target RD features is measured by\ncosine distance, which enhances the data association process by combining\nlocation and feature information. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method\nwas validated through testing on both simulated data and publicly available\ndatasets."}

This paper explores the\napplicability and effectiveness of Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) for\nmassive MIMO signal processing to tackle the reliability challenge of Near\nThreshold Computing (NTC). We propose modifying matrix arithmetic Newton\niteration MIMO algorithm to seamlessly integrate ABFT to detect any\ncomputational errors by inspecting the final result. The overhead from ABFT\ndepends largely on the matrix dimensions, which in this context are dictated by\nthe number of user equipments involved in the computation.

However, NTC is highly susceptible\nto variations in Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) which can lead to\nincreased error rates in computations. Traditional techniques for enabling NTC,\nsuch as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling guided by circuit level timing\nerror detection methods, introduce considerable hardware complexity and are\ndifficult to implement at high clock frequencies. In this context ABFT has\nemerged as a lightweight error detection method tailored for matrix operations\nwithout requiring any modifications on circuit-level and can be implemented\npurely in software.A MIMO accelerator was implemented on a reconfigurable\nhardware platform.

Unlike deep learning (DL)\napproaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach\nalso avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more\nlightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with\nsupervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully\nCSI-free manner.
