*Boyang Chen,Mohd Tasleem Khan,George Goussetis,Mathini Sellathurai,Yuan Ding,João F. C. Mota*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: COMET框架利用硬件偏移二元编码（OBC）技术优化CNN设计，以在低功耗边缘设备上实现高性能和资源利用率的协同优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低功耗边缘设备上部署计算密集型CNN面临硬件依赖和资源限制的挑战。

Method: 提出COMET框架，采用OBC技术对输入（方案A）和权重（方案B）进行CNN推理的协同优化，利用位宽不对称性。通过修改移位累加操作并结合偏移项和预缩放偏置，提出四种新颖的查找表（LUT）技术（并行、共享、分离、混合），并开发基于OBC的通用矩阵乘法核，使用im2col变换加速定点修改版LeNet-5模型。

Result: FPGA评估结果显示，所提出的协同优化方法与最先进的基于LeNet-5的CNN设计相比，显著减少了资源利用率，同时对精度的影响极小。

Conclusion: COMET框架通过OBC技术实现了CNN在低功耗边缘设备上的高效部署，为资源受限环境下的AI应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are highly effective for computer vision
and pattern recognition tasks; however, their computational intensity and
reliance on hardware such as FPGAs pose challenges for deployment on low-power
edge devices. In this work, we present COMET, a framework of CNN designs that
employ efficient hardware offset-binary coding (OBC) techniques to enable
co-optimization of performance and resource utilization. The approach
formulates CNN inference with OBC representations of inputs (Scheme A) and
weights (Scheme B) separately, enabling exploitation of bit-width asymmetry.
The shift-accumulate operation is modified by incorporating the offset term
with the pre-scaled bias. Leveraging inherent symmetries in Schemes A and B, we
introduce four novel look-up table (LUT) techniques -- parallel, shared, split,
and hybrid -- and analyze them to identify the most efficient options. Building
on this foundation, we develop an OBC-based general matrix multiplication core
using the im2col transformation, enabling efficient acceleration of a
fixed-point modified LeNet-5 model. FPGA evaluations demonstrate that the
proposed co-optimization approach significantly reduces resource utilization
compared to state-of-the-art LeNet-5 based CNN designs, with minimal impact on
accuracy.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文将可变块相关模型（VBCM）应用于流体天线系统（FAS）的安全分析，解决了传统模型分析困难和过于简化的缺点。通过推导平均保密容量（ASC）和保密中断概率（SOP）的封闭表达式，证明了VBCM的准确性。此外，还设计了网格搜索（GS）和梯度下降（GD）算法来优化ASC，取得了显著的性能提升，尤其在高威胁和紧凑型天线配置下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型在分析流体天线系统（FAS）的空间相关性时存在分析困难（如Jakes模型）或过于简化（如恒定相关模型）的问题，无法准确捕捉真实行为，因此需要新的模型和方法来解决这些挑战。

Method: 本文应用了Ramírez-Espinosa等人提出的可变块相关模型（VBCM）来分析FAS的安全性，并推导了平均保密容量（ASC）和保密中断概率（SOP）的封闭表达式。此外，还设计了网格搜索（GS）和梯度下降（GD）两种算法来优化ASC。

Result: VBCM框架实现了与仿真结果一致的分析精度，相对误差低于5%，优于恒定相关模型的10%-15%。优化算法在AMC方面取得了显著的性能提升，在高威胁场景下提升超过120%，在紧凑型天线配置下提升18%-19%。

Conclusion: 可变块相关模型（VBCM）为FAS安全分析提供了高精度的解决方案，并且通过优化算法可以显著提升ASC。将VBCM集成到FAS安全分析和优化中具有实际价值，是推进6G通信系统的有力工具。

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) are emerging as a transformative enabler for
sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications, providing unprecedented spatial
diversity through dynamic reconfiguration of antenna ports. However, the
inherent spatial correlation among ports poses significant challenges for
accurate analysis. Conventional models such as Jakes are analytically
intractable, while oversimplified constant-correlation models fail to capture
the true behavior. In this work, we address these challenges by applying the
variable block-correlation model (VBCM) -- originally proposed by
Ram\'{i}rez-Espinosa \textit{et al.} in 2024 -- to FAS security analysis, and
by developing comprehensive optimization methods to enhance analytical
accuracy. We derive new closed-form expressions for average secrecy capacity
(ASC) and secrecy outage probability (SOP), demonstrating that the VBCM
framework achieves simulation-aligned accuracy, with relative errors
consistently below $5\%$ (compared to $10$--$15\%$ for constant-correlation
models). To maximize ASC, we further design two algorithms: a grid search (GS)
method and a gradient descent (GD) method. Numerical results reveal that the
VBCM-based approach not only provides reliable insights into FAS security
performance, but also yields substantial gains -- ASC improvements exceeding
$120\%$ in high-threat scenarios and $18$--$19\%$ performance enhancements for
compact antenna configurations. These findings underscore the practical value
of integrating VBCM into FAS security analysis and optimization, establishing
it as a powerful tool for advancing 6G communication systems.

### [3] [On-Grid Equivalence of Continuous-Time Doubly Selective Channels: A Revisit of Bello's Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03626)
*Jun Tong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了实际物理信道（具有离网延迟和多普勒频移）的在网格双选（DD）域建模，并考虑了收发器上的实际时/频域加窗。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际物理信道通常是离网的，而通信研究通常使用在网格的DD信道模型，这之间存在差距。本研究旨在弥合这一差距，并重新审视实际物理信道的在网格建模。

Method: 研究了具有离网延迟和多普勒频移的连续时间、双选信道的等效在网格DD域表示，并考虑了收发器上的实际时/频域加窗。模型适用于具有有限支撑的加窗函数。

Result: 得到了适用于有限支撑加窗的通用模型，并将Bello的经典结果扩展到更一般的加窗情况。论文还讨论了等效在网格模型的特征和影响。

Conclusion: 该研究通过考虑实际的离网信道特性和收发器加窗，改进了对双选信道的在网格建模，为通信系统设计提供了更准确的理论基础。

Abstract: Significant studies on communications over doubly selective channels have
utilized on-grid DD channel models, which are previously investigated in
Bello's seminar paper in 1963. The DD grid is typically specified by the
bandwidth and time duration of the transmission frames. However, the physical
channels are determined by the propagation environments and they are typically
off-grid. Hence, there is often a gap between an actual physical channel and
the on-grid model. This paper revisits the on-grid modeling of practical
physical channels. We study the associated on-grid DD-domain representations
for continuous-time, doubly selective channels with off-grid delay and Doppler
shifts, accounting for practical time/frequency-domain windowing at the
transceivers. The universal models obtained are applicable under the mild
assumption that the windows have finite supports, and they extend Bello's
classical results to account for more general windows. We also discuss the
features and implications of the equivalent on-grid models.

### [4] [Pinching Antenna Systems (PASS) for Cell-Free Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03628)
*Haochen Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合了天线缩放技术（PASS）的无蜂窝通信系统，并进行了和速率最大化问题的优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究提出了一个结合了天线缩放技术（PASS）的无蜂窝通信系统，旨在解决提高系统吞吐量的问题。

Method: 使用交替优化（AO）算法来解决非凸优化问题。其中，数字波束成形子问题采用加权最小均方误差（WMMSE）方法，而天线缩放波束成形子问题则通过基于惩罚的方法结合逐元优化来解决。

Result: 仿真结果表明：1）PASS辅助无蜂窝系统性能优于基准方案；2）增加每个波导管的数量可以增强PASS辅助无蜂窝系统的优势；3）无蜂窝架构可以减轻用户数量增加导致的平均用户速率下降。

Conclusion: PASS辅助无蜂窝系统在通信性能上具有优势，并且该系统能够有效缓解用户数量增加对网络性能的影响。

Abstract: A pinching antenna system (PASS) assisted cell-free communication system is
proposed. A sum rate maximization problem under the BS power budget constraint
and PA deployment constraint is formulated. To tackle the proposed non-convex
optimization problem, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed.
In particular, the digital beamforming sub-problem is solved using the weighted
minimum mean square error (WMMSE) method, whereas the pinching beamforming
sub-problem is handled via a penalty based approach combined with element-wise
optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) the PASS assisted
cell-free systems achieve superior performance over benchmark schemes; 2)
increasing the number of PAs per waveguides can improve the advantage of PASS
assisted cell-free systems; and 3) the cell-free architecture mitigates the
average user rate degradation as the number of users increases.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: ISAC系统中，通过联合传输保密通信信号和专用传感信号，以最大化总和速率，同时满足窃听者SINR和传感SCNR约束，并提出了一种基于分数规划的交替优化算法，该算法利用SCA和SDR处理非凸约束，并扩展到混合模拟-数字阵列架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究了多用户多窃听器ISAC系统中，基于传感辅助的安全通信问题。

Method: 提出了一种分数规划的交替优化算法，并利用SCA和SDR处理非凸约束，最后将其扩展到混合模拟-数字阵列架构。

Result: 仿真结果表明，少量传感波束足以实现传感和干扰窃听者，所提出的设计优于基线方法，并揭示了通信-传感权衡。

Conclusion: ISAC系统可以通过联合传输通信和传感信号来实现高效的安全通信，并且可以通过优化的波束设计来平衡通信和传感性能。

Abstract: In this paper, sensing-assisted secure communication in a multi-user
multi-eavesdropper integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is
investigated. Confidential communication signals and dedicated sensing signals
are jointly transmitted by a base station (BS) to simultaneously serve users
and sense aerial eavesdroppers (AEs). A sum rate maximization problem is
formulated under AEs' Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) and
sensing Signal-to-Clutter-plus-Noise Ratio (SCNR) constraints. A
fractional-programming-based alternating optimization algorithm is developed to
solve this problem for fully digital arrays, where successive convex
approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) are leveraged to handle
non-convex constraints. Furthermore, the minimum number of dedicated sensing
beams is analyzed via a worst-case rank bound, upon which the proposed
beamforming design is further extended to the hybrid analog-digital (HAD) array
architecture, where the unit-modulus constraint is addressed by manifold
optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that only a small number of
sensing beams are sufficient for both sensing and jamming AEs, and the proposed
designs consistently outperform strong baselines while also revealing the
communication-sensing trade-off.

*Yiqiao Chen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本研究首次对儿科心血管疾病（CVD）的深度学习多标签分类进行了基准测试，使用了ZZU-pECG数据集，评估了ResNet-1D、BiLSTM、Transformer和Mamba 2等模型在9导和12导心电图上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童心血管疾病（CVD）是一个重要的健康问题，早期筛查至关重要，而心电图（ECG）是一种非侵入性且易于获取的工具，非常适合此目的。

Method: 在ZZU-pECG数据集（包含3716条记录和19种CVD类别）上，系统评估了四种深度学习模型（ResNet-1D、BiLSTM、Transformer和Mamba 2）在9导和12导心电图配置下的性能。

Result: 所有模型均取得了优异的成绩，部分设置下的汉明损失低至0.0069，F1分数超过85%。ResNet-1D在12导心电图子集上达到了94.67%的宏观F1分数，BiLSTM和Transformer也表现出竞争力。类别的分析表明，在9导心电图子集上，肥厚型心肌病等罕见病面临挑战，这反映了阳性样本有限的影响。

Conclusion: 这项基准研究建立了可重复使用的基线模型，并强调了不同模型范式之间的优势互补性。同时，研究指出了未来需要更大规模、多中心验证、按年龄分层分析以及更广泛的疾病覆盖范围，以支持儿科心电图应用的实际部署。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major pediatric health burden, and early
screening is of critical importance. Electrocardiography (ECG), as a
noninvasive and accessible tool, is well suited for this purpose. This paper
presents the first benchmark study of deep learning for multi-label pediatric
CVD classification on the recently released ZZU-pECG dataset, comprising 3716
recordings with 19 CVD categories. We systematically evaluate four
representative paradigms--ResNet-1D, BiLSTM, Transformer, and Mamba 2--under
both 9-lead and 12-lead configurations. All models achieved strong results,
with Hamming Loss as low as 0.0069 and F1-scores above 85% in most settings.
ResNet-1D reached a macro-F1 of 94.67% on the 12-lead subset, while BiLSTM and
Transformer also showed competitive performance. Per-class analysis indicated
challenges for rare conditions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the
9-lead subset, reflecting the effect of limited positive samples. This
benchmark establishes reusable baselines and highlights complementary strengths
across paradigms. It further points to the need for larger-scale, multi-center
validation, age-stratified analysis, and broader disease coverage to support
real-world pediatric ECG applications.

Conclusion: 本研究是实现FR3频段全功能多频带ISAC的初步探索，为未来6G无线通信和传感技术的发展指明了方向。

Abstract: Frequency Range 3 (FR3) in the 7-24 GHz band will be the new spectrum for 6G
wireless networks. The bandwidth availability and diversity of FR3 offer
unprecedented opportunities for coherent multiband Integrated Sensing and
Communications (ISAC), which aggregates the carrier phase information from
multiple frequency bands to increase the sensing resolution to the cm-level.
However, the frequency anisotropy of sensing targets over GHz-wide bands and
the non-contiguity of the 6G spectrum, pose critical challenges to the
application of existing multiband ISAC techniques. We present the first study
on coherent multiband sensing in FR3. We experimentally characterize the
frequency anisotropy of targets and propose new phase coherence metrics for
multiband processing. Then, we analyze the impact of non-contiguous FR3 bands
considered by 3GPP, and design a new algorithm to mitigate the resulting
sensing artifacts, outperforming existing techniques. Our results represent a
first step toward fully developing multiband ISAC for FR3.

### [8] [Source PAC Coding for Low-latency Secret Key Generation in Short Blocklength Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03818)
*Lulu Song,Di Zhang,Tingting Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 源极性编码是一种用于6G物联网的关键技术，但现有方案在短码长下的性能下降。本文提出了一种多层极性编码调整卷积（PAC）编码框架和一种新的码构造算法，以提高短码长下的密钥生成速率和协调可靠性。

Method: 提出了一种多层源PAC编码框架，并设计了一种结合极化效应和最大似然（ML）解码错误系数的码构造算法。

Result: 所提出的多层源PAC方案在短码长下，相较于传统和多层源极性编码方法，在密钥不同意约束下实现了更高的密钥生成速率。

Conclusion: 所提出的多层源PAC编码框架和码构造算法能够有效提升短码长下的密钥生成性能，为6G物联网提供更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Source polar coding is a potential solution for short blocklength-based
low-latency key generation with limited sources, which is a critical aspect of
six generation (6G) Internet of things. However, existing source coding schemes
still suffer from significant degradation in key generation rate and
reconciliation reliability in short blocklength regime. To address this issue,
we introduce a multilevel source polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC)
coding framework. Furthermore, we propose a novel code construction algorithm
that jointly leverages polarization effects and the maximum likelihood (ML)
decoding error coefficient. Simulations demonstrate that the multilevel source
PAC scheme with the proposed code construction achieves superior key generation
rate under key disagreement constraints compared to conventional and multilevel
source polar coding methods even in short blocklength regimes.

### [9] [Multi-Frequency Resonating Based Magnetic Induction Underground Emergency Communications with Diverse Mediums](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03848)
*Jianyu Wang,Zhichao Li,Wenchi Cheng,Wei Zhang,Hailin Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 多样介质衰落下的磁感应通信


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的磁感应（MI）通信技术在土壤、混凝土和金属等介质中具有优势，但实际应用中，这些介质由于灾难的影响会随机组合，对通信造成挑战。

Method: 提出一种统计衰落信道模型（对数正态分布），并使用多频谐振补偿（MuReC）线圈实现多频带传输，以减轻衰落影响。对复用和分集两种情况下的信噪比（SNR）概率密度函数、遍历容量、平均比特错误率（BER）和中断概率进行了分析。

Result: 数值结果表明，MuReC多频带传输方案能有效降低多样介质衰落的影响，提升通信性能。

Conclusion: MuReC技术可以有效克服地下应急通信中多样化介质带来的挑战，提高通信的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Magnetic induction (MI) communication is an effective underground emergency
communication technique after disasters such as landslides, mine collapses, and
earthquakes, due to its advantages in mediums such as soil, concrete, and
metals. However, the propagation mediums in practical MI based underground
emergency communications are usually diverse and composed randomly due to the
impact of disasters, which poses a challenge for MI communication in practical
applications. In this paper, we formulate a statistical fading channel model,
which reflects the random composition of diverse mediums and is shown to follow
a lognormal distribution. To mitigate the impact of diverse medium fading,
Multi-frequency Resonating Compensation (MuReC) based coils are used to achieve
multiband transmission. Then, we analyze the performance of MuReC based
multi-band MI communication with diverse medium fading and derive the
expressions of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) probability density functions,
ergodic capacities, average bit error rates (BERs), and outage probabilities
for both multiplexing and diversity cases. Numerical results show that MuReC
based multiband transmission schemes can effectively reduce the impact of
diverse medium fading and enhance the performance.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的{\alpha}-{\mu}随机变量和的PDF和CDF的解析表达式是迄今为止最有效和易于管理的，解决了现有方法的局限性，并为分析相关的通信系统性能提供了新的工具。

Abstract: The sum of random variables (RVs) appears extensively in wireless
communications, at large, both conventional and advanced, and has been subject
of longstanding research. The statistical characterization of the referred sum
is crucial to determine the performance of such communications systems.
Although efforts have been undertaken to unveil these sum statistics, e.g.,
probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF),
no general efficient nor manageable solutions capable of evaluating the exact
sum PDF and CDF are available to date. The only formulations are given in terms
of either the multi-fold Brennan's integral or the multivariate Fox H-function.
Unfortunately, these methods are only feasible up to a certain number of RVs,
meaning that when the number of RVs in the sum increases, the computation of
the sum PDF and CDF is subject to stability problems, convergence issues, or
inaccurate results. In this paper, we derive new, simple, exact formulations
for the PDF and CDF of the sum of L independent and identically distributed
{\alpha}-{\mu} RVs. Unlike the available solutions, the computational
complexity of our analytical expressions is independent of the number of
summands. Capitalizing on our unprecedented findings, we analyze, in exact and
asymptotic manners, the performance of L-branch pre-detection equal-gain
combining and maximal-ratio combining receivers over {\alpha}-{\mu} fading
environments. The coding and diversity gains of the system for both receivers
are analyzed and quantified. Moreover, numerical simulations show that the
computation time reduces drastically when using our expressions, which are
arguably the most efficient and manageable formulations derived so far.

### [11] [Robust Beamforming for Magnetic Induction Based Underground Emergency Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03852)
*Jianyu Wang,Tianrui Hou,Wenchi Cheng,Hailin Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Despite channel estimation errors in underground magnetic induction communication, a robust beamforming scheme can improve reliability and throughput by minimizing power consumption under sum rate and SINR constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Magnetic induction (MI) communication is vital for underground emergency communications, and magnetic beamforming enhances its performance using channel state information (CSI). However, channel estimation errors due to complex interferences in post-disaster underground environments pose a challenge.

Method: The paper formulates a beamforming optimization problem to minimize power consumption under sum rate and signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) constraints, considering channel estimation errors. It uses a worst-case optimization criterion and the S-procedure to convert the non-convex problem into a convex one for solving.

Result: Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed robust beamforming scheme effectively improves communication reliability and throughput even when channel estimation errors are present.

Conclusion: The developed robust beamforming scheme is effective in mitigating the negative impacts of channel estimation errors, thereby enhancing the performance of multi-user MI underground emergency communications.

Abstract: Magnetic induction (MI) communication is an effective underground emergency
communication technique after disasters such as landslides, mine collapses, and
earthquakes, due to its advantages in mediums such as soil, concrete, and
metals. Based on channel state information (CSI), magnetic beamforming can
significantly improve the performance of MI communication. However, in
post-disaster underground communication, channel estimation may suffer from
errors due to factors such as complex environmental interferences. Taking
channel estimation error into account, we formulate a beamforming optimization
problem for multi-user MI underground emergency communications, which aims to
minimize the power consumption under the constraints of sum rate and signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of each user. Based on the worst-case
optimization criterion and the S-procedure, the non-convex optimization problem
is transformed into convex and solved. Numerical results show that the proposed
robust beamforming scheme can effectively enhance communication reliability and
effective throughput in the presence of channel estimation errors.

*Vincent Savaux,Steve Sawadogo,Hyeon Seok Rou,Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: AFDM和OTFS调制方案在抗非白化高斯噪声方面，AFDM性能优于OTFS和OFDM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AFDM和OTFS调制方案在非白化高斯噪声下的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过分析解调矩阵使噪声白化的能力，并将此能力与矩阵稀疏性相关联，来评估AFDM和OTFS的性能。

Result: AFDM的解调矩阵通常比其他波形（如OTFS和OFDM）稀疏度低，因此在非白化高斯噪声下性能更优，增益超过1 dB。

Conclusion: AFDM在非白化高斯噪声下的性能优于OTFS和OFDM，这得益于其解调矩阵的特性。研究结果支持AFDM在窄带信号或与OFDM信号共存等应用场景中的使用。

Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of affine frequency division
multiplexing (AFDM) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation
schemes against non-white Gaussian noise, which can model various sources of
additive disturbances to the received signal. The proposed approach
demonstrates that the performance of these waveforms depends on the ability of
the demodulation matrix to whiten the noise-a property that is, in turn,
related to the sparsity of the matrix. AFDM is shown to outperform OTFS and
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), as its demodulation matrix
is generally less sparse than those of the other waveforms. Based on this
analysis, several application examples and use cases are presented, such as the
use of AFDM and OTFS in narrowband signals or in coexistence with OFDM signals.
Finally, simulation results confirm that AFDM achieves better performance than
OTFS and OFDM in the presence of non-white noise, with gains exceeding 1 dB in
most application scenarios.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够利用测距测量有效地估计运动目标的位姿、速度和加速度。

Abstract: This letter presents a novel method for estimating the position, velocity,
and acceleration of a moving target using range-based measurements. Although
most existing studies focus on position and velocity estimation, the framework
of this letter is extended to include acceleration. To achieve this, we propose
using the derivative of the range rate, in addition to the range and range rate
measurements. The proposed method estimates the position at first using
Time-of-Arrival (TOA)-based techniques; then, develops a reformulated least
squares (LS) and weighted least squares (WLS) approaches for velocity
estimation; and finally, employs the derivative of the range rate to estimate
the acceleration using previous position and velocity estimates. On the other
hand, closed-form LS and WLS solutions are derived for both velocity and
acceleration. The simulation results show that the proposed approach provides
improved performance in estimating moving target kinematics compared to
existing methods.

Motivation: 该研究旨在提出一种计算效率高、传感器数量最少（N+1个）的两阶段估计算法，用于融合TDOA和FDOA测量，以定位N维空间中的运动源。

Method: 该方法采用两阶段估计：第一阶段引入辅助参数，通过加权最小二乘法求解伪线性方程组，然后利用Sylvester结果式将问题简化为四元方程，得到无害变量的闭式估计。第二阶段进行线性精炼以减小残差偏差。

Result: 在温和的高斯噪声假设下，该估计算法的定位和速度估计在统计上是有效的，接近CRLB。仿真结果表明，该方法在2D和3D场景下达到了CRLB级别的精度，并且在定位精度和性能上优于现有的两阶段和迭代基线方法。

Conclusion: CLEAR算法能够以理论上最小的传感器数量实现CRLB级别的精度，并且在计算效率和性能上优于现有方法，非常适合用于无人机跟踪和智能交通等功耗受限的物联网应用。

Abstract: This paper presents CLEAR -- a closed-form localization estimator with a
reduced sensor network. The proposed method is a computationally efficient,
two-stage estimator that fuses time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) and
frequency-difference-of-arrival (FDOA) measurements with a minimal number of
sensors. CLEAR localizes a moving source in N-dimensional space using only N+1
sensors, achieving the theoretical minimum sensor count. The first stage
introduces auxiliary range and range-rate parameters to construct a set of
pseudo-linear equations, solved via weighted least squares. An algebraic
elimination using Sylvester's resultant then reduces the problem to a quartic
equation, yielding closed-form estimates for the nuisance variables. A second,
lightweight linear refinement stage is applied to mitigate residual bias. Under
mild Gaussian noise assumptions, the estimator's position and velocity
estimates are statistically efficient, closely approaching the Cramer-Rao lower
bound (CRLB). Extensive Monte Carlo simulations in 2-D and 3-D scenarios
demonstrate CRLB-level accuracy and consistent performance gains over
representative two-stage and iterative baselines, confirming the method's high
suitability for power-constrained, distributed Internet of Things (IoT)
applications such as UAV tracking and smart transportation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of integrating multistatic coherent
imaging functionalities in the downlink (DL) of a phase-coherent distributed
multiple input multiple output (D-MIMO) communication network. During DL, the
D-MIMO access points (APs) jointly precode the transmitted signals to maximize
the spectral efficiency (SE) at the users (UEs) locations. However, imaging
requires that \textit{(i)} a fraction of the APs work as receivers for sensing
and \textit{(ii)} the transmitting APs emit AP-specific and orthogonal signals
to illuminate the area to be imaged and allow multistatic operation. In these
settings, our contribution is twofold. We propose a novel distributed
integrated sensing and communication (D-ISAC) system that superposes a
purposely designed AP-specific signal for imaging to the legacy UE-specific
communication one, with a tunable trade-off factor. We detail both the imaging
waveform design according to the \textit{extended orthogonality condition} and
the space-frequency precoder design. Then, we propose an optimized selection
strategy for the receiving APs, in order to maximize imaging performance under
half-duplex constraints. Extensive numerical results prove the feasibility and
benefits of our proposal, materializing the potential of joint multistatic
imaging and communications in practical D-MIMO deployments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个考虑视距（LOS）和非视距（NLOS）成分、频率衰减、反射和宽带频谱平均的太赫兹（THz）通信信道模型，在208 GHz下进行了实验验证，结果显示该模型比传统方法更准确，尤其是在增加带宽时。

Motivation: 现有模型难以处理室内太赫兹通信中的频率选择性和多径效应，因此需要更精确的信道模型。

Method: 提出一个物理模型，联合考虑确定性LOS和随机NLOS成分，并加入频率依赖衰减（通过优化的指数alpha和beta）、两射线反射框架（处理驻波现象）和宽带频谱平均（减少频率选择性）。

Result: 在208 GHz载波和0.1-0.9 m范围内，模型实现了低至2.54 dB的均方根误差（RMSE），比自由空间路径损耗（FSPL）效果好14.2%，并且随着带宽增加，RMSE降低了73.3%。

Conclusion: 带宽对于抑制振荡伪影和提高建模精度至关重要。所提出的模型为室内无线个人区域网络（WPANs）、设备到设备（D2D）通信和未来6G应用中的精确本地化提供了可靠的基础。

Abstract: Accurate channel modeling is essential for realizing the potential of
terahertz (THz) communications in 6G indoor networks, where existing models
struggle with severe frequency selectivity and multipath effects. We propose a
physically grounded Rician fading channel model that jointly incorporates
deterministic line-of-sight (LOS) and stochastic non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
components, enhanced by frequency-dependent attenuation characterized by
optimized exponents alpha and beta. Unlike conventional approaches, our model
integrates a two-ray reflection framework to capture standing wave phenomena
and employs wideband spectral averaging to mitigate frequency selectivity over
bandwidths up to 15 GHz. Empirical measurements at a 208 GHz carrier, spanning
0.1-0.9 m, demonstrate that our model achieves root mean square errors (RMSE)
as low as 2.54 dB, outperforming free-space path loss (FSPL) by up to 14.2% and
reducing RMSE by 73.3% as bandwidth increases. These findings underscore the
importance of bandwidth in suppressing oscillatory artifacts and improving
modeling accuracy. Our approach provides a robust foundation for THz system
design, supporting reliable indoor wireless personal area networks (WPANs),
device-to-device (D2D) communications, and precise localization in future 6G
applications.

Abstract: In 6G wireless networks, multi-modal ML models can be leveraged to enable
situation-aware network decisions in dynamic environments. However, trained ML
models often fail to generalize under domain shifts when training and test data
distributions are different because they often focus on modality-specific
spurious features. In practical wireless systems, domain shifts occur
frequently due to dynamic channel statistics, moving obstacles, or hardware
configuration. Thus, there is a need for learning frameworks that can achieve
robust generalization under scarce multi-modal data in wireless networks. In
this paper, a novel and data-efficient two-phase learning framework is proposed
to improve generalization performance in unseen and unfamiliar wireless
environments with minimal amount of multi-modal data. In the first stage, a
physics-based loss function is employed to enable each BS to learn the physics
underlying its wireless environment captured by multi-modal data. The
data-efficiency of the physics-based loss function is analytically
investigated. In the second stage, collaborative domain adaptation is proposed
to leverage the wireless environment knowledge of multiple BSs to guide
under-performing BSs under domain shift. Specifically, domain-similarity-aware
model aggregation is proposed to utilize the knowledge of BSs that experienced
similar domains. To validate the proposed framework, a new dataset generation
framework is developed by integrating CARLA and MATLAB-based mmWave channel
modeling to predict mmWave RSS. Simulation results show that the proposed
physics-based training requires only 13% of data samples to achieve the same
performance as a state-of-the-art baseline that does not use physics-based
training. Moreover, the proposed collaborative domain adaptation needs only 25%
of data samples and 20% of FLOPs to achieve the convergence compared to
baselines.

Abstract: Memristor crossbars enable vector-matrix multiplication (VMM), and are
promising for low-power applications. However, it can be difficult to write the
memristor conductance values exactly. To improve the accuracy of VMM, we
propose a scheme based on low-rank matrix approximation. Specifically, singular
value decomposition (SVD) is first applied to obtain a low-rank approximation
of the target matrix, which is then factored into a pair of smaller matrices.
Subsequently, a two-step serial VMM is executed, where the stochastic write
errors are mitigated through step-wise averaging. To evaluate the performance
of the proposed scheme, we derive a general expression for the resulting
computation error and provide an asymptotic analysis under a prescribed
singular-value profile, which reveals how the error scales with matrix size and
rank. Both analytical and numerical results confirm the superiority of the
proposed scheme compared with the benchmark scheme.

Abstract: In recent decades Human Body Communication has emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional radio wave communication, utilizing the body's
conductive properties for low-power connectivity among wearables. This method
harnesses the human body as an energy-efficient channel for data transmission
within the electro-quasistatic frequency range, enabling advancements in
human-machine interaction. While prior work has noted the role of parasitic
return paths in such capacitively coupled systems, the influence of surrounding
metallic objects on these paths, which are critical for EQS wireless signaling,
has not been fully explored. This paper fills that gap with a structured study
of how various conducting objects, from non-grounded (floating) metals and
grounded metals to enclosed metallic environments such as elevators and cars,
affect the body-communication channel. We present a theoretical framework
supported by finite element method simulations and experiments with wearable
devices. Results show that metallic objects within 20 cm of devices can reduce
transmission loss by about 10 dB. When a device ground connects to a grounded
metallic object, channel gain can increase by at least 20 dB. Contact area
during touch-based interactions with grounded metals produces contact-impedance
dependent high-pass channel characteristics. Proximity to metallic objects
introduces variability within a critical distance, with grounded metals
producing a larger overall effect than floating metals. These findings improve
understanding of body-centric communication links and inform design for
healthcare, consumer electronics, defense, and industrial applications.

Abstract: The commencement of the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks represents a
fundamental shift in the integration of communication and sensing technologies
to support next-generation applications. Integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) is a key concept in this evolution, enabling end-to-end support for both
communication and sensing within a unified framework. It enhances spectrum
efficiency, reduces latency, and supports diverse use cases, including smart
cities, autonomous systems, and perceptive environments. This tutorial provides
a comprehensive overview of ISAC's role in 6G networks, beginning with its
evolution since 5G and the technical drivers behind its adoption. Core
principles and system variations of ISAC are introduced, followed by an
in-depth discussion of the enabling technologies that facilitate its practical
deployment. The paper further analyzes current research directions to highlight
key challenges, open issues, and emerging trends. Design insights and
recommendations are also presented to support future development and
implementation. This work ultimately try to address three central questions:
Why is ISAC essential for 6G? What innovations does it bring? How will it shape
the future of wireless communication?

Abstract: Caching is crucial in hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks to reduce
latency, optimize throughput, and improve data availability by storing
frequently accessed content closer to users, especially in bandwidth-limited
satellite systems, requiring strategic Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. This
paper addresses throughput optimization in satellite-terrestrial integrated
networks through opportunistic cooperative caching. We propose a joint probing
and scheduling strategy to enhance content retrieval efficiency. The strategy
leverages the LEO satellite to probe satellite-to-ground links and cache states
of multiple cooperative terrestrial stations, enabling dynamic user scheduling
for content delivery. Using an optimal stopping theoretic approach with two
levels of incomplete information, we make real-time decisions on
satellite-terrestrial hybrid links and caching probing. Our threshold-based
strategy optimizes probing and scheduling, significantly improving average
system throughput by exploiting cooperative caching, satellite-terrestrial link
transmission, and time diversity from dynamic user requests. Simulation results
validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed strategies.

Abstract: Holographic MIMO (HMIMO) has emerged as a promising solution for future
wireless systems by enabling ultra-dense, spatially continuous antenna
deployments. While prior studies have primarily focused on electromagnetic (EM)
modeling or simulation-based performance analysis, a rigorous
communication-theoretic framework remains largely unexplored. This paper
presents the first analytical performance study of a multi-user HMIMO downlink
system with matched filter (MF) precoding - a low-complexity baseline scheme.
By incorporating multipath propagation, mutual coupling, and element
excitation, we derive a novel closed-form expression for the MF
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) using an equivalent random
variable model. Leveraging bivariate gamma distributions, we then develop
tractable throughput approximations under full, partial, and no channel state
information (CSI) scenarios. Additionally, we formulate a max-min beamforming
problem to benchmark optimal user fairness performance. Numerical results
validate the accuracy of the proposed framework and reveal that MF precoding
achieves competitive performance with strong robustness to low SINR and CSI
uncertainty.

Abstract: Networked integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has gained significant
attention as a promising technology for enabling next-generation wireless
systems. To further enhance networked ISAC, delegating the reception of sensing
signals to dedicated target monitoring terminals (TMTs) instead of base
stations (BSs) offers significant advantages in terms of sensing capability and
deployment flexibility. Despite its potential, the coordinated beamforming
design for networked integrated communication and time-of-arrival (ToA)-based
multi-TMT localization remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive study to fill this gap. Specifically, we first establish signal
models for both communication and localization, and, for the first time, derive
a closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) to characterize the localization
performance. Subsequently, we exploit this CRLB to formulate two optimization
problems, focusing on sensing-centric and communication-centric criteria,
respectively. For the sensing-centric problem, we develop a globally optimal
algorithm based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) when each BS is equipped with
more antennas than the total number of communication users. While for the
communication-centric problem, we design a globally optimal algorithm for the
single-BS case using bisection search. For the general case of both problems,
we propose a unified successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm,
which is suboptimal yet efficient, and further extend it from single-target
scenarios to more practical multi-target scenarios. Finally, simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, reveal the intrinsic
performance trade-offs between communication and localization, and further show
that deploying more TMTs is always preferable to deploying more BSs in
networked ISAC systems.

Abstract: Unitary matrices are the basis of a large number of signal processing
applications. In many of these applications, finding ways to efficiently store,
and even transmit these matrices, can significantly reduce memory and
throughput requirements. In this work, we study the problem of efficient
transmission and storage of unitary matrices. Specifically, we explicitly
derive a dimensionally-efficient parametrization (DEP) for unitary matrices
that allows identifying them with sequences of real numbers, where the
dimension coincides with the dimension of the unitary group where they lie. We
also characterize its inverse map that allows retrieving the original unitary
matrices from their DEP. The proposed approach effectively allows halving the
dimension with respect to naively considering all the entries of each unitary
matrix, thus reducing the resources required to store and transmit these
matrices. Furthermore, we show that the sequence of real numbers associated to
the proposed DEP is bounded, and we delimit the interval where these numbers
are contained, facilitating the implementation of quantization approaches with
limited distortion. On the other hand, we outline ways to further reduce the
dimension of the DEP when considering more restrictive constraints for matrices
that show up in certain applications. The numerical results showcase the
potential of the proposed approach in general settings, as well as in three
specific applications of current interest for wireless communications research.

Abstract: In this work, we study a multi-user NTN in which a satellite serves as the
primary network and a high-altitude platform station (HAPS) operates as the
secondary network, acting as a cognitive radio. To reduce the cost, complexity,
and power consumption of conventional antenna arrays, we equip the HAPS with a
transmissive BD-RIS antenna front end. We then formulate a joint optimization
problem for the BD-RIS phase response and the HAPS transmit power allocation
under strict per-user interference temperature constraints. To tackle the
resulting highly nonconvex problem, we propose an alternating-optimization
framework: the power-allocation subproblem admits a closed-form,
water-filling-type solution derived from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
conditions, while the BD-RIS configuration is refined via Riemannian manifold
optimization. Simulation results show significant gains in data rate and
interference suppression over diagonal RIS-assisted benchmarks, establishing
BD-RIS as a promising enabler for future multilayer NTNs.

Abstract: One of the main challenges facing Internet of Things (IoT) networks is
managing interference caused by the large number of devices communicating
simultaneously, particularly in multi-cluster networks where multiple devices
simultaneously transmit to their respective receiver. Over-the-Air Computation
(AirComp) has emerged as a promising solution for efficient real-time data
aggregation, yet its performance suffers in dense, interference-limited
environments. To address this, we propose a novel Interference Alignment (IA)
scheme tailored for up-link AirComp systems. Unlike previous approaches, the
proposed method scales to an arbitrary number $\sf K$ of clusters and enables
each cluster to exploit half of the available channels, instead of only
$\tfrac{1}{\sf K}$ as in time-sharing. In addition, we develop schemes tailored
to scenarios where users are shared between adjacent clusters.

Abstract: In every imaging or sensing application, the physical hardware creates
constraints that must be overcome or they limit system performance. Techniques
that leverage additional degrees of freedom can effectively extend performance
beyond the inherent physical capabilities of the hardware. An example includes
synchronizing distributed sensors so as to synthesize a larger aperture for
remote sensing applications. An additional example is integrating the
communication and sensing functions in a wireless system through the clever
design of waveforms and optimized resource management. As these technologies
mature beyond the conceptual and prototype phase they will ultimately
transition to the commercial market. Here, standards play a critical role in
ensuring success. Standards ensure interoperability between systems
manufactured by different vendors and define industry best practices for
vendors and customers alike. The Signal Processing Society of the Institute for
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) plays a leading role in developing
high-quality standards for computational sensing technologies through the
working groups of the Synthetic Aperture Standards Committee (SASC). In this

Abstract: We study how far a diffusion process on a graph can drift from a designed
starting pattern when that pattern is produced using Laplacian regularisation.
Under standard stability conditions for undirected, entrywise nonnegative
graphs, we give a closed-form, instance-specific upper bound on the
steady-state spread, measured as the relative change between the final and
initial profiles. The bound separates two effects: (i) an irreducible term
determined by the graph's maximum node degree, and (ii) a design-controlled
term that shrinks as the regularisation strength increases (following an
inverse square-root law). This leads to a simple design rule: given any target
limit on spread, one can choose a sufficient regularisation strength in closed
form. Although one motivating application is array beamforming, where the
initial pattern is the squared magnitude of the beamformer weights, the result
applies to any scenario that first enforces Laplacian smoothness and then
evolves by linear diffusion on a graph. Overall, the guarantee is
non-asymptotic, easy to compute, and certifies how much steady-state deviation
can occur.
