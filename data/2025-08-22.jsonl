To put it into\npractice, we construct a CTR model named SUAN (Stacked Unified Attention\nNetwork). In SUAN, we propose the UAB as a behavior sequence encoder. A single\nUAB unifies the modeling of the sequential and non-sequential features and also\nmeasures the importance of each user behavior feature from multiple\nperspectives. Stacked UABs elevate the configuration to a high grade, paving\nthe way for performance improvement. In order to benefit from the high\nperformance of the high-grade SUAN and avoid the disadvantage of its long\ninference time, we modify the SUAN with sparse self-attention and parallel\ninference strategies to form LightSUAN, and then adopt online distillation to\ntrain the low-grade LightSUAN, taking a high-grade SUAN as a teacher. The\ndistilled LightSUAN has superior performance but the same inference time as the\nLightSUAN, making it well-suited for online deployment. Experimental results\nshow that SUAN performs exceptionally well and holds the scaling laws spanning\nthree orders of magnitude in model grade and data size, and the distilled\nLightSUAN outperforms the SUAN configured with one grade higher.

However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of\nhyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often\ndifficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts\nhave been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide\nrange of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we\nintroduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art\noptimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size\nhyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto\nand Xiao, 2024].

This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs\nagainst base models concerning monosemanticity.

Using\nGemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs\nreduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability.

To assess practical utility, we evaluate\nconcept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and\npartial suppression.

With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed\nvector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing\npipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most\nsignificantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk\nof memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.\nPreliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of\nHDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages\nwith scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work\nwith the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual\nprocedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative\nimprovement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we\nwill continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to\nimprove the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully\ntest this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models\nthat use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of\nHDM given the advantages of the system."}

Our method, implemented using PyTorch, was tested\non clustering and classification tasks. The results show that our approach\noutperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI\ndatasets. While computationally intensive due to overlap condition\ncalculations, the proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in\ndecentralized data processing."}

While promising, such methods often\nunderperform in practice compared to well-tuned ID-based baselines like SASRec.\nIn this paper, we identify two key limitations holding back generative\napproaches: the lack of collaborative signal in item tokenization, and\ninefficiencies in the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture. To address\nthese issues, we introduce COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that\nintegrates collaborative information directly into the learned item\nrepresentations, jointly optimizing for both content reconstruction and\nrecommendation relevance. Additionally, we propose MARIUS, a lightweight,\naudio-inspired generative model that decouples timeline modeling from item\ndecoding.

Models trained on our\ncurricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10\npercentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is\nbeneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric\nnotion of difficulty is adopted."}

However, excessively long chains can lead to\noverthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a\nquestion: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes\nbased on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks\nframework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by\npartitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main\ncontributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in\nwhich the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of\nblocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive\nmodel through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided\nDirect Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its\nreasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count\nto dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible\nadjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment."}

Designed with research and practical applications in mind,\nAgentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In\nthis framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used\ninternally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics\nencourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting\nprompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by\nLLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when\ntypes are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the\napplicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question\nanswering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization\ntasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without\nsacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at\n\\texttt{https://github.com/IBM/agentics}."}

While prior\nwork typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward\nsignals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent\ncontributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we\ninvestigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted\nthat are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing\nthe policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents\ntend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the\nlikelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a\nmethod based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each\nagent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.\nSpecifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies\nby assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis\nacross cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to\nwhich agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects\nbetween policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent\nbehaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic\ndecisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed\nmethod offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances\nexplainability in MARL systems."}

We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel\nframework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently\noptimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual\ngradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization\nby providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration\ninterdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that\nproposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an\nOptimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving\nfeedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT\ndemonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,\nachieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability."}
