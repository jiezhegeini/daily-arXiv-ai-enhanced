Deep learning-based\napproaches have achieved strong performance but typically rely heavily on\nextensive training data and often fail to generalize to unseen signals. In this\npaper, we propose a method to learn discriminative embeddings without relying\non real-world RF signal recordings by training on signals of synthetic wireless\nprotocols. We validate the approach on a dataset of real RF signals and show\nthat the learned embeddings capture features enabling accurate discrimination\nof previously unseen real-world signals, highlighting its potential for robust\nRF signal classification and anomaly detection."}

Specifically, active users randomly choose an SCMA codebook\nto access the communication network in an arbitrary time slot whenever they\nwant without scheduling. However, due to the lack of central coordination in\nthe proposed URA scheme, SCMA codebook collisions become inevitable, making\ndecoding challenging and leading to increased access failures. To cope with the\ndecoding issue, an interference-canceling (IC) first decoding strategy is\nproposed at the access point (AP), which can partially tackles collision\nproblems, contributing to a higher system throughput. Taking the proposed\nIC-first decoding strategy into account, a closed-form theoretical expression\nof the throughput is derived. Moreover, to alleviate the throughput degradation\nunder the congested user traffic, a user barring mechanism is introduced to\nmanage the traffic load. Firstly, a closed-form expression of idle codebook\nprobability is developed to help indicate the system state, i.e., congested or\nnot. Then, in addition to the estimated real-time load, the AP adaptively\nadjusts the access probability and redistributes the actual access load.\nFinally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SCMA-empowered URA\nscheme enjoys higher maximum throughput, compared to the conventional\northogonal multiple access (OMA) based URA scheme. Moreover, the accuracy of\nthe presented theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the user barring\nmechanism are verified."}

In conventional\nspace-only SIM architectures, the rate of reconfigurability of the SIM is equal\nto the inverse of the channel coherence time. This paper investigates a novel\nbeamforming strategy for massive downlink connectivity using a randomized\nspace-time (ST) coded SIM. In addition to conventional space-only metasurface\nlayers, the proposed design integrates a ST metasurface layer at the input\nstage of the SIM that introduces random time variations over each channel\ncoherence time interval. These artificial time variations enable opportunistic\nuser scheduling and exploitation of multiuser diversity under slow channel\ndynamics. To mitigate the prohibitive overhead associated with full channel\nstate information at the transmitter (CSIT), we propose a partial-CSIT-based\nbeamforming scheme that leverages randomized steering vectors and limited\nuser-side feedback based on signal quality measurements. Numerical results\ndemonstrate that the proposed ST-SIM architecture achieves satisfactory\nsum-rate performance while significantly reducing CSIT acquisition and feedback\noverhead, thereby enabling scalable downlink connectivity in dense networks."}

We consider two waveguides, one\ndedicated to transmission and one to reception, and both of them are connected\nto a base station (BS). Each type of waveguide consists of several pinching\nantennas (PAs) in some preconfigured positions. In this framework, we assume\nthe BS can serve downlink and uplink user equipments (UEs) at the same time\nusing the same spectrum resources through the presented PASS. In this aspect,\nwe formulate a sum rate optimization problem that jointly optimizes the antenna\nactivation factor, the BS transmit power, and the UE's transmit power, subject\nto power budget constraints for the BS and the UEs, as well as minimum rate\nrequirements for the UEs. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and\ndifficult to solve directly. Hence, we divide the main problem into two\nsub-problems: the antenna activation sub-problem and the power allocation\nsub-problem. Then, we solve the antenna activation problem utilizing a distance\nand spatial correlation-based algorithm. Meanwhile, the resource allocation\nproblem is solved using a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based\nalgorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed framework can achieve\naround 60-90\\% performance gains over its time division duplex (TDD) where the\nuplink and downlink transmissions are served in different orthogonal time\nslots."}
