Existing approaches often\ndepend on limited labeled datasets, which restricts their ability to generalize\nto rare or unseen disturbances. This paper proposes a novel framework that\nintegrates generative modeling, sliding-window temporal processing, and\ndecision fusion to achieve robust event detection and classification using\nsynchrophasor data. A variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network is\nemployed to model normal operating conditions, where both reconstruction error\nand discriminator error are extracted as anomaly indicators. Two complementary\ndecision strategies are developed: a threshold-based rule for computational\nefficiency and a convex hull-based method for robustness under complex error\ndistributions. These features are organized into spatiotemporal detection and\nclassification matrices through a sliding-window mechanism, and an\nidentification and decision fusion stage integrates the outputs across PMUs.\nThis design enables the framework to identify known events while systematically\nclassifying previously unseen disturbances into a new category, addressing a\nkey limitation of supervised classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art accuracy, surpassing machine learning, deep learning, and\nenvelope-based baselines. The ability to recognize unknown events further\nhighlights the adaptability and practical value of the proposed approach for\nwide-area event analysis in modern power systems."}

The central idea is to place a device called Stentrode\nin the brain's vasculature, which enables neuromodulation and helps patients\nregain the ability to communicate. However, in such devices, the battery and\nelectronics are wired and could introduce damage or implant malfunction. In\nthese cases, a Stentrode integrated with magnetoelectric (ME) antennas could be\nof great interest. ME antennas offer significant advantages over traditional\nantennas, leveraging acoustic resonance rather than electromagnetic resonance\nto achieve a size reduction of up to five orders of magnitude. In addition to\ntheir compactness and immunity to ground-plane interference, ME antennas could\nbe adopted for use in vascular implants, such as coronary stents, potentially\nenabling minimally invasive monitoring and communication.

If (i) the OTA fixture characteristics are known, and\n(ii) the number of independent measurements at the accessible antennas is\nsufficient, the OTA fixture can be de-embedded to recover the DUT\ncharacteristics. In recent prior work, we solved (i) by connecting the NDA\nantennas to a specific known tunable load network (TLN). Here, we tackle (ii)\nby additionally using the TLN to provide measurement diversity. The connection\nbetween OTA fixture and TLN constitutes a programmable fixture (PF). When the\nDUT characteristics cannot be identified based on a single PF realization, we\nadd measurement diversity with multiple PF realizations. The underlying\n\"multiplexed de-embedding\" achieves the joint de-embedding of an ensemble of PF\nrealizations when a single PF realization cannot be de-embedded. We\nexperimentally demonstrate our concept by remotely estimating the scattering\nmatrix of a reciprocal, non-unitary 4-port DUT (10 complex-valued unknowns) via\na rich-scattering OTA fixture purely based on measurements of a single\ntransmission coefficient between two accessible antennas across 30 different PF\nrealizations. We systematically study the trade-off between the number of\nindependent measurements at the accessible antennas and the number of PF\nrealizations. Multiplexed de-embedding of the OTA fixture paves the path to\nimplementing wireless multi-port sensing with low hardware complexity in areas\nlike RFID and wireless bioelectronics."}

However, prevailing RSS-based methods often\ndepend on complex computational algorithms or specialized hardware, rendering\nthem impractical for low-cost access points. To address these challenges, this\npaper introduces buffer-aided RMSProp (BARProp), a fast and memory-efficient\nlocalization algorithm specifically designed for RSS-based tasks. The key\ninnovation of BARProp lies in a novel mechanism that dynamically adapts the\ndecay factor by monitoring the energy variations of recent gradients stored in\na buffer, thereby achieving both accelerated convergence and enhanced\nstability. Furthermore, BARProp requires less than 15% of the memory used by\nstate-of-the-art methods. Extensive evaluations with real-world data\ndemonstrate that BARProp not only achieves higher localization accuracy but\nalso delivers at least a fourfold improvement in convergence speed compared to\nexisting benchmarks."}

This study introduces a novel two-port impedance model\nto estimate the behavior of a converse Magnetoelectric (cME) sensor. This model\nprovides a possible framework for calculating transfer functions and simulating\nmagnetometer behavior in both continuous- and discrete-time simulation\nenvironments, and it is also possibly transferable to other magnetometer types.\nCommon S-parameters were measured experimentally using an impedance analyzer\nand converted to Z-parameters to create a transfer function for system-level\nsimulations. The model was validated through an analysis of output-related\nnoise using MATLAB and LTSpice simulations to optimize the noise of the analog\ncircuit parts of the system. The simulation results were compared with\nexperimental measurements using a Zurich Instruments lock-in amplifier and the\ncustom-designed low-noise printed circuit board (PCB) under model\nconsiderations. The proposed methodology derives noise considerations and the\ntransfer function of a magnetometer. These are essential for readout schemes\nfor mixed-signal circuit design.

Traditional methods, such as empirical\nmodel-based optimization algorithms, are hindered by excessive measurement\nrequirements and suboptimal solutions, while machine learning (ML) approaches\noften struggle with complex tunnel environments. This paper proposes a deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) driven framework that integrates parabolic wave\nequation (PWE) channel modeling, conditional generative adversarial network\n(cGAN) based data augmentation, and a dueling deep Q network (Dueling DQN) for\nAP placement optimization. The PWE method generates high-fidelity path loss\ndistributions for a subset of AP positions, which are then expanded by the cGAN\nto create high resolution path loss maps for all candidate positions,\nsignificantly reducing simulation costs while maintaining physical accuracy. In\nthe DRL framework, the state space captures AP positions and coverage, the\naction space defines AP adjustments, and the reward function encourages signal\nimprovement while penalizing deployment costs. The dueling DQN enhances\nconvergence speed and exploration exploitation balance, increasing the\nlikelihood of reaching optimal configurations. Comparative experiments show\nthat the proposed method outperforms a conventional Hooke Jeeves optimizer and\ntraditional DQN, delivering AP configurations with higher average received\npower, better worst-case coverage, and improved computational efficiency. This\nwork integrates high-fidelity electromagnetic simulation, generative modeling,\nand AI-driven optimization, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution for\nnext-generation CBTC systems in complex tunnel environments."}
