In this work, we present COMET, a framework of CNN designs that\nemploy efficient hardware offset-binary coding (OBC) techniques to enable\nco-optimization of performance and resource utilization. The approach\nformulates CNN inference with OBC representations of inputs (Scheme A) and\nweights (Scheme B) separately, enabling exploitation of bit-width asymmetry.\nThe shift-accumulate operation is modified by incorporating the offset term\nwith the pre-scaled bias. Leveraging inherent symmetries in Schemes A and B, we\nintroduce four novel look-up table (LUT) techniques -- parallel, shared, split,\nand hybrid -- and analyze them to identify the most efficient options. Building\non this foundation, we develop an OBC-based general matrix multiplication core\nusing the im2col transformation, enabling efficient acceleration of a\nfixed-point modified LeNet-5 model.

To maximize ASC, we further design two algorithms: a grid search (GS)\nmethod and a gradient descent (GD) method. Numerical results reveal that the\nVBCM-based approach not only provides reliable insights into FAS security\nperformance, but also yields substantial gains -- ASC improvements exceeding\n$120\\%$ in high-threat scenarios and $18$--$19\\%$ performance enhancements for\ncompact antenna configurations.

Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) the PASS assisted\ncell-free systems achieve superior performance over benchmark schemes; 2)\nincreasing the number of PAs per waveguides can improve the advantage of PASS\nassisted cell-free systems; and 3) the cell-free architecture mitigates the\naverage user rate degradation as the number of users increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5929\u7ebf\u7f29\u653e\u6280\u672f\uff08PASS\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u548c\u901f\u7387\u6700\u5927\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5929\u7ebf\u7f29\u653e\u6280\u672f\uff08PASS\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\uff08AO\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u5b57\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u91c7\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08WMMSE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u5929\u7ebf\u7f29\u653e\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u5219\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u9010\u5143\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09PASS\u8f85\u52a9\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\uff1b2\uff09\u589e\u52a0\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6ce2\u5bfc\u7ba1\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aPASS\u8f85\u52a9\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b3\uff09\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u7528\u6237\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7528\u6237\u901f\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "PASS\u8f85\u52a9\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

The bandwidth availability and diversity of FR3 offer\nunprecedented opportunities for coherent multiband Integrated Sensing and\nCommunications (ISAC), which aggregates the carrier phase information from\nmultiple frequency bands to increase the sensing resolution to the cm-level.\nHowever, the frequency anisotropy of sensing targets over GHz-wide bands and\nthe non-contiguity of the 6G spectrum, pose critical challenges to the\napplication of existing multiband ISAC techniques.

The proposed method is a computationally efficient,\ntwo-stage estimator that fuses time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) and\nfrequency-difference-of-arrival (FDOA) measurements with a minimal number of\nsensors. CLEAR localizes a moving source in N-dimensional space using only N+1\nsensors, achieving the theoretical minimum sensor count. The first stage\nintroduces auxiliary range and range-rate parameters to construct a set of\npseudo-linear equations, solved via weighted least squares. An algebraic\nelimination using Sylvester's resultant then reduces the problem to a quartic\nequation, yielding closed-form estimates for the nuisance variables.

However, trained ML\nmodels often fail to generalize under domain shifts when training and test data\ndistributions are different because they often focus on modality-specific\nspurious features. In practical wireless systems, domain shifts occur\nfrequently due to dynamic channel statistics, moving obstacles, or hardware\nconfiguration. Thus, there is a need for learning frameworks that can achieve\nrobust generalization under scarce multi-modal data in wireless networks. In\nthis paper, a novel and data-efficient two-phase learning framework is proposed\nto improve generalization performance in unseen and unfamiliar wireless\nenvironments with minimal amount of multi-modal data. In the first stage, a\nphysics-based loss function is employed to enable each BS to learn the physics\nunderlying its wireless environment captured by multi-modal data. The\ndata-efficiency of the physics-based loss function is analytically\ninvestigated. In the second stage, collaborative domain adaptation is proposed\nto leverage the wireless environment knowledge of multiple BSs to guide\nunder-performing BSs under domain shift. Specifically, domain-similarity-aware\nmodel aggregation is proposed to utilize the knowledge of BSs that experienced\nsimilar domains. To validate the proposed framework, a new dataset generation\nframework is developed by integrating CARLA and MATLAB-based mmWave channel\nmodeling to predict mmWave RSS. Simulation results show that the proposed\nphysics-based training requires only 13% of data samples to achieve the same\nperformance as a state-of-the-art baseline that does not use physics-based\ntraining. Moreover, the proposed collaborative domain adaptation needs only 25%\nof data samples and 20% of FLOPs to achieve the convergence compared to\nbaselines."}

We present a theoretical framework\nsupported by finite element method simulations and experiments with wearable\ndevices. Results show that metallic objects within 20 cm of devices can reduce\ntransmission loss by about 10 dB. When a device ground connects to a grounded\nmetallic object, channel gain can increase by at least 20 dB.

Integrated sensing and communication\n(ISAC) is a key concept in this evolution, enabling end-to-end support for both\ncommunication and sensing within a unified framework. It enhances spectrum\nefficiency, reduces latency, and supports diverse use cases, including smart\ncities, autonomous systems, and perceptive environments.

To further enhance networked ISAC, delegating the reception of sensing\nsignals to dedicated target monitoring terminals (TMTs) instead of base\nstations (BSs) offers significant advantages in terms of sensing capability and\ndeployment flexibility. Despite its potential, the coordinated beamforming\ndesign for networked integrated communication and time-of-arrival (ToA)-based\nmulti-TMT localization remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive study to fill this gap. Specifically, we first establish signal\nmodels for both communication and localization, and, for the first time, derive\na closed-form Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) to characterize the localization\nperformance. Subsequently, we exploit this CRLB to formulate two optimization\nproblems, focusing on sensing-centric and communication-centric criteria,\nrespectively. For the sensing-centric problem, we develop a globally optimal\nalgorithm based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) when each BS is equipped with\nmore antennas than the total number of communication users. While for the\ncommunication-centric problem, we design a globally optimal algorithm for the\nsingle-BS case using bisection search. For the general case of both problems,\nwe propose a unified successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm,\nwhich is suboptimal yet efficient, and further extend it from single-target\nscenarios to more practical multi-target scenarios. Finally, simulation results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, reveal the intrinsic\nperformance trade-offs between communication and localization, and further show\nthat deploying more TMTs is always preferable to deploying more BSs in\nnetworked ISAC systems."}

In many of these applications, finding ways to efficiently store,\nand even transmit these matrices, can significantly reduce memory and\nthroughput requirements. In this work, we study the problem of efficient\ntransmission and storage of unitary matrices. Specifically, we explicitly\nderive a dimensionally-efficient parametrization (DEP) for unitary matrices\nthat allows identifying them with sequences of real numbers, where the\ndimension coincides with the dimension of the unitary group where they lie. We\nalso characterize its inverse map that allows retrieving the original unitary\nmatrices from their DEP. The proposed approach effectively allows halving the\ndimension with respect to naively considering all the entries of each unitary\nmatrix, thus reducing the resources required to store and transmit these\nmatrices. Furthermore, we show that the sequence of real numbers associated to\nthe proposed DEP is bounded, and we delimit the interval where these numbers\nare contained, facilitating the implementation of quantization approaches with\nlimited distortion. On the other hand, we outline ways to further reduce the\ndimension of the DEP when considering more restrictive constraints for matrices\nthat show up in certain applications. The numerical results showcase the\npotential of the proposed approach in general settings, as well as in three\nspecific applications of current interest for wireless communications research."}

We then formulate a joint optimization\nproblem for the BD-RIS phase response and the HAPS transmit power allocation\nunder strict per-user interference temperature constraints. To tackle the\nresulting highly nonconvex problem, we propose an alternating-optimization\nframework: the power-allocation subproblem admits a closed-form,\nwater-filling-type solution derived from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)\nconditions, while the BD-RIS configuration is refined via Riemannian manifold\noptimization.
