Recent work has integrated rectified linear unit (ReLU) techniques to enhance existing recovery algorithms. We merge Newton-type thresholding with ReLU-based approaches to propose two algorithms: Newton-Direction-Based ReLU-Thresholding (NDRT) and its enhanced variant, Newton-Direction-Based ReLU-Thresholding Pursuit (NDRTP). Theoretical analysis iindicates that both algorithms can guarantee exact recovery of nonnegative sparse signals when the measurement matrix satisfies a certain condition.. Numerical experiments demonstrate NDRTP achieves competitive performance compared to several existing methods in both noisy and noiseless scenarios."}

To address this bottleneck, this paper proposes NeuroSleep, an integrated event-driven sensing and inference system for energy-efficient sleep staging. NeuroSleep first converts raw EEG into complementary multi-scale bipolar event streams using Residual Adaptive Multi-Scale Delta Modulation (R-AMSDM), enabling an explicit fidelity-sparsity trade-off at the sensing front end. Furthermore, NeuroSleep adopts a hierarchical inference architecture that comprises an Event-based Adaptive Multi-scale Response (EAMR) module for local feature extraction, a Local Temporal-Attention Module (LTAM) for context aggregation, and an Epoch-Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ELIF) module to capture long-term state persistence. Experimental results using subject-independent 5-fold cross-validation on the Sleep-EDF Expanded dataset demonstrate that NeuroSleep achieves a mean accuracy of 74.2% with only 0.932 M parameters while reducing sparsity-adjusted effective operations by approximately 53.6% relative to dense processing. Compared with the representative dense Transformer baseline, NeuroSleep improves accuracy by 7.5% with a 45.8% reduction in computational load. By bridging neuromorphic encoding with state-aware modeling, NeuroSleep provides a scalable solution for always-on sleep analysis in resource-constrained wearable scenarios."}

However, its layer-by-layer process remains vulnerable to faults such as nozzle clogging, filament runout, and layer misalignment, which compromise print quality and reliability. Traditional inspection methods are costly, time-intensive, and often limited to post-process analysis, making them unsuitable for real-time intervention. In this current study, the authors developed a novel, low-cost, and portable faultdetection system that leverages multimodal sensor fusion and artificial intelligence for real-time monitoring in FDM-based 3D printing. The system integrates acoustic, vibration, and thermal sensing into a non-intrusive architecture, capturing complementary data streams that reflect both mechanical and process-related anomalies. Acoustic and thermal sensors operate in a fully contactless manner, while the vibration sensor requires minimal attachment such that it will not interfere with printer hardware, thereby preserving portability and ease of deployment. The multimodal signals are processed into spectrograms and time-frequency features, which are classified using convolutional neural networks for intelligent fault detection. The proposed system advances Industry 4.0 objectives by offering an affordable, scalable, and practical monitoring solution that improves faultdetection accuracy, reduces waste, and supports sustainable, adaptive manufacturing."}

By capturing and classifying acoustic emissions during the printing process, we aim to identify common faults such as nozzle clogging, filament breakage, pully skipping and various other mechanical faults. Utilizing Convolutional neural networks, we implement algorithms capable of real-time audio classification to detect these faults promptly. Our methodology involves conducting a series of controlled experiments to gather audio data, followed by the application of advanced machine learning models for fault detection. Additionally, we review existing literature on audio-based fault detection in manufacturing and 3D printing to contextualize our research within the broader field. Preliminary results demonstrate that audio signals, when analyzed with machine learning techniques, provide a reliable and cost-effective means of enhancing real-time fault detection."}

For moving machinery, vibration analysis and control are crucial. Additive manufacturing is the basis of 3D printing, which utilizes mechanical movement of the extruder to fabricate objects, and faults occur due to unwanted vibrations. Therefore, it is vital to examine the vibration patterns of a 3D printer. In this work, we observe these parameters of an FDM printer, exemplified by the MakerBot Method X. To analyze the system, it is necessary to understand the motion it generates and select appropriate sensors to detect those motions. The sensor measurement values can be used to determine the condition of the printer. We used an accelerometer and an acoustic sensor to measure the vibration and sound produced by the printer. The outputs from these sensors were examined individually. The findings show that vibration occurs at relatively low levels during continuous motion because it mainly appears at component transition edges. Due to abrupt acceleration and deceleration during zigzag motion, vibration reaches its peak."}

A data-processing framework, called SeaSpoofFinder, available here: seaspooffinder.github.io/ais_data, was developed to ingest and post-process global AIS streams and to detect candidate anomalies through a two-stage procedure. In Stage 1, implausible position jumps are identified using kinematic and data-quality filters; in Stage 2, events are retained only when multiple vessels exhibit spatially consistent source and target clustering, thereby reducing false positives from single-vessel artifacts. The resulting final potential spoofing events (FPSEs) reveal recurrent patterns in several regions, including the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, Murmansk, Moscow, and the Haifa area, with affected footprints that can span large maritime areas. The analysis also highlights recurring non-spoofing artifacts (e.g., back-to-port jumps and data gaps) that can still pass heuristic filters in dense traffic regions. These results indicate that AIS-based monitoring can provide useful evidence for identifying and characterizing potential spoofing activity at scale, while emphasizing that AIS-only evidence does not provide definitive attribution."}

Still, it comes at a cost of inherent nonlinearities, geometry-dependent noise, and suboptimal weighting in conventional linear estimators that might limit accuracy. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based approach using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to directly map RSS-AoA measurements to 3D positions, capturing nonlinear relationships that are difficult to model with traditional methods. We evaluate the impact of input representation by comparing networks trained on raw measurements versus preprocessed features derived from a linearization method. Simulation results show that the learning-based approach consistently outperforms existing linear methods under RSS noise across all noise levels, and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance under increasing AoA noise. Furthermore, preprocessing measurements using the linearization method provides a clear advantage over raw data, demonstrating the benefit of geometry-aware feature extraction."}

We propose a two-stage ISAC protocol, in which the preparation phase performs direction estimation for outdoor users located in the reflection space, while maintaining communication with both outdoor and indoor users in the transmission space. The subsequent communication phase exploits the estimated directions to enhance information transfer. The directions of outdoor users are modeled as Gaussian random variables to capture estimation uncertainty, and the corresponding average communication performance is incorporated into the design. Building on this framework, we formulate a performance-balanced optimization problem that maximizes the communication sum-rate while guaranteeing the required sensing accuracy, jointly determining the beamforming vectors at the base station (BS), the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficients, and the metasurface partition between energy-splitting and transmit-only modes. The physical constraints of STAR-RIS elements and the required sensing performance are explicitly enforced. To address the non-convex nature of the problem, we combine fractional programming, Lagrangian dual reformulation, and successive convex approximation. The binary metasurface partition is ultimately recovered via continuous relaxation followed by projection-based binarization. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design achieves an effective trade-off between sensing accuracy and communication throughput, by significantly outperforming conventional STAR-RIS-aided ISAC schemes."}

Since conventional methods typically reconstruct the original signal by estimating the differences of the residual signal and computing their cumulative sum, each estimation error inevitably propagates through subsequent time samples. In this paper, to eliminate this error-propagation problem, we propose an algorithm that reconstructs the residual signal directly. The proposed method takes advantage of the high-frequency characteristics of the modulo samples and the sparsity of both the residual signal and its difference. Simulation results show that the proposed method reconstructs the original signal more accurately than a conventional method based on the differences of the residual signal."}

While methods for time and frequency synchronization are well established, maintaining real-time phase coherence remains an open requirement for many MIMO systems. Phase coherence in MIMO systems is crucial for beamforming in digital arrays and enables precise parameter estimates such as Angle-of-Arrival/Departure. This work presents and validates a simple local real-time phase calibration method for a digital array. We compare two different approaches, instantaneous and smoothed calibration, to determine the optimal interval between synchronization procedures. To quantitatively assess calibration performance, we use two metrics: the average beamforming power loss and the RMS cycle-to-cycle jitter. Our results indicate that both approaches for phase calibration are effective and yield RMS of jitter in the 2.1 ps to 124 fs range for different SDR models. This level of precision enables coherent transmission on commonly available SDR platforms, allowing investigation on advanced MIMO techniques and transmit beamforming in practical testbeds."}

We evaluate resilience using two key metrics: the minimum-user spectral efficiency, which captures worst-case user performance, and the outage probability, defined as the fraction of users left without any active APs. Simulation results show that FAAS maintains significantly better performance under failure conditions compared to failure-agnostic clustering. At high failure levels, FAAS reduces outage by over 85\\% and improves worst-case user rates.

Wavefront tomography is a technique that uses multiple wavefront measurements from various viewing angles to non-invasively measure the 3D density field of a turbulent medium. Existing methods make strong assumptions, such as a spline basis representation, to address the ill-conditioned nature of this problem. We formulate this problem as a Bayesian, sparse-view tomographic reconstruction problem and develop a model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm for measuring the volumetric 3D density field inside a wind tunnel. We call this method WindDensity-MBIR and apply it using simulated data to difficult reconstruction scenarios with sparse data, small projection field of view, and limited angular extent. WindDensity-MBIR can recover high-order features in these scenarios within 10% to 25% error even when the tip, tilt, and piston are removed from the wavefront measurements."}

The system consists of two stages: the phase selector of RIS and the extraction of respiration rate. To mitigate synchronization-induced common phase drifts, the difference of Möbius transformation (DMT) is integrated into the deep learning framework, named DMTNet, to jointly configure multiple active RIS elements. Notably, the training data are generated in simulation without collecting real-world measurements, and the resulting phase selector is validated experimentally. For sensing, multi-antenna measurements are fused by the DC-offset calibration and the DeepMining-MMV processing with CA-CFAR detection and Newton's refinements. Prototype experiments indicate that active RIS deployment improves respiration detectability while simultaneously enabling higher-order modulation; without RIS, respiration detection is unreliable and only lower-order modulation is supported."}
