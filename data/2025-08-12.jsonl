A Deep Dive into Whole vs. Individual Modalities", "comment": null, "summary": "Multimodal recommendation (MMRec) has emerged as a mainstream paradigm,\ntypically leveraging text and visual embeddings extracted from pre-trained\nmodels such as Sentence-BERT, Vision Transformers, and ResNet. This approach is\nfounded on the intuitive assumption that incorporating multimodal embeddings\ncan enhance recommendation performance. However, despite its popularity, this\nassumption lacks comprehensive empirical verification. This presents a critical\nresearch gap. To address it, we pose the central research question of this\npaper: Are multimodal embeddings truly beneficial for recommendation? To answer\nthis question, we conduct a large-scale empirical study examining the role of\ntext and visual embeddings in modern MMRec models, both as a whole and\nindividually. Specifically, we pose two key research questions: (1) Do\nmultimodal embeddings as a whole improve recommendation performance? (2) Is\neach individual modality - text and image - useful when used alone? To isolate\nthe effect of individual modalities - text or visual - we employ a modality\nknockout strategy by setting the corresponding embeddings to either constant\nvalues or random noise. To ensure the scale and comprehensiveness of our study,\nwe evaluate 14 widely used state-of-the-art MMRec models. Our findings reveal\nthat: (1) multimodal embeddings generally enhance recommendation performance -\nparticularly when integrated through more sophisticated graph-based fusion\nmodels.

Our\nfindings show that LLMs can effectively perform semantic and sentiment\nannotation across large oral history collections when guided by well-designed\nprompts. This study provides a reusable annotation pipeline and practical\nguidance for applying LLMs in culturally sensitive archival analysis.

However, these models face inherent limitations in handling\nmulti-modal reasoning, semantic abstraction, and interactive decision-making.\nWhile recent advances have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) into remote\nsensing workflows, existing studies primarily focus on downstream applications,\nlacking a unified theoretical framework that explains the cognitive role of\nlanguage. This review advocates a paradigm shift from vision-centered to\nlanguage-centered remote sensing interpretation. Drawing inspiration from the\nGlobal Workspace Theory (GWT) of human cognition, We propose a\nlanguage-centered framework for remote sensing interpretation that treats LLMs\nas the cognitive central hub integrating perceptual, task, knowledge and action\nspaces to enable unified understanding, reasoning, and decision-making. We\nfirst explore the potential of LLMs as the central cognitive component in\nremote sensing interpretation, and then summarize core technical challenges,\nincluding unified multimodal representation, knowledge association, and\nreasoning and decision-making. Furthermore, we construct a global\nworkspace-driven interpretation mechanism and review how language-centered\nsolutions address each challenge. Finally, we outline future research\ndirections from four perspectives: adaptive alignment of multimodal data, task\nunderstanding under dynamic knowledge constraints, trustworthy reasoning, and\nautonomous interaction. This work aims to provide a conceptual foundation for\nthe next generation of remote sensing interpretation systems and establish a\nroadmap toward cognition-driven intelligent geospatial analysis."}

The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for\nmechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of\nindividual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as\nneural networks.\n  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively\nencode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of\ntwo Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that\ncan be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR). The corresponding USM\ncoordinates can be used to compute a Chebyshev distance metric as well as k-mer\nfrequencies, without having to recompute the embedded numeric coordinates, and,\nparadoxically, allowing for non-integers values of k.\n  Results: This report advances the bijective fractal encoding by Universal\nSequence Maps (USM) by resolving seeding biases affecting the iterated process.\nThe resolution had two results, the first expected, the second an intriguing\noutcome: 1) full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity;\nand 2) uncovering the nature of USM as an efficient numeric process converging\ntowards a steady state sequence embedding solution.

To avoid data meaning being\neavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming\nsignals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic\ninformation. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for\nsemantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not\ncommunicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit\npower of the jammer.

Quality Estimation (QE) for Machine\nTranslation (MT), which assesses the quality of a source-target pair without\nrelying on reference translations, remains a challenging cross-lingual task for\nLLMs. The challenges stem from the inherent limitations of existing LLM-based\nQE systems, which are pre-trained for causal language modelling rather than\nregression-specific tasks, further elevated by the presence of low-resource\nlanguages given pre-training data distribution. This paper introduces ALOPE, an\nadaptive layer-optimization framework designed to enhance LLM-based QE by\nrestructuring Transformer representations through layer-wise adaptation for\nimproved regression-based prediction. Our framework integrates low-rank\nadapters (LoRA) with regression task heads, leveraging selected pre-trained\nTransformer layers for improved cross-lingual alignment. In addition to the\nlayer-specific adaptation, ALOPE introduces two strategies-dynamic weighting,\nwhich adaptively combines representations from multiple layers, and multi-head\nregression, which aggregates regression losses from multiple heads for QE. Our\nframework shows improvements over various existing LLM-based QE approaches.\nEmpirical evidence suggests that intermediate Transformer layers in LLMs\nprovide contextual representations that are more aligned with the cross-lingual\nnature of the QE task. We make resultant models and framework code publicly\navailable for further research, also allowing existing LLM-based MT frameworks\nto be scaled with QE capabilities."}

Prior work has shown that ICL emerges in transformers due to\nthe presence of special circuits called induction heads. Given the equivalence\nbetween induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling\nsequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of\nmodel depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can\nefficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart\ncannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large. However, for higher\norder Markov sources, the best known constructions require at least three\nlayers (each with a single attention head) - leaving open the question: can a\ntwo-layer single-head transformer represent any kth-order Markov process? In\nthis paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer\ntransformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional\nk-gram. Thus, our result provides the tightest known characterization of the\ninterplay between transformer depth and Markov order for ICL.

However, our\nempirical and theoretical analyses reveal that unobserved environmental\nconfounders (e.g., exposure or popularity biases) in candidate pools may cause\nheuristic sampling methods to introduce false hard negatives (FHNS). These\nmisleading samples can encourage the model to learn spurious correlations\ninduced by such confounders, ultimately compromising its generalization ability\nunder distribution shifts. To address this issue, we propose a novel method\nnamed Causal Negative Sampling via Diffusion (CNSDiff). By synthesizing\nnegative samples in the latent space via a conditional diffusion process,\nCNSDiff avoids the bias introduced by predefined candidate pools and thus\nreduces the likelihood of generating FHNS. Moreover, it incorporates a causal\nregularization term to explicitly mitigate the influence of environmental\nconfounders during the negative sampling process, leading to robust negatives\nthat promote out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.

Furthermore, our analysis on the iteration complexity of specific\nstochastic interpolant constructions provides optimized schedules to enhance\ncomputational efficiency. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by\nnumerical experiments, which validate the derived error bounds and complexity\nanalyses."}

We conduct an empirical\nanalysis of self-bias on a large dataset (>5000 prompt-completion pairs)\nconsisting of expert human annotations and judgments from nine different LLM\njudges. We find that some models, such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet,\nsystematically assign higher scores to their own outputs.

A key challenge underlying this limitation is the\nmodality gap between speech and text representations.

We characterize the\nconditions under which multiple experts can benefit from the conformal sets.\nWith the insight that only certain experts may be relevant for each instance,\nwe explore the problem of subset selection and introduce a greedy algorithm\nthat utilizes conformal sets to identify the subset of expert predictions that\nwill be used in classifying an instance. This approach is shown to yield better\nperformance compared to naive methods for human subset selection. Based on real\nexpert predictions from the CIFAR-10H and ImageNet-16H datasets, our simulation\nstudy indicates that our proposed greedy algorithm achieves near-optimal\nsubsets, resulting in improved classification performance among multiple\nexperts."}

In recent years, numerous frameworks have been\nproposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer\nspecific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these\nlimits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote\nReinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents\nexchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two\nunits: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the\nenvironment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs\nactions to maximize a reward signal.

We identify three unique\nethical dimensions of speech technologies that differentiate ASR bias from\nother algorithmic fairness concerns: the temporal burden placed on speakers of\nnon-standard varieties (\"temporal taxation\"), the disruption of conversational\nflow when systems misrecognize speech, and the fundamental connection between\nspeech patterns and personal/cultural identity. These factors create asymmetric\npower relationships that existing technical fairness metrics fail to capture.\nThe paper analyzes the tension between linguistic standardization and pluralism\nin ASR development, arguing that current approaches often embed and reinforce\nproblematic language ideologies. We conclude that addressing ASR bias requires\nmore than technical interventions; it demands recognition of diverse speech\nvarieties as legitimate forms of expression worthy of technological\naccommodation. This philosophical reframing offers new pathways for developing\nASR systems that respect linguistic diversity and speaker autonomy."}

In this work, we proposed Large Language Model-based\nagents for automated confounder discovery and subgroup analysis that integrate\nagents into the causal ML pipeline to simulate domain expertise. Our framework\nsystematically performs subgroup identification and confounding structure\ndiscovery by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents, which\nreduces human dependency while preserving interpretability. Experiments on\nreal-world medical datasets show that our proposed approach enhances treatment\neffect estimation robustness by narrowing confidence intervals and uncovering\nunrecognized confounding biases.

Model-driven TSE relies\non macroscopic traffic flow models originated from hydrodynamics. Data-driven\nTSE leverages historical sensing data and employs statistical models or machine\nlearning methods to infer traffic state. Model-data dual-driven traffic state\nestimation attempts to harness the strengths of both aspects to achieve more\naccurate TSE. From the perspective of mathematical operator theory, TSE can be\nviewed as a type of operator that maps available measurements of inerested\ntraffic state into unmeasured traffic state variables in real time. For the\nfirst time this paper proposes to study real-time freeway TSE in the idea of\nphysics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet), which is an\noperator-oriented architecture embedding traffic flow models based on deep\nneural networks. The paper has developed an extended architecture from the\noriginal PI-DeepONet. The extended architecture is featured with: (1) the\nacceptance of 2-D data input so as to support CNN-based computations; (2) the\nintroduction of a nonlinear expansion layer, an attention mechanism, and a MIMO\nmechanism; (3) dedicated neural network design for adaptive identification of\ntraffic flow model parameters. A traffic state estimator built on the basis of\nthis extended PI-DeepONet architecture was evaluated with respect to a short\nfreeway stretch of NGSIM and a large-scale urban expressway in China, along\nwith other four baseline TSE methods.

With this operation,\nrecommenders can access and learn the additional world knowledge and reasoning\ninformation via LLMs. However, in general, for different users and items, the\nworld knowledge derived from LLMs suffers from issues of hallucination, content\nredundant, and information homogenization. Directly feeding the generated\nresponse embeddings into the recommendation model can lead to unavoidable\nperformance deterioration. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge\nSelection \\& Exploitation Recommendation (KSER) framework, which effectively\nselect and extracts the high-quality knowledge from LLMs. The framework\nconsists of two key components: a knowledge filtering module and a embedding\nspaces alignment module. In the knowledge filtering module, a Embedding\nSelection Filter Network (ESFNet) is designed to assign adaptive weights to\ndifferent knowledge chunks in different knowledge fields. In the space\nalignment module, an attention-based architecture is proposed to align the\nsemantic embeddings from LLMs with the feature space used to train the\nrecommendation models.

Experimental results\nvalidate the necessity and effectiveness of both the knowledge filtering and\nalignment modules, and further demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of\nthe extractor-only training strategy."}

This thesis investigates how\nuncertainty estimation can enhance the safety and trustworthiness of ML,\nfocusing on selective prediction -- where models abstain when confidence is\nlow.\n  We first show that a model's training trajectory contains rich uncertainty\nsignals that can be exploited without altering its architecture or loss. By\nensembling predictions from intermediate checkpoints, we propose a lightweight,\npost-hoc abstention method that works across tasks, avoids the cost of deep\nensembles, and achieves state-of-the-art selective prediction performance.\nCrucially, this approach is fully compatible with differential privacy (DP),\nallowing us to study how privacy noise affects uncertainty quality. We find\nthat while many methods degrade under DP, our trajectory-based approach remains\nrobust, and we introduce a framework for isolating the privacy-uncertainty\ntrade-off. Next, we then develop a finite-sample decomposition of the selective\nclassification gap -- the deviation from the oracle accuracy-coverage curve --\nidentifying five interpretable error sources and clarifying which interventions\ncan close the gap. This explains why calibration alone cannot fix ranking\nerrors, motivating methods that improve uncertainty ordering. Finally, we show\nthat uncertainty signals can be adversarially manipulated to hide errors or\ndeny service while maintaining high accuracy, and we design defenses combining\ncalibration audits with verifiable inference.\n  Together, these contributions advance reliable ML by improving, evaluating,\nand safeguarding uncertainty estimation, enabling models that not only make\naccurate predictions -- but also know when to say \"I do not know\"."}

This work investigates how transformers learn to\nsolve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought\nprocesses, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks:\na backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to\nthe root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements\ntwo-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then\nreversing it to produce the root-to-goal path.

In this paper,\nwe introduce WeChat-YATT (Yet Another Transformer Trainer in WeChat), a simple,\nscalable, and balanced RLHF training framework specifically designed to address\nthese challenges. WeChat-YATT features a parallel controller programming model\nthat enables flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows,\neffectively mitigating the bottlenecks associated with centralized controller\narchitectures and facilitating scalability in large-scale data scenarios. In\naddition, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions\ncomputational resources and schedules workloads, thereby significantly reducing\nhardware idle time and improving GPU utilization under variable training\nconditions. We evaluate WeChat-YATT across a range of experimental scenarios,\ndemonstrating that it achieves substantial improvements in throughput compared\nto state-of-the-art RLHF training frameworks. Furthermore, WeChat-YATT has been\nsuccessfully deployed to train models supporting WeChat product features for a\nlarge-scale user base, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in\nreal-world applications."}

A key challenge underlying this limitation is the\nmodality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in\nspeech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by\nexploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization.\nTo mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization\n(OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport\nproblem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each\ntraining iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between\nspeech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,\nthen incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to\noptimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with\ntranscript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or\nlearnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training\nprocedures.

To enforce\nnorms of academic integrity and ensure students' learning, learning analytics\nmethods to automatically detect LLM-generated text appear increasingly\nappealing. This paper benchmarks the performance of different state-of-the-art\ndetectors in educational contexts, introducing a novel dataset, called\nGenerative Essay Detection in Education (GEDE), containing over 900\nstudent-written essays and over 12,500 LLM-generated essays from various\ndomains. To capture the diversity of LLM usage practices in generating text, we\npropose the concept of contribution levels, representing students' contribution\nto a given assignment. These levels range from purely human-written texts, to\nslightly LLM-improved versions, to fully LLM-generated texts, and finally to\nactive attacks on the detector by \"humanizing\" generated texts. We show that\nmost detectors struggle to accurately classify texts of intermediate student\ncontribution levels, like LLM-improved human-written texts. Detectors are\nparticularly likely to produce false positives, which is problematic in\neducational settings where false suspicions can severely impact students'\nlives.

However, understandings of the underlying mechanisms by which\nthey acquire these abilities through training remain limited, particularly from\na theoretical standpoint. This work investigates how transformers learn to\nsolve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought\nprocesses, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks:\na backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to\nthe root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements\ntwo-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then\nreversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis,\ngrounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer\ntransformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to\nunseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward\nreasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and\ncoordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive\npath. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained\ntransformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures. Moreover, they\noffer insights into the emergence of reasoning abilities, suggesting that when\ntasks are structured to take intermediate chain-of-thought steps, even shallow\nmulti-head transformers can effectively solve problems that would otherwise\nrequire deeper architectures."}

In the medical domain, decision-making often requires\nintegrating heterogeneous information sources, including patient narratives,\nstructured data, and medical images. This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist\nmultimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates\nits zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based\nquestion answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified\nprotocol. We benchmark GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-4o-2024-11-20\nagainst standardized splits of MedQA, MedXpertQA (text and multimodal), MMLU\nmedical subsets, USMLE self-assessment exams, and VQA-RAD. Results show that\nGPT-5 consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art\naccuracy across all QA benchmarks and delivering substantial gains in\nmultimodal reasoning. On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and\nunderstanding scores by +29.62% and +36.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and\nsurpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in\nunderstanding. In contrast, GPT-4o remains below human expert performance in\nmost dimensions. A representative case study demonstrates GPT-5's ability to\nintegrate visual and textual cues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain,\nrecommending appropriate high-stakes interventions. Our results show that, on\nthese controlled multimodal reasoning benchmarks, GPT-5 moves from\nhuman-comparable to above human-expert performance.
