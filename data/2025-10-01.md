<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要对分布式收发器进行时钟同步，以支持联合传输和接收技术。

Method: 提出一种频率跳变的双音波形，使收发器无需事先了解精确频率即可提取参考信号。

Conclusion: 所提出的频率跳变的双音波形能够实现分布式无线时钟同步，并且对干扰具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Distributed wireless clock synchronization is essential for aligning the
clocks of distributed transceivers in support of joint transmission and
reception techniques. One recently explored method involves synchronizing
distributed transceivers using a two-tone waveform, where the tones are
separated in frequency by a clock (frequency) reference signal. Prior research
has demonstrated frequency accuracy better than 1 Hz; however, this approach
remains vulnerable to both intentional and unintentional interference. In this
demonstration, we present a robust, frequency-hopped two-tone waveform that
enables transceivers to extract the reference signal without prior knowledge of
the exact frequency at which the tones are transmitted.

Abstract: This paper develops a graph-based hybrid beamforming framework for
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cell-free integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) networks. Specifically, we construct a novel MIMO
cell-free ISAC network model. In this model, multiple dual-function base
station (BS) transmitters employ distributed hybrid beamforming to enable
simultaneous communication and sensing, while maintaining physical separation
between the transmitters and the radar receiver. Building on this model, we
formulate a multi-objective optimization problem under a power constraint to
jointly improve communication and sensing performance. To solve it, the problem
is first reformulated as a single-objective optimization problem. Then, a
graph-based method composed of multiple graph neural networks (GNNs) is
developed to realize hybrid beamforming with either perfect or imperfect
channel state information. Once trained, the neural network model can be
deployed distributively across BSs, enabling fast and efficient inference. To
further reduce inference latency, a custom field-programmable gate array
(FPGA)-based accelerator is developed. Numerical simulations validate the
communication and sensing capabilities of the proposed optimization approach,
while experimental evaluations demonstrate remarkable performance gains of
FPGA-based acceleration in GNN inference.

*Duc Tung Bui,Le-Nam Tran*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 我们提出了一个用于 5G 开放无线接入网 (Open RAN) 下行的闭环 2x4 MIMO 实现，该实现能够传输两个传输层，并能提升数据速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: We present the first-of-a-kind closed-loop $2\times4$ MIMO implementation for
the downlink of 5G Open RAN using OpenAirInterface (OAI), which is capable of
transmitting up to two transmission layers. Our implementation is a fully
functional 5G New Radio (5G NR) system, including the 5G Core Network (5G CN),
5G Radio Access Network (5G RAN), as well as 5G NR User Equipment (UEs). This
serves as a foundational framework for further advancements in the context of
emerging Open RAN (O-RAN) development. A key feature of our implementation is
the enhanced Channel State Information (CSI) reporting procedure at the UE,
which includes Rank Indicator (RI), Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI), and
Channel Quality Indicator (CQI). It is adjusted for the extended configuration
to maximize data rates. To demonstrate the performance of our implementation,
we measure the downlink data rates using $\textit{iperf3}$ in two scenarios:
(i) fixed channels to assess two-layer data transmission and (ii)
$\textit{Rice1}$ channels for general transmission analysis. The obtained
simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the existing $2\times2$ MIMO
configuration in the OAI, our implementation improves the data rates in almost
all scenarios, especially at the high Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs).

*Duc Tung Bui,Le-Nam Tran*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: OAI平台上的5G O-RAN中实现了MU-MIMO功能，通过联合使用CU和DU，并基于CSI反馈进行用户调度，显著提升了下行吞吐量，同时保持了BLER在要求范围内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在5G O-RAN中实现并验证多用户MIMO（MU-MIMO）传输方案在物理下行共享信道（PDSCH）上的性能。

Method: 在OpenAirInterface（OAI）平台上实现了完整的O-RAN合规5G NR系统，包括5G核心网、CU/DU分离的5G RAN和5G NR用户设备（UE）。用户调度基于UE报告的PMI（CSI报告程序的一部分），并使用iperf评估系统吞吐量。

Abstract: We present the first implementation of a Multi-User Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) transmission scheme on the Physical Downlink Shared
Channel (PDSCH) for 5G Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) based on
OpenAirInterface (OAI). Our implementation features a fully functional
O-RAN-compliant 5G New Radio (5G NR) system, including a 5G Core Network (5G
CN), a refined 5G RAN, which is split into a Centre Unit (CU) and an
Distributed Unit (DU), and 5G NR User Equipment (UEs). This implementation
demonstrates MU-MIMO performance in the downlink while showcasing the
disaggregation capabilities of O-RAN. Specifically, the Base Station (i.e. gNB)
in our setup is capable of serving two UEs simultaneously over the same
downlink Resource Block (RBs). User scheduling is performed based on the
Precoding Matrix Indicators (PMIs) reported by the UEs according to the NR
Channel State Information (CSI) reporting procedure. The system throughput
performance is evaluated using $\textit{iperf}$. The obtained results via
simulation and testbed experiments demonstrate that the MU-MIMO scheme achieves
significant downlink throughput gains, particularly in the high
Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) regime, while keeping the Block Error Rate (BLER)
below the required threshold of $10^{-1}$ for both UEs.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 在FR3频段，通过MIMO-OFDM波形，利用单一基站和多个接收端为基础的分布式综合传感与通信（DISAC）系统，实现车辆用户设备（UE）的联合定位和目标定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在FR3频段，利用大型阵列和带宽，通过分布式综合传感与通信（DISAC）节点，增强定位和传感性能，尤其是在基站作为发射端，多个车辆用户设备（UE）作为接收端的场景下，实现UE的位置和目标定位。

Method: 提出一种UE端信号处理链设计，包括多径估计、杂波去除、聚类与关联方案，以及最终的联合估计器。该估计器通过加权最小二乘（WLS）问题来联合计算时钟偏移、UE位置和目标位置，并采用MIMO-OFDM波形，考虑了节点间定时偏移、扩展目标、密集多径和真实的均匀平面阵列（UPA）。

Conclusion: 所提出的UE端信号处理链设计能够有效地联合进行UE定位和目标定位，在FR3频段的DISAC系统中取得了良好的定位精度。

Abstract: Networks exploiting distributed integrated sensing and communication (DISAC)
nodes can provide enhanced localization and sensing performance, further
emphasized when operating with large arrays and bandwidths available in the
upper mid-band (also known as FR3). In this paper, we consider a DISAC system
operating at FR3 where a single base station (BS) acts as the transmitter and
several vehicular user equipments (UEs) act as the receivers. We tackle the
design of the signal processing chain at the UE side to enable joint UE
positioning and target localization. The system model exploits a
multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(MIMO-OFDM) waveform, and incorporates practical effects such as inter-node
timing offsets (TOs), extended targets, dense multipath, and realistic uniform
planar arrays (UPAs) at both ends. The proposed design includes a multipath
estimation stage at each UE, clutter removal, a novel clustering and
association scheme, and a final joint estimator of UE positions and target
locations. The estimator solves a weighted least squares (WLS) problem to
jointly compute clock offsets and localize UEs and targets. Numerical results
considering two UEs and two targets show that for 80\% of the cases the target
localization error is below 32cm, while the UE positioning error is below 44cm.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的旋转天线（RA）辅助认知无线电（CR）系统，以实现有效的频谱共享并减少干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RA技术可以通过调整天线的三维指向来利用额外的空间自由度（DoFs），从而在无线系统中获得广泛关注。本研究旨在设计一种RA辅助CR系统，以实现高效的频谱共享并减少主要和次要通信链路之间的干扰。

Method: 提出了一种优化问题，用于联合设计次级发射机（ST）处RA的传输波束成形和指向，以最大化次级接收机（SR）处的接收信噪比（SINR），同时满足主要接收机（PR）处的干扰约束和ST处最大传输功率约束。通过利用交替优化（AO）和连续凸近似（SCA）技术来解决该非凸问题。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提出的RA辅助系统在频谱共享CR系统中明显优于传统的基准方案。

Conclusion: RA技术能够同时提高SR的通信质量并减少PR的干扰，证明了其在频谱共享CR系统中的有效性。

Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) technology has recently drawn significant attention in
wireless systems owing to its unique ability to exploit additional spatial
degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) by dynamically adjusting the three-dimensional (3D)
boresight direction of each antenna. In this letter, we propose a new
RA-assisted cognitive radio (CR) system designed to achieve efficient spectrum
sharing while mitigating interference between primary and secondary
communication links. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem for the
joint design of the transmit beamforming and the boresight directions of RAs at
the secondary transmitter (ST), aimed at maximizing the received
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the secondary receiver (SR),
while satisfying both interference constraint at the primary receiver (PR) and
the maximum transmit power constraint at the ST. Although the formulated
problem is challenging to solve due to its non-convexity and coupled variables,
we develop an efficient algorithm by leveraging alternating optimization (AO)
and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to acquire high-quality
solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RA-assisted system
substantially outperforms conventional benchmark schemes in spectrum-sharing CR
systems, validating RA's capability to simultaneously enhance the communication
quality at the SR and mitigate interference at the PR.

Method: 提出了一种结合线性判别分析（LDA）和粗糙邻域集（NRS）的大数据分析方法。

Result: 在RadioML 2018数据集上验证了该方法的有效性，结果表明在特定约束下，所有调制类型可以被归类为四个不同的类别。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of electronic information technology, the number

these sources share common characteristics, which offers the potential to
effectively address the challenge of identifying unknown radiation sources.
However, research on the classification of radiation sources remains relatively
limited. This paper proposes a big data analysis method that combines linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) with a rough neighborhood set (NRS) for radiation
source classification, and its effectiveness is validated on the RadioML 2018
dataset. The results indicate that, under certain constraints, all modulation
types can be categorized into four distinct classes, laying a foundation for
further research on cognitive interference signal cancellation.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 用户设备（UE）需要支持从FR1到FR3的多个频段，但在移动性、天线视野有限、硬件和功耗限制下，多频段信道跟踪面临挑战。本文提出了一种基于Transformer的神经网络架构，用于预测多天线阵列和频段的可实现速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蜂窝无线系统需要支持从FR1到FR3的广泛频谱，尤其是在FR3频段扩展的背景下。用户设备（UE）手持设备必须在有限的尺寸内支持这些频段。然而，跨频段的信道质量快速变化、天线视野有限以及硬件和功耗限制下的测量稀疏性，给可靠的多频段信道跟踪带来了严峻挑战。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于Transformer的方法在真实世界的移动性和硬件限制下，能够更明智地进行频段选择。

Abstract: Cellular wireless systems are witnessing the proliferation of frequency bands
over a wide spectrum, particularly with the expansion of new bands in FR3.
These bands must be supported in user equipment (UE) handsets with multiple
antennas in a constrained form factor. Rapid variations in channel quality
across the bands from motion and hand blockage, limited field-of-view of
antennas, and hardware and power-constrained measurement sparsity pose
significant challenges to reliable multi-band channel tracking. This paper
formulates the problem of predicting achievable rates across multiple antenna
arrays and bands with sparse historical measurements. We propose a
transformer-based neural architecture that takes asynchronous rate histories as
input and outputs per-array rate predictions. Evaluated on ray-traced
simulations in a dense urban micro-cellular setting with FR1 and FR3 arrays,
our method demonstrates superior performance over baseline predictors, enabling
more informed band selection under realistic mobility and hardware constraints.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出利用LTE信号的多站多普勒传感系统进行无人机追踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用现有的LTE基站作为信号源，部署独立的接收器，通过测量无人机的双站多普勒频率来实现高精度轨迹追踪，无需获取基站-无人机-接收器之间的距离和角度信息。

Method: 利用LTE基站作为信号源，部署三个独立的传感接收器，接收下行信号并测量目标无人机的双站多普勒频率。通过求解最小均方误差问题，根据多普勒测量值重建无人机的初始位置和所有时间槽的速度，从而获得完整的运动轨迹。

Result: 实验证明，即使在接收器和无人机距离基站约200米的情况下，该系统也能实现高精度追踪，90%的误差小于90厘米。此精度远高于LTE信号的典型距离分辨率。

Conclusion: 多站多普勒传感系统仅通过多普勒探测即可实现高精度的无人机轨迹追踪，前提是接收器的部署密度足够高。

Abstract: In this paper, a multistatic Doppler sensing system is proposed for the drone
tracking via downlink Long-Term Evolution (LTE) signals. Specifically, the LTE
base stations (BSs) are exploited as signal illuminators, and three passive
sensing receivers are deployed at different locations to detect the bistatic
Doppler frequencies of a target drone from received downlink signals. It is
shown that even without the measurements of BS-drone-receiver range and angle,
the Doppler measurements could provide sufficient information for trajectory
tracking. Particularly, the trajectory of the target drone, consisting of the
initial position and velocities of all the time slots, can be reconstructed by
solving a minimum mean-squared error problem according to the above Doppler
measurements. It is demonstrated by experiment that although the target drone
and all the sensing receivers are around 200 meters away from the illuminating
BSs, the complicated trajectories can be tracked with 90% errors below 90
centimeters. Since this accuracy is notably higher than the typical range
resolution of LTE signals, the demonstration shows that drone trajectory
tracking with a high accuracy could be feasible solely according to Doppler
detection, as long as the deployment density of receivers is sufficiently high.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) techniques have demonstrated strong performance in
compressing and reconstructing channel state information (CSI) while reducing
feedback overhead in massive MIMO systems. A key challenge, however, is their
reliance on extensive site-specific training data, whose real-world collection
incurs significant overhead and limits scalability across deployment sites. To
address this, we propose leveraging site-specific digital twins to assist the
training of DL-based CSI compression models. The digital twin integrates an
electromagnetic (EM) 3D model of the environment, a hardware model, and ray
tracing to produce site-specific synthetic CSI data, allowing DL models to be
trained without the need for extensive real-world measurements. We further
develop a fidelity analysis framework that decomposes digital twin quality into
four key aspects: 3D geometry, material properties, ray tracing, and hardware
modeling. We explore how these factors influence the reliability of the data
and model performance. To enhance the adaptability to real-world environments,
we propose a refinement strategy that incorporates a limited amount of
real-world data to fine-tune the DL model pre-trained on the digital twin
dataset. Evaluation results show that models trained on site-specific digital
twins outperform those trained on generic datasets, with the proposed
refinement method effectively enhancing performance using limited real-world
data. The simulations also highlight the importance of digital twin fidelity,
especially in 3D geometry, ray tracing, and hardware modeling, for improving
CSI reconstruction quality. This analysis framework offers valuable insights
into the critical fidelity aspects, and facilitates more efficient digital twin
development and deployment strategies for various wireless communication tasks.

TL;DR: 高移动性场景下的延迟-多普勒（DD）域信道建模是下一代无线通信的关键，本文提出了一种基于LTE-R系统的高铁场景DD域信道测量和建模方法，并验证了OTFS系统的性能，为未来高速移动通信提供了理论指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有信道建模方法主要局限于时域、频域和空域，导致对DD域信道建模的研究不足，尤其是在高频段和高移动性场景下。而下一代无线通信系统（如6G）需要在此类场景下运行，因此，对DD域信道进行精确建模至关重要。

Method: 本文提出了一种系统性的DD域信道测量和建模方法。首先，基于LTE-R系统设计了DD域信道测量方法。然后，研究了准静态区间、多径分量的统计功率以及DD域信道衰落系数的准不变区间，用于DD域信道建模。最后，利用LTE-R系统在371 km/h的高铁场景下的测量数据，以准静态区间为判据，建立了不同信道时变条件下的DD域信道模型。

Result: 通过在371 km/h的高铁场景下进行LTE-R测量，建立了DD域信道模型，并通过OTFS传输的误比特率（BER）对比验证了模型的准确性。仿真结果表明，在高铁场景下，DD域信道衰落系数的准不变区间约为毫秒（ms）级别，远小于准静态区间的100 ms级别。

Conclusion: 本文提出的DD域信道测量和建模方法能够准确描述高铁场景下的信道特性，为高移动性环境下的DD域建模提供了理论指导，支持了未来6G及更高版本通信系统的DDMC和通信感知一体化设计。

Abstract: As next-generation wireless communication systems need to be able to operate
in high-frequency bands and high-mobility scenarios, delay-Doppler (DD) domain
multicarrier (DDMC) modulation schemes, such as orthogonal time frequency space
(OTFS), demonstrate superior reliability over orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM). Accurate DD domain channel modeling is essential for DDMC
system design. However, since traditional channel modeling approaches are
mainly confined to time, frequency, and space domains, the principles of DD
domain channel modeling remain poorly studied. To address this issue, we
propose a systematic DD domain channel measurement and modeling methodology in
high-speed railway (HSR) scenarios. First, we design a DD domain channel
measurement method based on the long-term evolution for railway (LTE-R) system.
Second, for DD domain channel modeling, we investigate quasi-stationary
interval, statistical power modeling of multipath components, and particularly,
the quasi-invariant intervals of DD domain channel fading coefficients. Third,
via LTE-R measurements at 371 km/h, taking the quasi-stationary interval as the
decision criterion, we establish DD domain channel models under different
channel time-varying conditions in HSR scenarios. Fourth, the accuracy of
proposed DD domain channel models is validated via bit error rate comparison of
OTFS transmission. In addition, simulation verifies that in HSR scenario, the
quasi-invariant interval of DD domain channel fading coefficient is on
millisecond (ms) order of magnitude, which is much smaller than the
quasi-stationary interval length on $100$ ms order of magnitude. This study
could provide theoretical guidance for DD domain modeling in high-mobility
environments, supporting future DDMC and integrated sensing and communication
designs for 6G and beyond.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于快速卷积（FC）的可变带宽（VBW）有限脉冲响应（FIR）滤波器的闭式最小二乘（LS）设计方法，该方法利用频率采样和重叠保存（OLS）方法，可显著降低实现和在线带宽重配置的复杂性，并能扩展可变带宽范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 介绍一种用于快速卷积（FC）的可变带宽（VBW）有限脉冲响应（FIR）滤波器的闭式最小二乘（LS）设计方法，旨在解决现有方法在实现和在线带宽重配置方面的复杂性问题，并寻求扩展可变带宽范围的可能性。

Method: 该方法结合了频率采样和基于重叠保存（OLS）的频域实现，利用闭式最小二乘（LS）设计。通过考虑一组相应的时不变脉冲响应来处理VBW滤波器的线性周期时变（LPTV）行为，并引入权重函数来降低最大近似误差。

Result: 数值示例表明，与现有解决方案相比，该方法在给定性能下可显著降低FC-VBW滤波器的复杂性，并能在不增加复杂性的情况下扩展可变带宽范围。此外，通过引入适当的权重函数，可以减小LPTV系统整体时不变滤波器的最大近似误差能量。

Conclusion: 所提出的闭式LS设计方法为FC-VBW滤波器提供了一种有效的、计算量大大减少的解决方案，并具有扩展可变带宽范围和优化近似误差的优点。

Abstract: This paper introduces a closed-form least-squares (LS) design approach for
fast-convolution (FC) based variable-bandwidth (VBW) finite-impulse-response
(FIR) filters. The proposed LS design utilizes frequency sampling and the VBW
filter frequency-domain implementation using the overlap-save (OLS) method,
that together offer significant savings in implementation and online bandwidth
reconfiguration complexities. Since combining frequency-domain design and OLS
implementation leads to a linear periodic time-varying (LPTV) behavior of the
VBW filter, a set of the corresponding time-invariant impulse responses is
considered in the proposed design. Through numerical examples, it is
demonstrated that the proposed approach enables not only closed-form design of
FC-based VBW filters with substantial complexity reductions compared to
existing solutions for a given performance, but also allows the variable
bandwidth range to be extended without any increase in complexity. Moreover, a
way of reducing the maximum approximation error energy over the whole set of
the time-invariant filters of the LPTV system is shown by introducing
appropriate weighting functions in the design.

Meeting these demands with current function-specific payload architectures is
challenging in terms of cost, spectral use, and sustainability. This survey
introduces the framework of multi-functional satellite systems (MFSS), which
integrate two or more of these core services into a single payload, enabling
resource sharing and functional synergy. A unified taxonomy is proposed,
covering joint communications and sensing (JCAS), joint communications and PNT
(JCAP), joint sensing and PNT (JSAP), and fully integrated joint
communications, sensing, and PNT (JCSAP) systems. The paper reviews the
state-of-the-art in each domain, examines existing payload architectures, and
outlines cooperative, integrated, and joint design strategies. Key challenges,
including waveform co-design, synchronization, interference mitigation, and
resource management, are discussed, along with potential solutions and future
research directions. By unifying diverse satellite capabilities within a single
platform, MFSS can achieve higher spectral efficiency, reduced launch mass and
cost, improved energy use, and enhanced service versatility, contributing to
the development of sustainable and intelligent non-terrestrial networks (NTNs)
for the 6G and beyond space era.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的状态空间结构，无需目标状态空间模型，并将输入层激活和网络权重视为在线估计的潜在状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的状态估计算法依赖于预定义的目标状态空间模型，这使得模型推导复杂化，并且在系统动力学发生变化时限制了适应性。基于神经网络的估计器提供了数据驱动的替代方案，但很少将经典估计理论融入其结构，并且需要大型、预先计算的训练集。

Conclusion: 所提出的统一状态空间结构提供了一种无需目标状态空间模型即可进行状态估计的有效方法，并且在准确性和适应性方面优于传统方法。

Abstract: Classical state estimation algorithms rely on predefined target's state-space
model, which complicates model derivation and limits adaptability when system
dynamics change. Neural network based estimators offer a data-driven
alternative, but rarely fuse classical estimation theory into their structure
and demand large, pre-computed training sets. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a unified state-space structure without target's state-space model and
treats both the input-layer activations and all network weights as latent
states to be estimated online. We instantiate this nonlinear model with three
canonical estimators-the extended Kalman estimator, the unscented Kalman
estimator, and the particle estimator to simulate different neural network and
demonstrate its generality. We then benchmark our approach against seven
leading neural network estimators across three representative scenarios.
Results show that our neural network state-space estimators not only retain the
robust learning capability, but also match or exceed the accuracy of both
classical and pre-trained neural network methods. Code, data, and more result:

TL;DR: 本地ASF校正能显著提升eLoran定位性能，而广域校正效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估空间ASF校正方法在韩国eLoran系统中的有效性。

Method: 在相同的模拟设置下，评估了三种校正情景：无校正（S0）、使用真实ASF值的本地校正（S1）和使用单一参考站值的广域校正（S2）。

Result: S1持续实现最低定位误差，S0误差最大且存在大片高误差区域。S2在参考站附近效果有限，且随距离和ASF空间梯度增加而恶化。

Conclusion: 本地ASF校正显著提高了eLoran的定位性能，而广域校正仅在局部区域有益。

Abstract: This paper analyzes the effectiveness of spatial ASF correction methods in
the Korean eLoran system using measured ASF maps. Three correction scenarios
were evaluated under identical simulation settings: no correction (S0), local
correction using true ASF values (S1), and wide-area correction using a single
reference station value (S2). Simulation results show that S1 consistently
achieved the lowest positioning errors, while S0 exhibited the largest errors
with extensive high-error regions. S2 provided limited improvements near the
reference station but degraded with increasing distance and ASF spatial
gradients. The findings highlight that local ASF correction significantly
improves eLoran positioning performance, whereas wide-area correction has only
localized benefits.

Result: eLoran 信号的传播延迟会受到气象因素的影响。

Conclusion: eLoran 信号的传播延迟受气象因素影响，需要进一步研究以应对 GNSS 信号丢失的场景。

Abstract: Unlike GNSS, which is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing due to its
inherently weak received power, eLoran exhibits robustness owing to its high
field strength. Therefore, the eLoran system can maintain reliable operation
even in scenarios where GNSS becomes unavailable. However, since eLoran signals
propagate through ground waves, the propagation delay is susceptible to changes
in surface conditions, including both terrain and meteorological variations.
This study aims to analyze the correlation between the temporal variations in
eLoran signal propagation delay and meteorological factors at various points
along the signal path.

Abstract: Effective communication for emergency vehicles - such as ambulances and fire
trucks - is essential to support their operations in various traffic and
environmental conditions. In this context, this paper investigates a vehicular
communication system assisted by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), which
adjusts its trajectory and resource allocation according to communication
needs. The system classifies vehicles into two groups to address their varying
service requirements: emergency vehicles, which require a minimum instantaneous
data rate to access critical information timely, and normal vehicles. To
support both categories effectively, this paper proposes a joint optimization
approach that coordinates UAV trajectory planning and Dynamic Bandwidth
Allocation (DBA). The objective is to maximize the minimum average data rate
for normal vehicles while ensuring that emergency vehicles maintain an
instantaneous rate above a predefined threshold. This approach takes into
account some system constraints, including UAV propulsion power consumption,
mobility limitations, and backhaul capacity. To tackle the resulting non-convex
problem, an iterative optimization method is employed, where the original
problem is decomposed into two subproblems: bandwidth allocation and UAV
trajectory design. In each iteration, the trajectory subproblem is solved using
the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) method. Numerical results confirm
that the proposed solution achieves superior performance in meeting service
requirements compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a secure integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)
framework for multi-user systems with multiple communication users (CUs) and
adversarial targets, where the design problem is formulated to maximize secrecy
rate under joint sensing and communication constraints. An efficient solution
is presented based on an accelerated fractional programming method using a
non-homogeneous complex quadratic transform (QT), which decomposes the problem
into tractable subproblems for beamforming and artificial noise (AN)
optimization. Unlike conventional artificial noise strategies, the proposed
approach also exploits AN to enhance sensing while avoiding interference with
legitimate users. Simulation results show significant gains in secrecy rate,
communication reliability, and sensing accuracy, confirming the effectiveness
and scalability of the proposed framework.

Motivation: 现有的RSS生成方法要么依赖于已知的参考点（RP），要么依赖于预定义的先验知识，而FinGAN通过最大化生成RSS数据与RP之间的互信息来学习RP和RSS值之间的潜在信息，从而实现从RP到RSS的端到端生成。

Method: FinGAN通过最大化生成RSS数据与RP之间的互信息来学习RP和RSS值之间的潜在信息，从而实现从RP到RSS的端到端生成，可以直接从RP生成RSS数据。

Result: FinGAN生成的合成RSS数据在定量和定性评估中都与真实RSS样本非常吻合，并且在定位性能上与完整的真实数据集相当。在公开数据集上的实验也证明了FinGAN在不同办公环境中的一致性能。

Conclusion: FinGAN能够准确地生成以前未测量过的RP的RSS数据，并且在各种场景下都具有良好的泛化能力和一致的性能。

Abstract: This work introduces FinGAN, a robust received signal strength (RSS) data
generator designed to expand RSS fingerprint datasets. Compared to existing
generative adversarial models that either rely on known reference positions
(RPs) or depend on predefined priors, FinGAN learns the latent information
between RPs and RSS values by maximizing the mutual information between the
generated RSS data and the RPs, enabling an end-to-end RSS generation directly
from RPs. This allows us to accurately generate RSS data for previously
unmeasured RPs. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that
FinGAN produces synthetic RSS data closely aligned with real RSS sample
collected from the on-site experiment, preserving localization performance
comparable to that achieved with complete real-world datasets. To further
validate its generalizability, FinGAN is also trained and evaluated on
open-source datasets from three typical office environments,and the results
demonstrate consistent performance across different scenarios.

Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing weighted sum rate in a multiple-input
single-output (MISO) downlink wireless network with emphasis on user rate
reliability. We introduce a novel risk-aggregated formulation of the complex
WSR maximization problem, which utilizes the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)
as a functional for enforcing rate (ultra)-reliability over channel fading
uncertainty/risk. We establish a WMMSE-like equivalence between the proposed
precoding problem and a weighted risk-averse MSE problem, enabling us to design
a tailored unfolded graph neural network (GNN) policy function approximation
(PFA), named {\alpha}-Robust Graph Neural Network ({\alpha}RGNN), trained to
maximize lower-tail (CVaR) rates resulting from adverse wireless channel
realizations (e.g., deep fading, attenuation). We empirically demonstrate that
a trained {\alpha}RGNN fully eliminates per user deep rate fades, and
substantially and optimally reduces statistical user rate variability while
retaining adequate ergodic performance.

Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RIS) have emerged as
a promising technology for 6G wireless networks, offering more advanced control
over electromagnetic wave propagation than conventional diagonal RIS. This
paper proposes a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework
that incorporates BD-RIS at the transmitter. This not only opens the door to
enhanced sensing and communication performance, but also alleviates the need
for large-scale fully digital radio frequency (RF) chains at the transmitter.
Based on the proposed system model, we formulate a normalized weighted
optimization problem to jointly design the active beamforming and the BD-RIS
scattering matrix with the aim of jointly minimizing the trace of the
Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for sensing targets and maximizing the sum rate (SR)
for communication users. To address this highly coupled optimization problem,
we propose a novel and low-complexity iterative algorithm that efficiently
solves the active beamforming and scattering matrix subproblems by transforming
each into a series of tractable projection problems with closed-form solutions.
Numerical results show the appealing capability of the transmitter-side
BD-RIS-aided ISAC over conventional diagonal RIS-aided ISAC in enhancing both
sensing and communication performance. Moreover, compared to the classic
iterative algorithm, the proposed algorithm offers enhanced dual-functional
performance while significantly reducing the computational complexity.

Conclusion: 本研究提出的框架显著提高了震后损伤评估的能力。

Abstract: Efficient and intelligent assessment of post-earthquake structural damage is
critical for rapid disaster response. While data-driven approaches have shown
promise, traditional supervised learning methods rely on extensive labeled
datasets, which are often impractical to obtain for damaged structures. To
address this limitation, we propose a physics-informed multi-source domain
adaptation framework to predict post-earthquake structural damage for a target
building without requiring damage labels. The multi-source domain integrates
actual damage data and numerical modeling data from buildings similar to the
target structure. The framework operates through three key steps. First, the
similarity of key physics from each domain are analyzed to form a weight
matrix, which enhances domain differentiation. Second, features from the
multi-source and target domains are extracted and fed into a classifier and a
discriminator. The classifier ensures that the features are damage-sensitive
and accurately assign damage states, while the discriminator enforces that the
features remain domain-invariant. Finally, the key parameters matrix is applied
as weights during adversarial training to optimize the contribution of features
from each source domain. The proposed framework provides a robust solution for
assessing structural damage in scenarios where labeled data is scarce,
significantly advancing the capabilities of post-earthquake damage evaluation.

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: The desirability of the mid-band frequency range (1 - 10 GHz) for federal and
commercial applications, combined with the growing applications for commercial
indoor use-cases, such as factory automation, opens up a new approach to
spectrum sharing: the same frequency bands used outdoors by federal incumbents
can be reused by commercial indoor users. A recent example of such sharing,
between commercial systems, is the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) where
unlicensed, low-power-indoor (LPI) users share the band with outdoor
incumbents, primarily fixed microwave links. However, to date, there exist no
reliable, automatic means of determining whether a device is indoors or
outdoors, necessitating the use of other mechanisms such as mandating indoor
access points (APs) to have integrated antennas and not be battery powered, and
reducing transmit power of client devices which may be outdoors. An accurate
indoor/outdoor (I/O) classification addresses these challenges, enabling
automatic transmit power adjustments without interfering with incumbents. To
this end, we leverage the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals for
I/O classification. GNSS signals, designed inherently for outdoor reception and
highly susceptible to indoor attenuation and blocking, provide a robust and
distinguishing feature for environmental sensing. We develop various
methodologies, including threshold-based techniques and machine learning
approaches and evaluate them using an expanded dataset gathered from diverse
geographical locations. Our results demonstrate that GNSS-based methods alone
can achieve greater accuracy than approaches relying solely on wireless (Wi-Fi)
data, particularly in unfamiliar locations. Furthermore, the integration of
GNSS data with Wi-Fi information leads to improved classification accuracy,
showcasing the significant benefits of multi-modal data fusion.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of higher-order modulation formats on the sensing
performance of single-carrier joint communication and sensing (JCAS) systems.
Several separate components such as a beamformer, a modulator, a target
detector, an angle of arrival (AoA) estimator and a communication demapper are
implemented as trainable neural networks (NNs). We compare geometrically shaped
modulation formats to a classical quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) scheme.
We assess the influence of multi-snapshot sensing and varying signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) on the overall performance of the autoencoder-based system. To
improve the training behavior of the system, we decouple the loss functions
from the respective SNR values and the number of sensing snapshots, using upper
bounds of the sensing and communication performance, namely the Cram\'er-Rao
bound for AoA estimation and the mutual information for communication. The
NN-based sensing outperforms classical algorithms, such as a Neyman-Pearson
based power detector for object detection and ESPRIT for AoA estimation for
both the trained constellations and QAM at low SNRs. We show that the gap in
sensing performance between classical and shaped modulation formats can be
significantly reduced through multi-snapshot sensing. Lastly, we demonstrate
system extension to multi-user multiple-input multiple-output to address the
improvement of spatial efficiency when servicing multiple user equipments. Our
contribution emphasizes the importance of estimation bounds for training neural
networks, especially when the trained solutions are deployed in varying SNR
conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for enhancing physical-layer security
in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems by leveraging the
reconfigurability of fluid antenna systems (FAS). We propose a joint precoding
and port selection (JPPS) strategy that maximizes the sum secrecy rate while
simultaneously ensuring reliable radar sensing. The problem is formulated using
fractional programming (FP) and solved through an iterative algorithm that
integrates FP transformations with successive convex approximation (SCA). To
reduce computational complexity, we further develop low-complexity schemes
based on zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, combined with greedy port selection and
trace-inverse minimization. Simulation results demonstrate substantial
improvements in both secrecy performance and sensing accuracy compared to
conventional baselines, across a wide range of FAS ports, user loads, and
sensing targets. These findings highlight the critical importance of FAS
geometry optimization in enabling secure and efficient joint
communication-sensing for next-generation wireless networks.

Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) radar systems, owing to their large bandwidth,
provide fine range resolution that enables the observation of multiple
scatterers originating from a single automotive target commonly referred to as
an extended target. Conventional CFAR-based detection algorithms typically
treat these scatterers as independent detections, thereby discarding the
spatial scattering structure intrinsic to the target. To preserve this
scattering spread, this paper proposes a Range-Doppler (RD) segment framework
designed to encapsulate the typical scattering profile of an automobile. The
statistical characterization of the segment is performed using Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and posterior density modeling facilitated through
Gibbs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. A skewness-based test
statistic, derived from the estimated statistical model, is introduced for
binary hypothesis classification of extended targets. Additionally, the paper
presents a detection pipeline that incorporates Intersection over Union (IoU)
and segment centering based on peak response, optimized to work within a single
dwell. Extensive evaluations using both simulated and real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, underscoring its
suitability for automotive radar applications through improved detection
accuracy.
