Existing approaches often\ndepend on limited labeled datasets, which restricts their ability to generalize\nto rare or unseen disturbances. This paper proposes a novel framework that\nintegrates generative modeling, sliding-window temporal processing, and\ndecision fusion to achieve robust event detection and classification using\nsynchrophasor data. A variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network is\nemployed to model normal operating conditions, where both reconstruction error\nand discriminator error are extracted as anomaly indicators. Two complementary\ndecision strategies are developed: a threshold-based rule for computational\nefficiency and a convex hull-based method for robustness under complex error\ndistributions. These features are organized into spatiotemporal detection and\nclassification matrices through a sliding-window mechanism, and an\nidentification and decision fusion stage integrates the outputs across PMUs.\nThis design enables the framework to identify known events while systematically\nclassifying previously unseen disturbances into a new category, addressing a\nkey limitation of supervised classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art accuracy, surpassing machine learning, deep learning, and\nenvelope-based baselines. The ability to recognize unknown events further\nhighlights the adaptability and practical value of the proposed approach for\nwide-area event analysis in modern power systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u878d\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u540c\u6b65\u76f8\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6b63\u5e38\u8fd0\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5224\u522b\u5668\u8bef\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u5df2\u77e5\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e76\u5c06\u672a\u77e5\u5e72\u6270\u5f52\u7c7b\u4e3a\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7f55\u89c1\u6216\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u6b63\u5e38\u8fd0\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u5224\u522b\u5668\u8bef\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u6307\u6807\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u65f6\u7a7a\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u51f8\u5305\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8de8PMU\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5305\u7edc\u7ebf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u5df2\u77e5\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u672a\u77e5\u5e72\u6270\u5f52\u7c7b\u4e3a\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u5904\u7406\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u672a\u77e5\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fd0\u884c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

See\n  https://icat.etf.unsa.ba/2025/", "summary": "Wi-Fi-based positioning promises a scalable and privacy-preserving solution\nfor location-based services in indoor environments such as malls, airports, and\ncampuses. RSS-based methods are widely deployable as RSS data is available on\nall Wi-Fi-capable devices, but RSS is highly sensitive to multipath, channel\nvariations, and receiver characteristics. While supervised learning methods\noffer improved robustness, they require large amounts of labeled data, which is\noften costly to obtain. We introduce a lightweight framework that solves this\nby automating high-resolution synchronized RSS-location data collection using a\nshort, camera-assisted calibration phase. An overhead camera is calibrated only\nonce with ArUco markers and then tracks a device collecting RSS data from\nbroadcast packets of nearby access points across Wi-Fi channels. The resulting\n(x, y, RSS) dataset is used to automatically train mobile-deployable\nlocalization algorithms, avoiding the privacy concerns of continuous video\nmonitoring.

Time-integrated methods, such as the generalised Lomb-Scargle\n(GLS) periodogram, provide a robust statistical assessment of persistent\nperiodicities but are insensitive to transient events. Conversely, existing\ntime-frequency methods often rely on fixed-duration windows or interpolation,\nwhich can be suboptimal for non-uniform data. We introduce the non-uniform\nStockwell-transform (NUST), a time-frequency framework that applies a localized\ndensity adaptive spectral analysis directly to non-uniformly sampled data. NUST\nemploys a doubly adaptive window that adjusts its width based on both frequency\nand local data density, providing detailed time-frequency information for both\ntransient and persistent signals. We validate the NUST on numerous\nnon-uniformly sampled synthetic signals, demonstrating its superior\ntime-localization performance compared to GLS.

The framework captures sophisticated\nfeatures such as near-field channel modeling, fully and partially connected\nantenna architectures, and users' mobility. First, we consider joint user\nassociation and hybrid beamforming optimization to maximize the system\nsum-rate, subject to power constraints, maximum cluster size of cooperating\nBSs, and users' quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. By leveraging fractional\nprogramming FP and majorization-minimization techniques, an iterative algorithm\nis proposed to solve the non-convex optimization problem. We then consider\nhandover (HO)-aware resource allocation for moving users in a cooperative\nUMB/THz MBN. Two HO-aware resource allocation methods are proposed. The first\nmethod focuses on maximizing the HO-aware system sum-rate subject to HO-aware\nQoS constraints. Using Jensen's inequality and properties of logarithmic\nfunctions, the non-convex optimization problem is tightly approximated with a\nconvex one and solved.

Sun", "Richard D. James"], "title": "Theoretical framework of passive ME antenna arrays enabling in-vivo monitoring: A pathway to smart implants", "comment": null, "summary": "A new brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, deployed through minimally\ninvasive surgery, is changing the way we think about treating severe\nneurological conditions. The central idea is to place a device called Stentrode\nin the brain's vasculature, which enables neuromodulation and helps patients\nregain the ability to communicate. However, in such devices, the battery and\nelectronics are wired and could introduce damage or implant malfunction. In\nthese cases, a Stentrode integrated with magnetoelectric (ME) antennas could be\nof great interest. ME antennas offer significant advantages over traditional\nantennas, leveraging acoustic resonance rather than electromagnetic resonance\nto achieve a size reduction of up to five orders of magnitude. In addition to\ntheir compactness and immunity to ground-plane interference, ME antennas could\nbe adopted for use in vascular implants, such as coronary stents, potentially\nenabling minimally invasive monitoring and communication. Despite these\nadvantages, a single antenna embedded in the implant may be constrained by the\nlimited volume of magnetostrictive material, which could result in low output\ngain.

In this paper, we propose a robust, flexible,\nand practically implementable framework for FRI reconstruction by introducing\nnovel learnable kernel strategies. First, we demonstrate effective\nreconstruction using known, fixed kernels such as truncated Gaussian and\nGaussian pair kernels, which mitigate the requirement that the samples should\nhave a sum-of-exponentials (SoE) form. Next, we extend this concept by jointly\noptimizing both the sampling kernel and reconstruction encoder through a\nunified learning approach, yielding adaptive kernels that significantly\noutperform traditional methods in resolution and noise robustness, with reduced\nsampling rates. Furthermore, we propose a practical hardware realization by\nrepresenting kernels as sums of two exponential decay signals with jointly\noptimized poles, facilitating compact, efficient analog implementations. Our\napproach is validated experimentally through hardware implementations using a\nunity-gain Sallen-Key analog filter, achieving accurate real-world signal\nrecovery.

To tackle this issue, this\npaper proposes an expectation propagation (EP)-based detector, termed\noverlapping block partitioning EP (OvEP). In OvEP, the large-scale measurement\nvector is partitioned into partially overlapping blocks. For each block and its\noverlapping part, a low-complexity linear minimum mean square error\n(LMMSE)-based filter is designed according to the partitioned structure. The\nresulting LMMSE outputs are then combined to generate the input to the\ndenoiser. In this combining process, subtracting the overlapping-part outputs\nfrom the block outputs effectively mitigates the adverse effects of inter-block\ncorrelation induced by high spatial correlation.

However, real-world scenarios often require identifying signals from\nnovel emitters previously unseen. Since these novel emitters only have a few or\nno prior samples, existing models struggle to identify signals from novel\nemitters online and tend to bias toward the distribution of seen emitters. To\naddress these challenges, we propose the Online Specific Emitter Identification\n(OSEI) task, comprising both online \\revise{few-shot and generalized zero-shot}\nlearning tasks. It requires constructing models using signal samples from seen\nemitters and then identifying new samples from seen and novel emitters online\nduring inference. We propose a novel hash-based model, Collision-Alleviated\nSignal Hash (CASH), providing a unified approach for addressing the OSEI task.\nThe CASH operates in two steps: in the seen emitters identifying step, a signal\nencoder and a seen emitters identifier determine whether the signal sample is\nfrom seen emitters, mitigating the model from biasing toward seen emitters\ndistribution. In the signal hash coding step, an online signal hasher assigns a\nhash code to each signal sample, identifying its specific emitter. Experimental\nresults on real-world signal datasets (i.e., ADSB and ORACLE) demonstrate that\nour method accurately identifies signals from both seen and novel emitters\nonline. This model outperforms existing methods by a minimum of 6.08\\% and\n8.55\\% in accuracy for the few-shot and \\revise{generalized zero-shot learning\n}tasks, respectively.

Petropulu", "Husheng Li"], "title": "Wideband Integrated Sensing and Communications: Spectral Efficiency and Signaling Design", "comment": null, "summary": "In integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), a distinguishing feature of\n6G wireless networks, the main challenge lies in integrating the two distinct\nfunctions of sensing and communication within the same waveform. In this paper,\nthe ISAC waveform synthesis is studied in the wideband regime, since a large\nbandwidth can simplify the analysis and is justified by the employment of\nmillimeter wave or higher frequency band. Standard orthogonal frequency\ndivision multiplexing (OFDM) signaling is assumed, and the wideband analysis of\nsensing is a counterpart of the existing studies on wideband communications. It\nis proposed that the phase over such OFDM subcarriers is for modulating\ncommunication messages while the power spectral density (PSD) is shaped for the\nsensing performance. Beyond OFDM, we further reveal a duality between the\nproposed PSD-shaping rule and the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)\nwaveform.

We leverage a Gaussian assumption to draw curves showing how moving on\na Pareto surface helps administer such a trade-off better than simply relying\non optimal rate-distortion compression and hoping that compressed signals can\nbe distinguished from each other."}

Traditional methods, such as empirical\nmodel-based optimization algorithms, are hindered by excessive measurement\nrequirements and suboptimal solutions, while machine learning (ML) approaches\noften struggle with complex tunnel environments. This paper proposes a deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) driven framework that integrates parabolic wave\nequation (PWE) channel modeling, conditional generative adversarial network\n(cGAN) based data augmentation, and a dueling deep Q network (Dueling DQN) for\nAP placement optimization. The PWE method generates high-fidelity path loss\ndistributions for a subset of AP positions, which are then expanded by the cGAN\nto create high resolution path loss maps for all candidate positions,\nsignificantly reducing simulation costs while maintaining physical accuracy. In\nthe DRL framework, the state space captures AP positions and coverage, the\naction space defines AP adjustments, and the reward function encourages signal\nimprovement while penalizing deployment costs. The dueling DQN enhances\nconvergence speed and exploration exploitation balance, increasing the\nlikelihood of reaching optimal configurations. Comparative experiments show\nthat the proposed method outperforms a conventional Hooke Jeeves optimizer and\ntraditional DQN, delivering AP configurations with higher average received\npower, better worst-case coverage, and improved computational efficiency.

We\nbenchmarked eight ECG foundation models on 26 clinically relevant tasks using\n12 public datasets comprising 1,650 regression and classification targets.\nModels were evaluated under fine-tuning and frozen settings, with scaling\nanalyses across dataset sizes. Results show heterogeneous performance across\ndomains: in the most widely studied domain, adult ECG interpretation, three\nfoundation models consistently outperformed strong supervised baselines. In\ncontrast, ECG-CPC, a compact structured state-space model pretrained on HEEDB,\ndominated other categories where most foundation models failed to surpass\nsupervised learning. Foundation models also displayed distinct scaling\nbehaviors with dataset size, which are critical for small-scale clinical\napplications. Overall, while foundation models show promise for adult ECG\nanalysis, substantial gaps remain in cardiac structure, outcome prediction, and\npatient characterization. Notably, ECG-CPC's strong performance despite being\norders of magnitude smaller and consuming minimal computational resources\nhighlights untapped opportunities for advancing ECG foundation models."}
