Developing\naccurate and reliable ML models depends on access to high-quality, annotated\ndata, a resource in short supply. ML competitions address this need by\nproviding researchers access to expertly annotated datasets, fostering shared\nlearning through direct model comparisons, and leveraging the benefits of\ncrowdsourcing diverse expertise. We compiled a retrospective dataset containing\n353 hours of EEG from 102 individual newborns from a multi-centre study. The\ndata was fully anonymised and divided into training, testing, and held-out\nvalidation datasets. EEGs were graded for the severity of abnormal background\npatterns. Next, we created a web-based competition platform and hosted a\nmachine learning competition to develop ML models for classifying the severity\nof EEG background patterns in newborns. After the competition closed, the top 4\nperforming models were evaluated offline on a separate held-out validation\ndataset. Although a feature-based model ranked first on the testing dataset,\ndeep learning models generalised better on the validation sets. All methods had\na significant decline in validation performance compared to the testing\nperformance. This highlights the challenges for model generalisation on unseen\ndata, emphasising the need for held-out validation datasets in ML studies with\nneonatal EEG. The study underscores the importance of training ML models on\nlarge and diverse datasets to ensure robust generalisation. The competition's\noutcome demonstrates the potential for open-access data and collaborative ML\ndevelopment to foster a collaborative research environment and expedite the\ndevelopment of clinical decision-support tools for neonatal neuromonitoring."}

Upon command, sensors send their\nobservations to a remote sink over error-prone channels. We assume each sensor\nexhibits state-dependent detection accuracy and may occasionally fail to detect\nthe source state. At most one sensor is scheduled for sampling at each time\nslot. We assess the effectiveness of data communication using a generic\ndistortion function that captures the end application's objective. We derive\noptimal sink-side command policies to minimize the weighted sum of distortion\nand transmission costs. To model the uncertainty introduced by sensing failures\n(of the sensors) and packet loss, we formulate the problem as a partially\nobservable Markov decision process (POMDP), which we then cast into a\nbelief-MDP. Since the belief evolves continuously, the belief space is\ndiscretized into a finite grid and the belief value is quantized to the nearest\ngrid point after each update. This formulation leads to a finite-state MDP\nproblem, which is solved using the relative value iteration algorithm (RVIA).\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed policy significantly\noutperforms benchmark strategies and highlights the importance of accounting\nfor state-dependent sensing reliability in sensor scheduling."}

Laboratory evaluation of the headband on an anthropomorphic\ntest device showed good agreement with a reference sensor for soccer ball\nimpacts to the front of the head. In this study, we evaluate the headband in\nmeasuring the full head kinematics of soccer headers in the field. Methods: The\nheadband was evaluated under typical soccer heading scenarios (throw-ins,\ngoal-kicks, and corner-kicks) on a human subject. The measured time history and\npeak kinematics from the headband were compared with those from an instrumented\nmouthpiece, which is a widely accepted method for measuring head kinematics in\nthe field. Results: The time history agreement (CORA scores) between the\nheadband and the mouthpiece ranged from 'fair' to 'excellent', with the highest\nagreement for angular velocities (0.79 \\pm 0.08) and translational\naccelerations (0.73 \\pm 0.05) and lowest for angular accelerations (0.67 \\pm\n0.06). A Bland-Altman analysis of the peak kinematics from the headband and\nmouthpiece found the mean bias to be 40.9% (of the maximum mouthpiece reading)\nfor the angular velocity, 16.6% for the translational acceleration, and-14.1%\nfor the angular acceleration.

With this in mind, the newly proposed pinching antenna systems\n(PASs) are a promising solution for indoor applications because they can\nactivate antennas across a waveguide deployed in a room, thus reducing the\ndistance between the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we investigate a\ntwo-user, two-pinching-antenna uplink PAS, in which the transmitters use rate\nsplitting to create a more resilient framework than non-orthogonal multiple\naccess (NOMA).

Fetal EEG is complex to acquire and difficult and\nlaborious to interpret consistently. However, accurate sleep stage\nclassification may aid in the early detection of abnormal brain maturation\nassociated with pregnancy complications (e.g. hypoxia or intrauterine growth\nrestriction).\n  Methods: EEG electrodes were secured onto the ovine dura over the parietal\ncortices of 24 late gestation fetal sheep. A lightweight deep neural network\noriginally developed for adult EEG sleep staging was trained on the ovine EEG\nusing transfer learning from adult EEG. A spectral equalisation-based domain\nadaptation strategy was used to reduce cross-domain mismatch.\n  Results: We demonstrated that while direct transfer performed poorly, full\nfine tuning combined with spectral equalisation achieved the best overall\nperformance (accuracy: 86.6 percent, macro F1-score: 62.5), outperforming\nbaseline models.\n  Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, FetalSleepNet is the first deep\nlearning framework specifically developed for automated sleep staging from the\nfetal EEG. Beyond the laboratory, the EEG-based sleep stage classifier\nfunctions as a label engine, enabling large scale weak/semi supervised labeling\nand distillation to facilitate training on less invasive signals that can be\nacquired in the clinic, such as Doppler Ultrasound or electrocardiogram data.\nFetalSleepNet's lightweight design makes it well suited for deployment in low\npower, real time, and wearable fetal monitoring systems."}

As a result, contactless solutions based\non radar sensing have garnered increasing attention.
