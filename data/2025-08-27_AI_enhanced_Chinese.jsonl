Our position yields three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT\ncorrelates with conventional difficulty on reasoning benchmarks, (ii)\nDoT-ordered curricula outperform length- or judge-scored curricula under\nmatched budgets, and (iii) the difficulty is robust across teacher models given\nlight formatting controls. We propose an evaluation framework and discuss\nthreats to validity (teacher style, length confounds) alongside practical\nmitigations.

In this study, we propose a\nmulti-modal machine learning framework that integrates Sentence Transformer\nembeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to predict\nthe drift of leeway objects in water. We begin by experimentally collecting\nenvironmental and physical data, including water current and wind velocities,\nobject mass, and surface area, for five distinct leeway objects. Using\nsimulated data from a Navier-Stokes-based model to train a convolutional neural\nnetwork on geometrical image representations, we estimate drag and lift\ncoefficients of the leeway objects. These coefficients are then used to derive\nthe net forces responsible for driving the objects' motion. The resulting time\nseries, comprising physical forces, environmental velocities, and\nobject-specific features, combined with textual descriptions encoded via a\nlanguage model, are inputs to attention-based sequence-to-sequence\nlong-short-term memory and Transformer models, to predict future drift\ntrajectories. We evaluate the framework across multiple time horizons ($1$,\n$3$, $5$, and $10$ seconds) and assess its generalization across different\nobjects.

Our approach\nreplaces traditional positional encodings with complex embeddings where the\nreal part captures semantic content and the imaginary part encodes positional\ninformation.

It can be viewed as partitioning a large Feed-Forward Network\n(FFN) at the tensor level into fine-grained sub-FFNs, or experts, and\nactivating only a sparse subset for each input. While this sparsity improves\nefficiency, MoE still faces substantial challenges due to their massive\ncomputational scale and unpredictable activation patterns.\n  To enable efficient MoE deployment, we identify dual sparsity at the tensor\nand neuron levels in pre-trained MoE modules as a key factor for both accuracy\nand efficiency. Unlike prior work that increases tensor-level sparsity through\nfiner-grained expert design during pre-training, we introduce post-training\nexpert partitioning to induce such sparsity without retraining.

During multi-turn interactions\nbetween agents and users, the dynamic, uncertain, and stochastic nature of user\ndemands poses significant challenges to the agent's tool invocation\ncapabilities. Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a\nresult; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs\nthrough communication while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user\nqueries.

Additionally,\nwe address the issue of vanishing gradients of GPs in high-dimensional spaces.\nWe provide a convergence analysis and demonstrate through experimental results\nthat our method enhances the efficacy of TuRBO and outperforms a wide range of\nhigh-dimensional BO techniques on synthetic functions and real-world\napplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u548cHessian\u7684\u591a\u5c40\u90e8\u4e8c\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3GP\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u548cHessian\u6784\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u4e8c\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u754c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u9009\u62e9\u91c7\u6837\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86TuRBO\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5408\u6210\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u5c40\u90e8\u4e8c\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u63a8\u5e7f\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, real-world test data often exhibit domain\nshifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the\nmodel to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the\ntraining and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world\nscenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade\nclosed-set accuracy.

However, the\neffectiveness of VQAs is often constrained by the so-called barren plateau\nproblem, wherein gradients diminish exponentially as system size or circuit\ndepth increases, thereby hindering training. In this work, we propose a\nreinforcement learning (RL)-based initialization strategy to alleviate the\nbarren plateau issue by reshaping the initial parameter landscape to avoid\nregions prone to vanishing gradients. In particular, we explore several RL\nalgorithms (Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal\nPolicy Optimization, etc.) to generate the circuit parameters (treated as\nactions) that minimize the VQAs cost function before standard gradient-based\noptimization. By pre-training with RL in this manner, subsequent optimization\nusing methods such as gradient descent or Adam proceeds from a more favorable\ninitial state. Extensive numerical experiments under various noise conditions\nand tasks consistently demonstrate that the RL-based initialization method\nsignificantly enhances both convergence speed and final solution quality.\nMoreover, comparisons among different RL algorithms highlight that multiple\napproaches can achieve comparable performance gains, underscoring the\nflexibility and robustness of our method.

We show that, on any\ndigital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no\napproximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no\nreasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons\nin the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's\ncomplexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of\nthe emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade\nalgorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of\nneurons).\n  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating\nshortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped\nTuring machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation\nof randomized Boolean circuits.

In\nthis paper, we propose EMMM, an explanation-then-detection framework that\nbalances latency, accuracy, and non-expert-oriented interpretability.\nExperimental results demonstrate that EMMM provides explanations accessible to\nnon-expert users, with 70\\% of human evaluators preferring its outputs, while\nachieving competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and\nmaintaining low latency, generating outputs within 1 second.

To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored\nreinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge\ndistillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward\nshaping.

GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code\nsimilarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen\nreal-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and\ninterpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious\ncorrelations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.\nCounterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite\nlabels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a\nLarge Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples\nwith opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the\ncrucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring\nspurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more\nrobust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to\n97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group\naccuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20\nvulnerability.

Both\nacoustic and textual emotional states are projected onto an interpretable\nthree-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space-Tension, Stability, and\nArousal. Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls (approximately 1,800 hours),\nwe construct features capturing dynamic shifts in executive affect between\nscripted presentation and spontaneous Q&A exchanges. Our key finding reveals a\npronounced divergence in predictive capacity: while multimodal features do not\nforecast directional stock returns, they explain up to 43.8% of the\nout-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility. Importantly, volatility\npredictions are strongly driven by emotional dynamics during executive\ntransitions from scripted to spontaneous speech, particularly reduced textual\nstability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and significant\narousal variability from CEOs.

Recent approaches incorporate Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce\ncomputational overhead.

We fine-tune an\nLRM using HDS-QA, naming the model HybridDeepSearcher, which outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving +15.9\nand +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and a subset of BrowseComp, respectively, both\nrequiring comprehensive and exhaustive search. Experimental results highlight\ntwo key advantages: HybridDeepSearcher reaches comparable accuracy with fewer\nsearch turns, significantly reducing inference latency, and it effectively\nscales as more turns are permitted. These results demonstrate the efficiency,\nscalability, and effectiveness of explicitly training LRMs to leverage hybrid\nparallel and sequential querying.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165HDS-QA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u56e0\u7eaf\u5e8f\u5217\u67e5\u8be2\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5229\u7528HDS-QA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u884c\u4e0e\u987a\u5e8f\u67e5\u8be2\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578bHybridDeepSearcher\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3LRMs\u5229\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u5e73\u884c\u4e0e\u987a\u5e8f\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction,\nwhich predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual\nperspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality\nconstraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has\nbeen largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based\nmodel reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two\nchallenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing\nthem can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to\npredict these critical constraints efficiently.

Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's\ndecisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as\nbeliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles\nemerges from these differences, highlighting that \"style\" is an essential but\noften overlooked dimension of intelligence.\n  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing\nand analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines\nits foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical\nperspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,\nwe construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction\nloop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On\nthis basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable\nindicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.\n  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and\nmeasuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized\nstate spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive\nbalance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement\nlearning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific\nstylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style\nlearning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential\nof these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive\nentertainment.\n  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of\nstyle as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u201c\u73a9\u6cd5\u98ce\u683c\u201d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u5206\u6790\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65b0\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5176\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u672a\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f25\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7406\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u98ce\u683c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u51b3\u7b56\u201c\u98ce\u683c\u201d\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u54f2\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u98ce\u683c\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8861\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u751f\u6210\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u4e0e\u5a31\u4e50\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u98ce\u683c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73a9\u6cd5\u98ce\u683c\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u5177\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u6210\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u3002"}}

GaaS employs declarative rules\nand a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and\nseverity-weighted violations.

In the baseline, agents act without governance; in the second,\nGaaS enforces policies; in the third, adversarial agents probe robustness. All\nactions are intercepted, evaluated, and logged for analysis. Results show that\nGaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving\nthroughput. Trust scores track rule adherence, isolating and penalizing\nuntrustworthy components in multi-agent systems.\n  By positioning governance as a runtime service akin to compute or storage,\nGaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent\necosystems.

To\nenhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration\nmethods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods.\nAdditionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that\njointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering\nperformance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level\ncompared to LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u5bf9\u5176\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u4fe1\u5fc3\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LVLMs\u867d\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u5927VQA\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u81ea\u8eab\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u6821\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83LVLMs\u4e0e\u7eaf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "LVLMs\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4fe1\u5fc3\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u6982\u7387\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6700\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u8bdd\u8bed\u4fe1\u5fc3\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4e50\u89c2\uff1b\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u4fe1\u5fc3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u5fc3\u6821\u51c6\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u5904\u7406\u4f18\u5316\uff0cLVLMs\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u5f97\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u9519\u8bef\u3002"}}

Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,\nmodel generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social\ndiscrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing\ndebiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and\nneed extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between\nmodel fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we\npropose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that\nefficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with\nmuch less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external\ndataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to\nfirst find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to\nboth bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process\nupdates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its\ncontribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes\n(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray\ndatasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while\nachieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common\nfairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art.

Motivated by the fact that users provide more reliable\nfeedback after consuming items, we propose a new bandit model that can be\ndescribed as follows. The algorithm recommends one item per time step; after\nconsuming that item, the user is asked to compare it with another item chosen\nfrom the user's consumption history. Importantly, in our model, this comparison\nitem can be chosen without incurring any additional regret, potentially leading\nto better performance.

Extensive experiments on real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that MOCHA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in event\nprediction, but also reveals meaningful and interpretable causal structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u9636\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u53d1\u73b0\u6846\u67b6MOCHA\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u9759\u6001\u6216\u4e00\u9636\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u591a\u9636\u548c\u65f6\u53d8\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff08DAG\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u5fae\u6846\u67b6\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784", "conclusion": "MOCHA\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u53d8\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c"}}

Previous research primarily focused on the linear\ncase for the dynamics function in neural ODEs - Marion, P. (2023), or provided\nbounds for Neural Controlled ODEs that depend on the sampling interval\nBleistein et al. (2023).

However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training\ndomain (\\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains\nuncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their\ntraditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in\nconjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and\ntheoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node\ngraphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat\nequation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN\nachieves a loss $\\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme\nwith an error of $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show\nthat the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of\nthe standard first-order FV scheme.

We argue\nthat MTP's exact future token prediction is too difficult as an auxiliary loss.\nInstead, we propose Token Order Prediction (TOP), which trains models to order\nupcoming tokens by their proximity using a learning-to-rank loss. TOP requires\nonly a single additional unembedding layer compared to MTP's multiple\ntransformer layers. We pretrain models of 340M, 1.8B, and 7B parameters using\nNTP, MTP, and TOP objectives. Results on eight standard NLP benchmarks show\nthat TOP overall outperforms both NTP and MTP even at scale.
