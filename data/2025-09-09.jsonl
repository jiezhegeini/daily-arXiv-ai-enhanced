To tackle the challenges in the fractional objective function, we\nbegin by applying the quadratic transformation method to simplify it into a\nmanageable form. An alternating optimization-based algorithm is then developed\nto iteratively update the BS and STAR-RIS beamforming coefficients. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs better than other\nbaseline schemes in the presence of HWIs. Moreover, the variation of the\nachievable SE-EE region with different transmit power budgets is analyzed."}

The\nfollowing paper presents an ISAC imaging framework utilizing channel state\ninformation (CSI) per-path components, transmitter (TX) positions, and receiver\n(RX) positions obtained from the calibrated NYURay ray tracer at 6.75 GHz in\nthe upper mid-band. Our work shows how each resolvable multipath component can\nbe extracted from CSI estimation and cast into an equivalent three-dimensional\nreflection point by fusing its angle and delay information, which is useful and\nchallenging for multi-bounce reflections. The primary contribution of the paper\nis the two-segment reflection point optimization algorithm, which independently\nestimates the path lengths from the TX position and RX position to an\nequivalent reflection point (ERP) on the object surface, thus enabling precise\ngeometric reconstruction. Subsequently, we aggregate the ERPs derived from\nmultiple pairs of TX and RX positions, generating dense three dimensional point\nclouds representing the objects in the channel. Experimental results validate\nthat the proposed ISAC imaging framework accurately reconstructs object\nsurfaces, edges, and curved features. To the best of our knowledge, this paper\nprovides the first demonstration of multi bounce ISAC imaging using wireless\nray tracing at 6.75 GHz."}

However, the acquisition of\ndiverse and high-fidelity radar datasets for robust algorithm development\nremains a significant challenge. To overcome this bottleneck, a model-based\nfrequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar HAR simulator is developed.\nThe simulator integrates an anthropometrically scaled $13$-scatterer kinematic\nmodel to simulate $12$ distinct activities. The FMCW radar echo model is\nemployed, which incorporates dynamic radar cross-section (RCS), free-space or\nthrough-the-wall propagation, and a calibrated noise floor to ensure signal\nfidelity. The simulated raw data is then processed through a complete pipeline,\nincluding moving target indication (MTI), bulk Doppler compensation, and\nSavitzky-Golay denoising, culminating in the generation of high-resolution\nrange-time map (RTM) and Doppler-time maps (DTMs) via both short-time Fourier\ntransform (STFT) and Fourier synchrosqueezed transform (FSST). Finally, a novel\nneural network method is proposed to validate the effectiveness of the radar\nHAR. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the simulator successfully\ngenerates high-fidelity and distinct micro-Doppler signature, which provides a\nvaluable tool for radar HAR algorithm design and validation.

Unlike deep learning (DL)\napproaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach\nalso avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more\nlightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with\nsupervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully\nCSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with\nadjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature\nselection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to\njointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed GL approach achieves competitive spectral\nefficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models, while reducing floating-point\noperations (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude. These advantages make the\nproposed GL approach highly suitable for real-time deployment in energy- and\nhardware-constrained broadcasting scenarios."}
