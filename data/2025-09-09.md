*Qiang Fu,Changhui Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 3D-FQFlow是一个开源框架，用于模拟3D血管血流和超声成像，并考虑了组织运动，解决了现有模拟工具的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的超声成像（uPDI）缺乏能够模拟现实条件下三维（3D）定量血流和组织运动的仿真工具。

Method: 开发了一个名为3D-FQFlow的开源框架，集成了血管生成器、计算流体动力学（CFD）模拟器、组织运动模拟器、超声模拟器、重建器和定量分析器。

Result: 仿真结果显示了四种运动模式对奇异值分解（SVD）的显著影响，成功实现了兔肾脏、生成的血管系统和临床肺动脉的3D成像（SSIM值分别为0.951、0.902和0.850），并且GPU加速能够在大规模仿真中实现显著的速度提升。

Conclusion: 3D-FQFlow是首个用于在现实血管和运动条件下对uPDI进行定量验证的开源框架，为微血管成像研究建立了可重复的标准。

Abstract: Ultrafast power Doppler imaging (uPDI) has made significant progress and
become an important imaging method for both research and clinical
implementations. While, it lacks simulation tools that can perform
three-dimensional (3D) quantitative flow with tissue motion close to realistic
conditions. In this study, we explore to construct an open-source framework,
named 3D-Fully Quantitative Flow (3D-FQFlow), to provide quantitative modeling
of 3D vascular flow with tissue motion and uPDI imaging. The framework
integrates a L-system-based vascular generator with SimVascular CFD for
hemodynamics, a tissue motion simulator supporting user-defined or
clinical-data-driven condition, an optimized PFILED ultrasound simulator, a
precomputed-matrix-based reconstructor, and a quantitative analyzer
(MSE/PSNR/SSIM). Results demonstrate distinct influences of four motion
patterns on SVD decomposition; successful 3D imaging of rabbit kidney (SSIM =
0.951), generated vasculature (SSIM = 0.902), and clinical pulmonary arteries
(SSIM = 0.850); and GPU acceleration permitting 1-million-scatterer simulation
in 4,117 seconds with 18.8* speedup for 100-frame 3D-uPDI generation. 3D-FQFlow
establishes the first open-source framework for quantitative validation of uPDI
under realistic vascular and motion conditions, creating a reproducible
standard for microvascular imaging research

### [2] [Time-Modulated Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces for Integrated Sensing, Communication and Security: A Generative AI Design Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05565)
*Zhihao Tao,Athina Petropulu,H. Vincent Poor*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种利用时间调制智能反射面（TM-IRS）和GFlowNet来增强集成传感与通信（ISAC）系统物理层安全的新方法，旨在同时优化通信、传感和安全性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISAC系统在存在窃听者的情况下，需要一种方法来同时保证合法用户的通信完整性并阻止窃听，同时实现有效的传感。

Method: 提出了一种基于GFlowNet的TM-IRS配置方法。GFlowNet被用作一种生成模型，通过学习一个随机策略来从大量的离散参数空间中采样高性能的TM-IRS配置。该方法将TM-IRS设计建模为一个马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），并设计了联合通信和传感性能的奖励函数来训练GFlowNets。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的GFlowNet方法能够有效地同时集成传感、通信和安全。与穷举搜索和基于规则的设计方法相比，该方法具有显著的采样效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GFlowNet是一种有效的方法，可以为ISAC系统设计TM-IRS配置，以同时实现通信、传感和安全目标，并且在采样效率和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to achieve physical layer security for integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) systems operating in the presence of targets
that may be eavesdroppers. The system is aided by a time-modulated intelligent
reflecting surface (TM-IRS), which is configured to preserve the integrity of
the transmitted data at one or more legitimate communication users (CUs) while
making them appear scrambled in all other directions. The TM-IRS design
leverages a generative flow network (GFlowNet) framework to learn a stochastic
policy that samples high-performing TM-IRS configurations from a vast discrete
parameter space. Specifically, we begin by formulating the achievable sum rate
for the legitimate CUs and the beampattern gain toward the target direction,
based on which we construct reward functions for GFlowNets that jointly capture
both communication and sensing performance. The TM-IRS design is modeled as a
deterministic Markov decision process (MDP), where each terminal state
corresponds to a complete configuration of TM-IRS parameters. GFlowNets,
parametrized by deep neural networks are employed to learn a stochastic policy
that samples TM-IRS parameter sets with probability proportional to their
associated reward. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed GFlowNet-based method in integrating sensing, communication and
security simultaneously, and also exhibit significant sampling efficiency as
compared to the exhaustive combinatorial search and enhanced robustness against
the rule-based TM-IRS design method.

### [3] [Power-Measurement-Based Channel Estimation for Beyond Diagonal RIS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05639)
*Yijie Liu,Weidong Mei,He Sun,Dong Wang,Peilan Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 利用用户端接收功率测量，通过单层神经网络实现超过对角线可重构智能表面（BD-RIS）的信道状态信息（CSI）估计，以克服传统基于导频的方法的开销和兼容性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BD-RIS信道估计方法主要依赖专用导频信号，增加了系统开销，并可能与现有通信协议不兼容。

Method: 提出一种新颖的、利用用户端易于获取的接收功率测量数据的单层神经网络（NN）驱动的信道估计方法。该方法利用接收信号功率与BD-RIS的CSI之间类似于单层神经网络的关系，通过在不同训练反射系数下收集的功率测量值，利用反向传播来恢复CSI。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提出的方法可以实现较小的归一化均方误差（NMSE），特别是在训练反射次数较多的情况下。

Conclusion: 所提出的单层神经网络方法利用接收功率测量，可以有效估计BD-RIS的CSI，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), with its
enhanced degrees of freedom compared to conventional RIS, has demonstrated
notable potential for enhancing wireless communication performance. However, a
key challenge in employing BD-RIS lies in accurately acquiring its channel
state information (CSI) with both the base station (BS) and users. Existing
BD-RIS channel estimation methods rely mainly on dedicated pilot signals, which
increase system overhead and may be incompatible with current communication
protocols. To overcome these limitations, this letter proposes a new
single-layer neural network (NN)-enabled channel estimation method utilizing
only the easily accessible received power measurements at user terminals. In
particular, we show that the received signal power can be expressed in a form
similar to a single-layer NN, where the weights represent the BD-RIS's CSI.
This structure enables the recovery of CSI using the backward propagation,
based on power measurements collected under varying training reflection
coefficients. Numerical results show that our proposed method can achieve a
small normalized mean square error (NMSE), particularly when the number of
training reflections is large.

### [4] [Full-Angle Ray Antenna Array and Omnicell Wireless Communication System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05677)
*Xuancheng Zhu,Zhiwen Zhou,Yong Zeng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出全角度射线天线阵（RAA）架构和由其支持的全向小区无线通信范式，旨在降低成本并提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 与传统的混合模拟/数字波束成形（ULA/UCA）相比，RAA架构具有硬件成本低、波束成形增益高、所有方向角分辨率均匀等优点。本文旨在提出一种全角度RAA架构，并探索其在全向小区无线通信系统中的应用。

Method: 提出一种全角度RAA架构，该架构将RAA的方向角扩展到全角度域。基于此架构，提出全向小区无线通信系统概念，其中基站配备全角度RAA并部署在小区中心。

Result: 通过分析和数值结果，将所提出的全角度RAA全向小区系统与传统的基于ULA/UCA的扇区分区系统在空间分辨率和通信速率等关键性能指标上进行了比较。

Conclusion: 所提出的全角度RAA全向小区无线通信系统有望显著降低用户间干扰，提高成本效益，并提供比传统系统更好的性能。

Abstract: Ray antenna array (RAA) was recently proposed as a novel multi-antenna
architecture that arranges multiple massive cheap antenna elements into simple
uniform linear arrays (sULAs) with different orientations. Compared with
traditional architectures like hybrid analog/digital beamforming with uniform
linear array (ULA) and uniform circular array (UCA), RAA has several promising
advantages such as significantly reduced hardware cost, higher beamforming
gains and the ability of providing uniform angular resolution for all
directions. In this paper, we propose a full-angle RAA architecture and an
innovative omnicell wireless communication paradigm enabled by full-angle RAA.
The proposed full-angle RAA expands RAA's orientation angle to the full angle
domain, such that the RAA's advantages can be exploited to all directions. This
further enables the new concept of omnicell wireless communication system, with
the base station equipped by full-angle RAA and deployed at the center of each
cell. Compared to the conventional cell sectoring wireless communication
system, the proposed omnicell system is expected to not only significantly
reduce the inter-user interference, but also improve the cost efficiency.
Extensive analytical and numerical results are provided to compare those key
performance indicators such as the spatial resolution and the communication
rate of the proposed full-angle RAA based omnicell wireless communication
system against the conventional ULA/UCA-based cell sectoring systems.

### [5] [Affine Filter Bank Modulation (AFBM): A Novel 6G ISAC Waveform with Low PAPR and OOBE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05683)
*Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe,Henrique L. Senger,Gustavo P. Gonçalves,Hyeon Seok Rou,Bruno S. Chang,Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu,Didier Le Ruyet*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: AFBM波形在6G ISAC中具有低PAPR和OOBE，并能在通信和感知任务中提供可靠性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为增强6G通信感知一体化（ISAC）系统而设计新的波形。

Method: 提出并分析了AFBM波形，利用GaBP算法进行符号检测，并采用EM辅助PDA进行目标估计。

Result: AFBM波形在双重色散信道下表现出比AFDM更低的PAPR和OOBE。通信和感知任务的评估显示出其可靠性。

Conclusion: AFBM波形是一种有前途的下一代无线系统波形，具有出色的性能和优势。

Abstract: We propose the affine filter bank modulation (AFBM) waveform for enhanced
integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in sixth generation (6G), designed
by drawing on concepts from classical filter bank multicarrier modulation
(FBMC) theory and recent advances in chirp-domain waveforms, particularly
affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). Specifically, AFBM exhibits
several desirable properties, with emphasis on its remarkably low
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and reduced out-of-band emission (OOBE) when
benchmarked against the conventional AFDM waveform under doubly-dispersive (DD)
channel conditions. In the communications setting, reliable symbol detection is
achieved using a tailored low-complexity Gaussian belief propagation
(GaBP)-based algorithm, while in the sensing setting, a range and velocity
estimation approach is developed that integrates an expectation maximization
(EM)-assisted probabilistic data association (PDA) framework to accurately
identify surrounding targets. The highlighted performance and benefits of AFBM
are validated through analytical and numerical evaluations, including
conventional metrics such as ambiguity function (AF), bit error rate (BER), and
root mean square error (RMSE), consolidating its position as a promising
waveform for next-generation wireless systems.

### [6] [Resource Allocation and Beamforming in FIM-Assisted BS and STAR-BD-RIS-Aided NOMA: A Meta-Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05692)
*Armin Farhadi,Maryam Cheraghy,Qingqing Wu,Eduard Jorswieck*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合了FIM和NOMA的无线通信系统，旨在通过联合优化BS波束成形、STAR-BD-RIS矩阵、NOMA约束和FIM表面形状来最大化能源效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在无线通信系统中最大化能源效率，本研究提出了一种新的系统设计。

Method: 本研究提出了一种新的灵活智能超表面（FIM）辅助的无线通信系统，该系统集成了双扇区BD-RIS和NOMA。通过联合优化BS波束成形、STAR-BD-RIS矩阵、NOMA约束和FIM表面形状，并采用Meta-SAC算法来解决非凸性问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，Meta-SAC算法优于Meta-DDPG算法，并且FIM辅助设计相比基准方案能显著提高能源效率。

Conclusion: FIM辅助设计和Meta-SAC算法能够有效提升无线通信系统的能源效率。

Abstract: This study explores a flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM)-based wireless
communication system that integrates simultaneously transmitting and reflecting
beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-BD-RIS) with
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The system features a multi-antenna
FIM-assisted base station (BS) aided by dual-sector BD-RIS. The FIM consists of
cost-effective radiating elements that can independently emit signals and
dynamically adjust their vertical positions ("morphing"). The goal is to
maximize energy efficiency by jointly optimizing BS beamforming, the
STAR-BD-RIS matrix, NOMA constraints, and the FIM surface shape under power
limits. Due to the problem's non-convexity, a meta-soft actor-critic (Meta-SAC)
algorithm is proposed for adaptive optimization. Simulation results show that
Meta-SAC outperforms the Meta-DDPG algorithm, and FIM-assisted designs yield
substantial energy efficiency gains over benchmark schemes.

### [7] [Optimal Anchor Deployment and Topology Design for Large-Scale AUV Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05903)
*Wei Huang,Junpeng Lu,Tianhe Xu,Jianxu Shu,Hao Zhang,Kaitao Meng,Yanan Wu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 水下声学锚的部署拓扑优化对于 AUV 导航至关重要，本文提出了一种拓扑优化方法，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下锚节点部署稀疏、缺乏卫星覆盖且难以维护，影响了 AUV 的导航和定位服务质量。

Method: 提出了一种拓扑优化方法，用于优化水下锚节点的部署，并推导了锚节点数量对导航性能的影响的标度律，最后通过实验评估了优化性能。

Result: 通过实验结果评估了优化性能，证明了所提出方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 优化锚节点部署拓扑可以提供高质量的 AUV 导航和定位服务。

Abstract: Seafloor acoustic anchors are an important component of AUV navigation,
providing absolute updates that correct inertial dead-reckoning. Unlike
terrestrial positioning systems, the deployment of underwater anchor nodes is
usually sparse due to the uneven distribution of underwater users, as well as
the high economic cost and difficult maintenance of underwater equipment. These
anchor nodes lack satellite coverage and cannot form ubiquitous backhaul as
terrestrial nodes do. In this paper, we investigate the optimal anchor
deployment topology to provide high-quality AUV navigation and positioning
services. We first analyze the possible deployment mode in large-scale
underwater navigation system, and formulate a topology optimization for
underwater anchor node deployment. Then, we derive a scaling law about the
influence of anchors in each cluster on the navigation performance within a
given area and demonstrate a service area coverage condition with a high
probability of reaching the destination. Finally, the optimization performance
is evaluated through experimental results.

### [8] [Active noise cancellation in ultra-low field MRI: distinct strategies for different channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05955)
*Jiali He,Sheng Shen,Jiamin Wu,Xiaohan Kong,Yamei Dai,Liang Tan,Zheng Xu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: ULF-MRI系统易受电磁干扰，不同线圈对干扰的响应不同。提出了一种结合空间域重建和自适应噪声消除的双阶段抑制策略，可有效抑制干扰并提高图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放环境下的超低场磁共振成像（ULF-MRI）系统易受复合电磁干扰（EMI），且不同成像通道对EMI的响应不均匀，这阻碍了其成像质量的提高。

Method: 提出了一种双阶段抑制策略：1. 前端采用空间域逆场重建来抑制EMI。2. 后端采用通道自适应有源噪声消除技术来进一步消除剩余的EMI。

Result: 实验证明，该策略可抑制超过80%的EMI，提高通道间信噪比（SNR）的一致性，并使融合图像的SNR提高24%。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了EMI耦合的通道依赖性，并提出了一种有效的、有针对性的EMI抑制方法，为未来ULF-MRI系统的噪声抑制提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Ultra-low field magnetic resonance imaging(ULF-MRI) systems operating in open
environments are highly susceptible to composite electromagnetic
interference(EMI). Different imaging channels respond non-uniformly to EMI
owing to their distinct coupling characteristics. Here, we investigate
channel-specific interference pathways in a permanent-magnet-based low-field
MRI system and show that saddle coils are intrinsically more vulnerable to
transverse EMI components than solenoidal coils. To mitigate these
heterogeneous coupling effects, we propose a dual-stage suppression strategy
that combines front-end spatial-domain inverse field reconstruction with
back-end channel-adaptive active noise cancellation. Experiments demonstrate
that this approach suppresses EMI by more than 80%, substantially improves
inter-channel signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) consistency, and enhances the
fused-image SNR by 24%. These findings elucidate the channel-dependent nature
of EMI coupling and establish targeted mitigation strategies, providing both a
theoretical basis and practical guidance for noise suppression in future
array-coil ULF-MRI systems.

### [10] [DeepStream: Prototyping Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Real-Time Multimedia Transmissions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05971)
*Kaiyi Chi,Yinghui He,Qianqian Yang,Zhiping Jiang,Yuanchao Shu,Zhiqin Wang,Jun Luo,Jiming Chen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种名为DeepStream的基于深度学习的联合信源信道编码（DeepJSCC）原型系统，用于在6G通信中实现高效可靠的多媒体传输，特别是在低信噪比环境下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DeepJSCC研究大多停留在数值模拟阶段，缺乏实际验证，本文旨在通过原型系统验证其在真实世界中的可行性。

Method: DeepStream系统基于OFDM技术，开发了特征到符号映射和跨子载波预编码方法以提高子载波独立性并降低峰均功率比。此外，提出了一种渐进式编码策略，可根据延迟调整压缩比，从而降低系统复杂性并满足不同的服务质量要求。该系统使用软件定义无线电实现了实时图像传输和视频流。

Result: 在10 dB的信噪比下，DeepStream在图像传输方面达到了35 dB的PSNR，在视频流方面达到了20 dB的MS-SSIM，而标准方案则无法恢复有意义的信息。

Conclusion: DeepStream在图像和视频传输方面均优于标准方案和直接部署方案，证明了其在低信噪比环境下进行高效可靠的多媒体传输的有效性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) has emerged as a
promising technique in 6G for enhancing the efficiency and reliability of data
transmission across diverse modalities, particularly in low signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) environments. This advantage is realized by leveraging powerful
neural networks to learn an optimal end-to-end mapping from the source data
directly to the transmit symbol sequence, eliminating the need for separate
source coding, channel coding, and modulation. Although numerous efforts have
been made towards efficient DeepJSCC, they have largely stayed at numerical
simulations that can be far from practice, leaving the real-world viability of
DeepJSCC largely unverified. To this end, we prototype DeepStream upon
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology to offer efficient
and robust DeepJSCC for multimedia transmission. In conforming to OFDM, we
develop both a feature-to-symbol mapping method and a cross-subcarrier
precoding method to improve the subcarrier independence and reduce
peak-to-average power ratio. To reduce system complexity and enable flexibility
in accommodating varying quality of service requirements, we further propose a
progressive coding strategy that adjusts the compression ratio based on latency
with minimal performance loss. We implement DeepStream for real-time image
transmission and video streaming using software-defined radio. Extensive
evaluations verify that DeepStream outperforms both the standard scheme and the
direct deployment scheme. Particularly, at an SNR of 10 dB, DeepStream achieves
a PSNR of 35 dB for image transmission and an MS-SSIM of 20 dB for video
streaming, whereas the standard scheme fails to recover meaningful information.

Abstract: With the advancement of millimeter-wave radar technology, Synthetic Aperture
Radar (SAR) imaging at millimeter-wave frequencies has gained significant
attention in both academic research and industrial applications. However,
traditional SAR imaging algorithms primarily focus on extracting
two-dimensional information from detected targets, which limits their potential
for 3D scene reconstruction. In this work, we demonstrated a fast time-domain
reconstruction algorithm for achieving high-resolution 3D radar imaging at
millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies. This approach leverages a combination of
virtual Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Frequency Modulated Continuous

technique, setting the stage for a new era of advanced radar imaging
applications.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is emerging as a key enabler for
spectrum-efficient and hardware-converged wireless networks. However, classical
radar systems within ISAC architectures face fundamental limitations under low
signal power and high-noise conditions. This paper proposes a novel framework
that embeds quantum illumination radar into a base station to simultaneously
support full-duplex classical communication and quantum-enhanced target
detection. The resulting integrated quantum sensing and classical communication
(IQSCC) system is optimized via a sum-rate maximization formulation subject to
radar sensing constraints. The non-convex joint optimization of transmit power
and beamforming vectors is tackled using the successive convex approximation
technique. Furthermore, we derive performance bounds for classical and quantum
radar protocols under the statistical detection theory, highlighting the
quantum advantage in low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio regimes.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IQSCC system achieves a higher
communication throughput than the conventional ISAC baseline while satisfying
the sensing requirement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在通信安全日益受到关注的背景下，需要一种能够抵抗窃听和干扰的隐蔽通信网络。传统的通信方式难以在保证通信质量的同时实现高水平的隐蔽性，尤其是在存在敌方监听者的情况下。

Method: 本研究提出了一种名为PASS（Sensing-aided covert communication network empowered by pinching antenna systems）的新型通信网络。该网络利用可动态重构的夹天线（PA）来提高隐蔽性。为了获取并利用敌方（warden）的信道状态信息（CSI），引入了传感功能，并采用扩展卡尔曼滤波器（EKF）来跟踪敌方的移动。在此基础上，提出了一种联合优化波束成形、人工噪声（AN）和PA位置的隐蔽通信方案。其中，波束成形和AN的设计采用了子空间法，而PA位置的优化则利用深度强化学习（DRL）方法，并将敌方移动状态的演变视为一个时间修正的过程。

Result: 1. EKF方法能够以较低的复杂度精确跟踪敌方的CSI。 2. 所提出的联合优化方案在性能上优于贪婪算法和基于搜索的基准算法。 3. PASS系统由于引入了新的设计自由度（DoFs），其性能优于传统的全数字MIMO系统。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于夹天线系统的传感辅助隐蔽通信网络（PASS）能够通过动态调整天线位置和联合优化通信参数，有效地提高通信隐蔽性，并能精确跟踪敌方位置，在性能上超越了现有的一些方法和传统系统。

Abstract: A sensing-aided covert communication network empowered by pinching antenna
systems (PASS) is proposed in this work. Unlike conventional fixed-position
MIMO arrays, PASS dynamically reconfigures its pinching antennas (PAs) closer
to the legitimate user, substantially enhancing covertness. To further secure
the adversary's channel state information (CSI), a sensing function is
leveraged to track the malicious warden's movements. In particular, this paper
first proposes an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based approach to fulfilling the
tracking function. Building on this, a covert communication problem is
formulated with a joint design of beamforming, artificial noise (AN) signals,
and the position of PAs. Then, the beamforming and AN design subproblems are
resolved jointly with a subspace approach, while the PA position optimization
subproblem is handled by a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach by
treating the evolution of the warden's mobility status as a temporally
corrected process. Numerical results are presented and demonstrate that: i) the
EKF approach can accurately track the warden's CSI with low complexity, ii) the
effectiveness of the proposed solution is verified by its outperformance over
the greedy and searching-based benchmarks, and iii) with new design degrees of
freedom (DoFs), the performance of PASS is superior to the conventional
fully-digital MIMO systems.

TL;DR: MelodyBedScale利用音乐诱导的床身振动，通过集成物理信息神经网络，实现了对卧床患者的无创、快速、高精度体重估测，平均绝对误差可达1.55公斤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的体重测量方法在紧急医疗场景中，尤其对于活动受限的患者，存在不实用、不准确、耗时耗力等缺点。因此，需要一种非侵入式、快速的床旁体重估测方法。

Conclusion: MelodyBedScale成功地实现了一种非侵入式、快速的床旁体重估测方法，其准确性满足临床需求，为紧急医疗护理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Rapid and accurate body weight estimation is critical in emergency medical
care, as it directly influences treatment decisions, such as drug dosing,
defibrillation energy selection, and fluid resuscitation. Traditional methods
such as stand-on scales, length-based tapes, or transfer-based weighing scales
are often impractical for immobilized patients, inaccurate, or labor-intensive
and time-consuming. This paper introduces MelodyBedScale, a non-intrusive and
rapid on-bed weight estimation system that leverages bed vibration induced by
music. The core insight is that body weight affects the vibration transfer
function of the bed-body system, which is captured using vibration sensors
placed on opposite sides of the bed. First, we identify weight-sensitive
frequency bands and compose clinically acceptable soft, natural music with high
signal energy in these frequency bands. This music is then played through a
speaker mounted on the bed to induce bed vibrations. Additionally, to
efficiently capture the complex weight-vibration relationship with limited data
and enhance generalizability to unseen individuals and weights, we
theoretically analyze the weight-vibration relationship and integrate the
results into the activation functions of the neural network for
physics-informed weight regression. We evaluated MelodyBedScale on both wooden
and steel beds across 11 participants, achieving a mean absolute error of up to
1.55 kg.

Conclusion: 所提出的 PA 畸变感知功率分配策略能够有效提高 M-MIMO OFDM 系统的和速率，证明了考虑 PA 畸变的重要性。

Abstract: Real-world wireless transmitter front-ends exhibit certain nonlinear
behavior, e.g., signal clipping by a Power Amplifier (PA). Although many
resource allocation solutions do not consider this for simplicity, it leads to
inaccurate results or a reduced number of degrees of freedom, not achieving the
global performance. In this work, we propose an optimal PA distortion-aware
power allocation strategy in a downlink orthogonal frequency division multiplex
(OFDM) based massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) system. Assuming a
soft-limiter PA model, where the transmission occurs under small-scale
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) Rayleigh fading channel, we
derive the wideband signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and formulate
the power allocation problem. Most interestingly, the distortion introduced by
the PA leads to an SNDR-efficient operating point without explicit transmit
power constraints. While the optimization problem is non-convex, we decouple it
into a non-convex total power allocation problem and a convex power
distribution problem among the users (UEs). We propose an alternating
optimization algorithm to find the optimum solution. Our simulation results
show significant sum-rate gains over existing distortion-neglecting solutions,
e.g., a median 4 times increase and a median 50\% increase for a 64-antenna and
512-antenna base station serving 60 users, respectively.

Motivation: 为了实现低延迟的多智能体协同感知，需要对激光雷达点云进行高效传输，以克服其海量数据的问题。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables more accurate and comprehensive scene
understanding by learning how to share information between agents, with LiDAR
point clouds providing essential precise spatial data. Due to the substantial
data volume generated by LiDAR sensors, efficient point cloud transmission is
essential for low-latency multi-agent collaboration. In this work, we propose
an efficient, robust and applicable LiDAR point cloud transmission system via
the Synesthesia of Machines (SoM), termed LiDAR Point Cloud Feature
Transmission (LPC-FT), to support collaborative perception among multiple
agents. Specifically, we employ a density-preserving deep point cloud
compression method that encodes the complete point cloud into a downsampled
efficient representation. To mitigate the effects of the wireless channel, we
design a channel encoder module based on self-attention to enhance LiDAR point
cloud features and a feature fusion module based on cross-attention to
integrate features from transceivers. Furthermore, we utilize the nonlinear
activation layer and transfer learning to improve the training of deep neural
networks in the presence the digital channel noise. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed LPC-FT is more robust and effective than
traditional octree-based compression followed by channel coding, and
outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning-based compression techniques and
existing semantic communication methods, reducing the Chamfer Distance by 30%
and improving the PSNR by 1.9 dB on average. Owing to its superior
reconstruction performance and robustness against channel variations, LPC-FT is
expected to support collaborative perception tasks.

Abstract: Detection and tracking are the basic tasks of radar systems. Current joint
detection tracking methods, which focus on dynamically adjusting detection
thresholds from tracking results, still present challenges in fully utilizing
the potential of radar signals. These are mainly reflected in the limited
capacity of the constant false-alarm rate model to accurately represent
information, the insufficient depiction of complex scenes, and the limited
information acquired by the tracker. We introduce the Integrated Detection and
Tracking based on radar feature (InDT) method, which comprises a network
architecture for radar signal detection and a tracker that leverages detection
assistance. The InDT detector extracts feature information from each
Range-Doppler (RD) matrix and then returns the target position through the
feature enhancement module and the detection head. The InDT tracker adaptively
updates the measurement noise covariance of the Kalman filter based on
detection confidence. The similarity of target RD features is measured by
cosine distance, which enhances the data association process by combining
location and feature information. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method
was validated through testing on both simulated data and publicly available
datasets.

Abstract: In environments where visual sensors falter, in-air sonar provides a reliable
alternative for autonomous systems. While previous research has successfully
classified individual acoustic landmarks, this paper takes a step towards
increasing information capacity by introducing reflector constellations as
encoded tags. Our primary contribution is a multi-label Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) designed to simultaneously identify multiple, closely spaced
reflectors from a single in-air 3D sonar measurement. Our initial findings on a
small dataset confirm the feasibility of this approach, validating the ability
to decode these complex acoustic patterns. Secondly, we investigated using
adaptive beamforming with null-steering to isolate individual reflectors for
single-label classification. Finally, we discuss the experimental results and
limitations, offering key insights and future directions for developing
acoustic landmark systems with significantly increased information entropy and
their accurate and robust detection and classification.

Abstract: Massive MIMO systems have the potential to significantly enhance spectral
efficiency, yet their widespread integration is hindered by the high power
consumption of the underlying computations. This paper explores the
applicability and effectiveness of Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) for
massive MIMO signal processing to tackle the reliability challenge of Near
Threshold Computing (NTC). We propose modifying matrix arithmetic Newton
iteration MIMO algorithm to seamlessly integrate ABFT to detect any
computational errors by inspecting the final result. The overhead from ABFT
depends largely on the matrix dimensions, which in this context are dictated by
the number of user equipments involved in the computation. NTC is a promising
strategy for reducing the energy consumption in digital circuits by operating
transistors at extremely reduced voltages. However, NTC is highly susceptible
to variations in Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) which can lead to
increased error rates in computations. Traditional techniques for enabling NTC,
such as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling guided by circuit level timing
error detection methods, introduce considerable hardware complexity and are
difficult to implement at high clock frequencies. In this context ABFT has
emerged as a lightweight error detection method tailored for matrix operations
without requiring any modifications on circuit-level and can be implemented
purely in software.A MIMO accelerator was implemented on a reconfigurable
hardware platform. Experimental results demonstrate that for sufficiently large
problem sizes, the proposed method achieves a 36% power saving compared to
baseline, with only an average of 3% computational overhead, at default clock
frequency. These results indicate that combining ABFT with near-threshold
operation provides a viable path toward energy-efficient and robust massive
MIMO processors.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of resource efficiency maximization in an
active simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent
surface (STAR-RIS) assisted communication system under practical transceiver
hardware impairments (HWIs). We aim to obtain an optimal tradeoff between
system spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE), by jointly
optimizing the base station (BS) transmit beamforming and the active STAR-RIS
beamforming. To tackle the challenges in the fractional objective function, we
begin by applying the quadratic transformation method to simplify it into a
manageable form. An alternating optimization-based algorithm is then developed
to iteratively update the BS and STAR-RIS beamforming coefficients. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs better than other
baseline schemes in the presence of HWIs. Moreover, the variation of the
achievable SE-EE region with different transmit power budgets is analyzed.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is emerging as a cornerstone
technology for sixth generation (6G) wireless systems, unifying connectivity
and environmental mapping through shared hardware, spectrum, and waveforms. The
following paper presents an ISAC imaging framework utilizing channel state
information (CSI) per-path components, transmitter (TX) positions, and receiver
(RX) positions obtained from the calibrated NYURay ray tracer at 6.75 GHz in
the upper mid-band. Our work shows how each resolvable multipath component can
be extracted from CSI estimation and cast into an equivalent three-dimensional
reflection point by fusing its angle and delay information, which is useful and
challenging for multi-bounce reflections. The primary contribution of the paper
is the two-segment reflection point optimization algorithm, which independently
estimates the path lengths from the TX position and RX position to an
equivalent reflection point (ERP) on the object surface, thus enabling precise
geometric reconstruction. Subsequently, we aggregate the ERPs derived from
multiple pairs of TX and RX positions, generating dense three dimensional point
clouds representing the objects in the channel. Experimental results validate
that the proposed ISAC imaging framework accurately reconstructs object
surfaces, edges, and curved features. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
provides the first demonstration of multi bounce ISAC imaging using wireless
ray tracing at 6.75 GHz.

Abstract: Radar-based human activity recognition (HAR) is a pivotal research area for
applications requiring non-invasive monitoring. However, the acquisition of
diverse and high-fidelity radar datasets for robust algorithm development
remains a significant challenge. To overcome this bottleneck, a model-based
frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar HAR simulator is developed.
The simulator integrates an anthropometrically scaled $13$-scatterer kinematic
model to simulate $12$ distinct activities. The FMCW radar echo model is
employed, which incorporates dynamic radar cross-section (RCS), free-space or
through-the-wall propagation, and a calibrated noise floor to ensure signal
fidelity. The simulated raw data is then processed through a complete pipeline,
including moving target indication (MTI), bulk Doppler compensation, and
Savitzky-Golay denoising, culminating in the generation of high-resolution
range-time map (RTM) and Doppler-time maps (DTMs) via both short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) and Fourier synchrosqueezed transform (FSST). Finally, a novel
neural network method is proposed to validate the effectiveness of the radar
HAR. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the simulator successfully
generates high-fidelity and distinct micro-Doppler signature, which provides a
valuable tool for radar HAR algorithm design and validation. The installer of
this simulator is released at:

Abstract: In this paper, a green learning (GL)-based precoding framework is proposed
for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent
surface (STAR-RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO broadcasting systems.
Motivated by the growing emphasis on environmental sustainability in future 6G
networks, this work adopts a broadcasting transmission architecture for
scenarios where multiple users share identical information, improving spectral
efficiency and reducing redundant transmissions and power consumption.
Different from conventional optimization methods, such as block coordinate
descent (BCD) that require perfect channel state information (CSI) and
iterative computation, the proposed GL framework operates directly on received
uplink pilot signals without explicit CSI estimation. Unlike deep learning (DL)
approaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach
also avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more
lightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with
supervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully
CSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with
adjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature
selection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to
jointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder. Simulation
results show that the proposed GL approach achieves competitive spectral
efficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models, while reducing floating-point
operations (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude. These advantages make the
proposed GL approach highly suitable for real-time deployment in energy- and
hardware-constrained broadcasting scenarios.
