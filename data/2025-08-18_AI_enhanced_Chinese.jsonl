In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals\nwith actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven\ndecisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual\n(i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world\napplications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing\noutcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the\ninherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact\nand compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel\nframework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple\nrecourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction\nas a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided\nby both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse\ncosts, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap\nbetween individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a\nthree-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal\ncapacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware\noptimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs.\nExperimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that\nour framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve\nnear-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings.

However, existing feature interaction\nstrategies face two critical challenges in industrial applications: (1) The\nvast number of categorical and sequential features makes exhaustive interaction\ncomputationally prohibitive, often resulting in optimization difficulties. (2)\nReal-world recommender systems typically involve multiple prediction\nobjectives, yet most current approaches apply feature interaction modules prior\nto the multi-task learning layers. This late-fusion design overlooks\ntask-specific feature dependencies and inherently limits the capacity of\nmulti-task modeling. To address these limitations, we propose the Information\nFlow Network (INFNet), a task-aware architecture designed for large-scale\nrecommendation scenarios. INFNet distinguishes features into three token types,\ncategorical tokens, sequence tokens, and task tokens, and introduces a novel\ndual-flow design comprising heterogeneous and homogeneous alternating\ninformation blocks. For heterogeneous information flow, we employ a\ncross-attention mechanism with proxy that facilitates efficient cross-modal\ntoken interaction with balanced computational cost. For homogeneous flow, we\ndesign type-specific Proxy Gated Units (PGUs) to enable fine-grained intra-type\nfeature processing.

To achieve this,\nexperience-demanding objective parameter adjustment and computationally\nexpensive inverse optimization are performed iteratively. Extensive efforts\nhave been made to automatically adjust objective parameters, but the most\ntime-consuming component, i.e., inverse optimization, still relies heavily on\ntheory-driven approaches. We propose a data-driven inverse optimizer and\nintegrate it into a PPO-based automatic treatment planning framework to\nautomatically generate high-quality plans within a clinical acceptable planning\ntime. The inverse optimizer is a L2O method that predicts update steps by\nlearning from the task-specific data distribution. For the first time, we\nintegrate techniques designed for long-context processing, originally developed\nfor LLMs, into a Transformer-based L2O framework to address the scalability\nissue of existing L2O methods. The PPO framework functions as an outer-loop\nvirtual planner, autonomously adjusting objective parameters through a policy\nnetwork, and the dose predictor is used to initialize objective parameters. The\ninner-loop L2O inverse optimizer computes machine-deliverable MU values based\non objectives refined by the PPO policy network. 97 patients are collected in\nthis study, and compared with L-BFGSB, our L2O-based inverse optimizer improves\nthe effectiveness and efficiency by 22.97% and 36.41%, respectively.

More specifically, we study\ntwo prominent alternatives to the standard notion of admissibility from\nabstract argumentation, namely strong and weak admissibility, and introduce the\nrespective preferred, complete and grounded semantics for general (sometimes\ncalled non-flat) ABA. To do so, we use abstract bipolar set-based argumentation\nframeworks (BSAFs) as formal playground since they concisely capture the\nrelations between assumptions and are expressive enough to represent general\nnon-flat ABA frameworks, as recently shown. While weak admissibility has been\nrecently investigated for a restricted fragment of ABA in which assumptions\ncannot be derived (flat ABA), strong admissibility has not been investigated\nfor ABA so far.

Remarkably, a 3B model trained for\n180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token\nbudget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on\nsynthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to\nrephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality.\nOverall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating\nhigh-quality synthetic pretraining data.

As KGs grow at different rates and scales in real-world\nscenarios, existing CKGE methods often fail to consider the varying scales of\nupdates and lack systematic evaluation throughout the entire update process. In\nthis paper, we propose SAGE, a scale-aware gradual evolution framework for\nCKGE.

Aside from regression\ntasks, we also construct optimal zono-conformal predictors in classification\nsettings where the output of an uncertain predictor is a set of possible\nclasses. We provide probabilistic coverage guarantees and present methods for\ndetecting outliers in the identification data. In extensive numerical\nexperiments, we show that zono-conformal predictors are less conservative than\ninterval predictor models and standard conformal prediction methods, while\nachieving a similar coverage over the test data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165zono-\u7b26\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u8f93\u51fa\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7b26\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u5927\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u4e3a\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u591a\u7ef4\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528zonotope\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u6311\u9009\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "zono-\u7b26\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5c11\u4fdd\u5b88\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "zono-\u7b26\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3a\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u7b26\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

Recently, researchers have explored the\neffectiveness of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate helpful\nactions and states to prune the search space. However, prior works have largely\noverlooked integrating LLMs with domain-specific knowledge to ensure valid\nplans. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-assisted planner integrated with\nproblem decomposition, which first decomposes large planning problems into\nmultiple simpler sub-tasks. Then we explore two novel paradigms to utilize\nLLMs, i.e., LLM4Inspire and LLM4Predict, to assist problem decomposition, where\nLLM4Inspire provides heuristic guidance according to general knowledge and\nLLM4Predict employs domain-specific knowledge to infer intermediate conditions.\nWe empirically validate the effectiveness of our planner across multiple\ndomains, demonstrating the ability of search space partition when solving\nlarge-scale planning problems. The experimental results show that LLMs\neffectively locate feasible solutions when pruning the search space, where\ninfusing domain-specific knowledge into LLMs, i.e., LLM4Predict, holds\nparticular promise compared with LLM4Inspire, which offers general knowledge\nwithin LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5229\u7528LLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0f\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fc7\u5927\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u79cdLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08LLM4Inspire\u548cLLM4Predict\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u4e2d\u95f4\u6761\u4ef6\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0f\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684LLM4Predict\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684LLM\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While promising, this task\nis challenging because each student typically has only a few QA records, which\noften lack the student's underlying reasoning processes, making training-based\ngroup-level approaches infeasible.

Compressive learning is a\nframework that enables efficient processing by using random, non-linear\nfeatures to project large-scale databases onto compact, information-preserving\nrepresentations whose dimensionality is independent of the number of samples\nand can be easily stored, transferred, and processed. These database-level\nsummaries are then used to decode parameters of interest from the underlying\ndata distribution without requiring access to the original samples, offering an\nefficient and privacy-friendly learning framework. However, both the encoding\nand decoding techniques are typically randomized and data-independent, failing\nto exploit the underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose a\nframework that meta-learns both the encoding and decoding stages of compressive\nlearning methods by using neural networks that provide faster and more accurate\nsystems than the current state-of-the-art approaches.

Traditional\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods primarily focus on coarse-grained\ntextual semantic similarity and ignore structural associations among dispersed\nknowledge, which limits their effectiveness in MHQA tasks. GraphRAG methods\naddress this by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture structural\nassociations, but they tend to overly rely on structural information and\nfine-grained word- or phrase-level retrieval, resulting in an underutilization\nof textual semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG approach called\nHGRAG for MHQA that achieves cross-granularity integration of structural and\nsemantic information via hypergraphs. Structurally, we construct an entity\nhypergraph where fine-grained entities serve as nodes and coarse-grained\npassages as hyperedges, and establish knowledge association through shared\nentities.

Webb"], "title": "Towards the Next-generation Bayesian Network Classifiers", "comment": null, "summary": "Bayesian network classifiers provide a feasible solution to tabular data\nclassification, with a number of merits like high time and memory efficiency,\nand great explainability. However, due to the parameter explosion and data\nsparsity issues, Bayesian network classifiers are restricted to low-order\nfeature dependency modeling, making them struggle in extrapolating the\noccurrence probabilities of complex real-world data. In this paper, we propose\na novel paradigm to design high-order Bayesian network classifiers, by learning\ndistributional representations for feature values, as what has been done in\nword embedding and graph representation learning. The learned distributional\nrepresentations are encoded with the semantic relatedness between different\nfeatures through their observed co-occurrence patterns in training data, which\nthen serve as a hallmark to extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of new\ntest samples. As a classifier design realization, we remake the K-dependence\nBayesian classifier (KDB) by extending it into a neural version, i.e.,\nNeuralKDB, where a novel neural network architecture is designed to learn\ndistributional representations of feature values and parameterize the\nconditional probabilities between interdependent features. A stochastic\ngradient descent based algorithm is designed to train the NeuralKDB model\nefficiently. Extensive classification experiments on 60 UCI datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed NeuralKDB classifier excels in capturing\nhigh-order feature dependencies and significantly outperforms the conventional\nBayesian network classifiers, as well as other competitive classifiers,\nincluding two neural network based classifiers without distributional\nrepresentation learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u9636\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u7c7b\u5668NeuralKDB\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u9ad8\u9636\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5e03\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6269\u5c55K-dependence\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u572860\u4e2aUCI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "NeuralKDB\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u9636\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5927\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Using a multivariate dataset collected from an industrial\narea in Beijing between 2010 and 2015 -- which includes hourly records of PM2.5\nconcentration, temperature, dew point, pressure, wind direction, wind speed,\nand precipitation -- the model predicts the average PM2.5 concentration over\n6-hour intervals. Experimental results show that the model achieves a root mean\nsquare error (RMSE) of 5.236, outperforming traditional time series models in\nboth accuracy and generalization. This demonstrates its strong potential in\nreal-world applications such as air pollution early warning systems. However,\ndue to the complexity of multivariate inputs, the model demands high\ncomputational resources, and its ability to handle diverse atmospheric factors\nstill requires optimization. Future work will focus on enhancing scalability\nand expanding support for more complex multivariate weather prediction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408CNN\u548cLSTM\u7684\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d28\u91cfPM2.5\u6307\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d28\u91cf\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fPM2.5\u6d53\u5ea6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u73af\u5883\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u516c\u5171\u5065\u5eb7\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u53d6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5317\u4eac\u5de5\u4e1a\u533a\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff0cRMSE\u8fbe5.236\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6c14\u8c61\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In this work, we revisit\nthe adversarial robustness of SNNs through the lens of temporal ensembling,\ntreating the network as a collection of evolving sub-networks across discrete\ntimesteps. This formulation uncovers two critical but underexplored\nchallenges-the fragility of individual temporal sub-networks and the tendency\nfor adversarial vulnerabilities to transfer across time. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Robust Temporal self-Ensemble (RTE), a training\nframework that improves the robustness of each sub-network while reducing the\ntemporal transferability of adversarial perturbations. RTE integrates both\nobjectives into a unified loss and employs a stochastic sampling strategy for\nefficient optimization.

The emerging\nmodularizing-while-training (MwT) paradigm, which incorporates modularization\ninto training, outperforms modularizing-after-training approaches. However,\nexisting MwT methods focus on small-scale CNN models at the convolutional\nkernel level and struggle with diverse DNNs and large-scale models,\nparticularly Transformer-based models.

Building on research on fairness and\ndiscrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias --\ndiscrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human\nanimals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)\nSpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral\nevaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures\ncomparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation\ntasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In\nour benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely\ncondemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On\npsychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower\nexplicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose\nto save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that\nLLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities\nwere equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described\nas more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In\nopen-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized\nharm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.\nThese findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and\nmainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms\naround animal exploitation.

While\nexisting approaches have explored several strategies, such as resampling and\nreweighting, for imbalanced data stream learning, our work distinguishes itself\nby addressing the imbalance problem through training modification, particularly\nfocusing on gradient descent techniques. We introduce the harmonized gradient\ndescent (HGD) algorithm, which aims to equalize the norms of gradients across\ndifferent classes. By ensuring the gradient norm balance, HGD mitigates\nunder-fitting for minor classes and achieves balanced online learning. Notably,\nHGD operates in a streamlined implementation process, requiring no data-buffer,\nextra parameters, or prior knowledge, making it applicable to any learning\nmodels utilizing gradient descent for optimization.

Gradient-based DFL requires computing\nthe derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the\npredicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear\nprograms (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted\nparameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches\nfor LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP\ninto a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer\nand then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that\nhave informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former\napproach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the\nregret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address\nthis, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable\noptimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that minimizing surrogate losses allows differentiable\noptimization layers to achieve regret comparable to or better than\nsurrogate-loss based DFL methods. Further, we demonstrate that this also holds\nfor DYS-Net, a recently proposed differentiable optimization technique for LPs,\nthat computes approximate solutions and gradients through operations that can\nbe performed using feedforward neural network layers. Because DYS-Net executes\nthe forward and the backward pass very efficiently, by minimizing surrogate\nlosses using DYS-Net, we are able to attain regret on par with the\nstate-of-the-art while reducing training time by a significant margin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u635f\u5931\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u540e\u6094\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u51b3\u7b56\u5bfc\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u68af\u5ea6\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e3a\u96f6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u5bfc\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u4f18\u5316\u5c42\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u635f\u5931\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e73\u6ed1\u6216\u5b50\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u540e\u6094\u503c\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u7b49\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5305\u62ecDYS-Net\u5728\u5185\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u53ef\u5fae\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

However, existing methods for CBT learning\nsuch as conventional machine learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) are\nhindered by several limitations. These include: (i) poor interpretability due\nto their black-box nature, (ii) high computational cost, and (iii) an exclusive\nfocus on structure and topology, overlooking the cognitive capacity of the\ngenerated CBT. To address these challenges, we introduce mCOCO (multi-sensory\nCOgnitive COmputing), a novel framework that leverages Reservoir Computing (RC)\nto learn population-level functional CBT from BOLD\n(Blood-Oxygen-level-Dependent) signals. RC's dynamic system properties allow\nfor tracking state changes over time, enhancing interpretability and enabling\nthe modeling of brain-like dynamics, as demonstrated in prior literature. By\nintegrating multi-sensory inputs (e.g., text, audio, and visual data), mCOCO\ncaptures not only structure and topology but also how brain regions process\ninformation and adapt to cognitive tasks such as sensory processing, all in a\ncomputationally efficient manner. Our mCOCO framework consists of two phases:\n(1) mapping BOLD signals into the reservoir to derive individual functional\nconnectomes, which are then aggregated into a group-level CBT - an approach, to\nthe best of our knowledge, not previously explored in functional connectivity\nstudies - and (2) incorporating multi-sensory inputs through a cognitive\nreservoir, endowing the CBT with cognitive traits. Extensive evaluations show\nthat our mCOCO-based template significantly outperforms GNN-based CBT in terms\nof centeredness, discriminativeness, topological soundness, and multi-sensory\nmemory retention.

Conventional explainable\nartificial-intelligence methods clarify individual predictions but overlook the\nupstream decisions and downstream quality checks that determine whether\ninsights can be trusted. In this work, we present Holistic Explainable\nArtificial Intelligence (HXAI), a user-centric framework that embeds\nexplanation into every stage of the data-analysis workflow and tailors those\nexplanations to users. HXAI unifies six components (data, analysis set-up,\nlearning process, model output, model quality, communication channel) into a\nsingle taxonomy and aligns each component with the needs of domain experts,\ndata analysts and data scientists. A 112-item question bank covers these needs;\nour survey of contemporary tools highlights critical coverage gaps. Grounded in\ntheories of human explanation, principles from human-computer interaction and\nfindings from empirical user studies, HXAI identifies the characteristics that\nmake explanations clear, actionable and cognitively manageable.

In the infinite-width limit, NTKs can easily be\ncomputed for most common architectures, yielding full analytic control over the\ntraining dynamics. However, at infinite width, important properties of training\nsuch as NTK evolution or feature learning are absent. Nevertheless, finite\nwidth effects can be included by computing corrections to the Gaussian\nstatistics at infinite width. We introduce Feynman diagrams for computing\nfinite-width corrections to NTK statistics.

Given the complexity, scale,\nand long-term nature of CCS operations, determining whether individual\nstakeholders can independently maximize their interests or whether\ncollaborative coalition agreements are needed remains a central question for\neffective CCS project planning and management. CCS projects are often\nimplemented in geologically connected sites, where shared geological features\nsuch as pressure space and reservoir pore capacity can lead to competitive\nbehavior among stakeholders. Furthermore, CO2 storage sites are often located\nin geologically mature basins that previously served as sites for hydrocarbon\nextraction or wastewater disposal in order to leverage existing\ninfrastructures, which makes unilateral optimization even more complicated and\nunrealistic.\n  In this work, we propose a paradigm based on Markov games to quantitatively\ninvestigate how different coalition structures affect the goals of\nstakeholders. We frame this multi-stakeholder multi-site problem as a\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning problem with safety constraints. Our\napproach enables agents to learn optimal strategies while compliant with safety\nregulations. We present an example where multiple operators are injecting CO2\ninto their respective project areas in a geologically connected basin. To\naddress the high computational cost of repeated simulations of high-fidelity\nmodels, a previously developed surrogate model based on the Embed-to-Control\n(E2C) framework is employed. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed framework in addressing optimal management of CO2 storage when\nmultiple stakeholders with various objectives and goals are involved.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u591a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005CO2\u50a8\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u7ad9\u70b9\u3001\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u78b3\u6355\u83b7\u4e0e\u5c01\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5408\u4f5c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u78b3\u6355\u83b7\u4e0e\u5c01\u5b58\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u591a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u56e0\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u804c\u8d23\u4e0d\u540c\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0a\u7684\u534f\u540c\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u591a\u7ad9\u70b9\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e26\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528Embed-to-Control\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u8054\u76df\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316CO2\u50a8\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5408\u4f5c\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5408\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u78b3\u5c01\u5b58\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u591a\u65b9\u534f\u4f5c\u5171\u8d62\u3002"}}
