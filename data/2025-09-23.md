*Huaiyu Chen,Fahed Hassanat,Robert Laganiere,Martin Bouchard*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: mRadNet是一个新颖、紧凑的雷达目标检测模型，在CRUW数据集上达到了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车行业的FMCW雷达在恶劣天气条件下具有鲁棒性，适用于高级驾驶员辅助系统，但这些系统对模型的紧凑性和效率有要求，而以往的工作却忽略了这一点。

Method: mRadNet采用U-net风格的架构，并结合MetaFormer块，使用可分离卷积和注意力令牌混合器来捕捉局部和全局特征，并引入更高效的令牌嵌入和合并策略以实现轻量化设计。

Result: 在CRUW数据集上，mRadNet的性能得到了验证，并取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: mRadNet在CRUW数据集上达到了最先进的性能，并满足了实时嵌入式系统对模型紧凑性和效率的要求。

Abstract: Frequency-modulated continuous wave radars have gained increasing popularity
in the automotive industry. Its robustness against adverse weather conditions
makes it a suitable choice for radar object detection in advanced driver
assistance systems. These real-time embedded systems have requirements for the
compactness and efficiency of the model, which have been largely overlooked in
previous work. In this work, we propose mRadNet, a novel radar object detection
model with compactness in mind. mRadNet employs a U-net style architecture with
MetaFormer blocks, in which separable convolution and attention token mixers
are used to capture both local and global features effectively. More efficient
token embedding and merging strategies are introduced to further facilitate the
lightweight design of the model. The performance of mRadNet is validated on the
CRUW dataset, improving state-of-the-art performance.

### [2] [Power Spectral Density Estimation via Universal Truncated Order Statistics Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16359)
*David Campos Anchieta,John R. Buck*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 通过自适应权重对不同秩次的顺序统计滤波（OSF）进行凸组合，以动态滤除水声数据中的瞬态噪声，并最小化背景噪声功率谱密度估计的方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于顺序统计滤波（OSF）的水声噪声功率谱密度（PSD）估计方法在滤除瞬态噪声时，需要手动选择最优秩次，这在动态变化的海洋环境中难以实时调整，从而导致估计偏差和方差增大。

Method: 提出一种新的凸组合OSF方法，该方法将不同秩次的OSF进行加权组合，并根据最近时间窗口内的方差动态调整各秩次权重，优先选择方差小的OSF，以实现对瞬态噪声的自适应滤除。

Result: 仿真和真实数据结果表明，所提出的凸组合OSF方法能够有效滤除水声数据中的瞬态噪声，且无需预设阈值秩次，同时保证了PSD估计的低偏差和低方差，性能逼近最优固定秩次OSF。

Conclusion: 所提出的自适应凸组合OSF方法能够有效解决传统OSF方法在动态环境中秩次选择困难的问题，为水声背景噪声PSD估计提供了更鲁棒、更自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: Loud transient signals in underwater acoustic data increase the bias and
variance of background noise power spectral density (PSD) estimates based on
sample mean. Recently, two PSD estimators mitigated the loud transient impact
on PSD estimates by applying order statistics filtering (OSF). The first, the
Schwock and Abadi Welch Percentile, scales a single rank order statistic (OS)
of consecutive periodograms. The second, the truncated linear order statistics
filter, is a weighted sum of OS up to a chosen rank. In order to minimize
variance, both OSFs must carefully choose the highest rank that still
eliminates the loud transients. However, in real-time applications in dynamic
environments, loud transients occur at unpredictable rates, requiring dynamic
adjustment of the OSF ranks to keep low bias and variance. To circumvent the
challenges of real-time rank selection, this paper proposes a convex sum of
OSFs across ranks with blending weights that are sequentially adjusted to favor
the lowest variance OSFs over a recent time window. The performance of the
blended sum provably approaches the performance of the best fixed rank OSF.
Simulations and real data confirm the blended OSFs effectively filter loud
transients out of spectrograms without explicitly choosing a threshold rank.

*Ayla Eftekhari,Maryam Cheraghy,Armin Farhadi,Mohammad Robat Mili,Qingqing Wu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种结合柔性智能超表面（FIM）和全双工智能反射面（STAR-BD-RIS）的混合系统架构，旨在通过联合优化FIM配置、波束赋形和STAR-BD-RIS相位，最大化单用户接收功率和可实现的总和速率，并提出了一种基于元学习的TD3（Meta-TD3）算法来解决非凸优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 本论文提出的混合系统架构和Meta-TD3算法能够有效提升无线通信系统的性能。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and flexible intelligent
metasurfaces (FIM) have been widely adopted in multi-user wireless
communication systems to enhance channel quality through simultaneous
transmission and reflection of signals and three-dimensional reconfiguration of
antennas. In this paper, we propose a novel system architecture that integrates
the benefits of both technologies by deploying an FIM antenna at the base
station (BS) and a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting beyond diagonal
RIS (STAR-BD-RIS) along the transmission path to ensure sufficient received
power for single-antenna users. The objective is to maximize the achievable sum
rate considering the short block length by jointly optimizing the FIM surface
configuration, the transmit beamforming vector, and STAR-BD-RIS phase shift
matrix subject to practical constraints including minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), power limitations, FIM
constraint, and the STAR-BD-RIS phase-shift matrix. To solve the resulting
non-convex optimization problem, we develop a learning-based approach that
incorporates meta-learning into the twin delayed deep deterministic policy
gradient (TD3) algorithm, referred to as Meta-TD3. The simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed hybrid system outperforms conventional
configurations employing either FIM or RIS alone, while the Meta-TD3 algorithm
achieves superior performance compared to classic learning techniques.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于可穿戴传感器的手臂振动暴露测量方法，并通过误差最小化传递函数将测量值与ISO标准进行比对，以实现对有害振动的实时、低成本监测和预防。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有ISO 5349-1标准在受控条件下使用高精度加速度计测量振动暴露的局限性，本研究旨在探索一种更实用、成本更低的手臂振动暴露监测方法。

Method: 本研究采用可穿戴传感器收集振动数据，并开发一种误差最小化传递函数，该函数能考虑阻尼效应，将不同传感器位置的振动数据映射，以获得与ISO标准可比的值。实验中，研究对象进行锤钻混凝土操作，并使用三个不同采样频率的加速度计进行测量。

Abstract: Field workers are frequently exposed to hazardous vibrations, increasing the
risk of Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS) and other long-term health problems.
ISO 5349-1 provides guidelines for measuring vibration exposure. However, this
standard was established in controlled conditions using high-quality
accelerometers directly attached to power tool handles. This study investigates
an alternative, wearable sensor-based data collection process and develops an
error-minimization transfer function that derives values comparable to ISO
benchmarks for safety monitoring. Experiments are performed with subjects
hammer drilling into concrete while vibrations are measured using three
accelerometers at different sampling frequencies. The transfer function maps
vibration data across sensor positions by accounting for damping effects. The
findings indicate a significant reduction in acceleration between the palm and
upper arm, highlight the impact of sampling frequency on data accuracy, and
enable accurate comparison of true hand-arm vibration levels with existing
standard limits to allow accessible, real-time, and cost-effective HAVS
prevention.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于拖曳声呐阵列系统的动态模型，以解决在船舶机动时传感器阵列位置不确定的问题，并结合最大互熵准则卡尔曼滤波器处理非高斯噪声，提高了目标状态估计的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在被动无源测向跟踪（BOT）中，拖曳传感器阵列系统的精确位置对于高效可靠的目标状态估计至关重要，但船舶机动时该系统位置会变得不确定。现有方法通过暂停更新或假设固定位置来处理，导致估计不可靠。

Conclusion: 所提出的拖曳声呐阵列系统动态模型和最大互熵准则卡尔曼滤波器能够有效解决拖曳阵列系统在船舶机动时的位置不确定性和测量噪声问题，显著提升了被动无源测向跟踪的性能。

Abstract: Passive bearing-only tracking (BOT) estimates the target states by utilising
noisy bearing measurements captured by a sensor array. The sensor array is
often towed behind the ship, using a long flexible cable to reduce interference
from the own-ship's inherent noises. This forms a towed cable sensor-array
system (TCSAS). During BOT, the tow-ship has to perform a manoeuvre to make the
tracking system observable. Such a manoeuvre destabilises the TCSAS, thus
making its exact location unknown \emph{w.r.t.} tow-ship. However, it is very
crucial to know the exact location of the towed sensor-array to perform
efficient and reliable target state estimation. The existing BOT approaches
perform TMA during own-ship manoeuvre either by pausing the measurement
updation step of the estimation algorithm or assuming a fixed aft position for
the towed sensor-array. These assumptions lead to unreliable state estimation.
To address this, we propose a dynamic model for TCSAS, using a lumped mass
approach, which will provide the location of the sensor array during the
own-ship manoeuvre. This location will be fed to the state estimation
algorithm. The dynamic of TCSAS in 3D space is obtained by solving the
equations obtained from the moment balance condition and quasi-static
equilibrium condition at the lumped mass points. Moreover, the bearing data
captured by the towed sensor-array is corrupted with non-Gaussian noise. It is
handled using the maximum correntropy criterion based Kalman filter with a
kernel bandwidth selection technique, proposed in this paper. The proposed
sensor-array dynamic model is verified for a real-world BOT engagement
scenario.

*Dilshara Herath,Chinthaka Abeyrathne,Chamindu Adithya,Chathura Seneviratne*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 利用谱相关密度（SCD）图像和深度学习进行轴承故障诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统轴承故障诊断方法在处理复杂、非平稳的振动信号时存在局限性，早期故障检测对于避免灾难性故障和昂贵的紧急维修至关重要。

Method: 将振动信号处理成2D SCD图像以揭示故障特有的周期性，并使用三种卷积神经网络（CNN）模型（Custom CNN、ResNet152V2、EfficientNetB0）对七种轴承工况进行分类。

Result: Custom CNN在A和B壳体上的准确率分别为96.58%和94.95%，ResNet152V2分别为96.49%和95.35%，EfficientNetB0分别为94.16%和91.65%。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在不同壳体上均表现出高精度，证明了其作为一种适用于近端传感平台、可部署的、具有成本效益的故障监测的鲁棒解决方案，并在边缘智能应用机器学习和处理复杂、大规模振动数据方面展示了有效的信号处理策略。

Abstract: Bearing fault diagnosis in rotating machinery is critical for ensuring
operational reliability, therefore early fault detection is essential to avoid
catastrophic failures and expensive emergency repairs. Traditional methods like
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) often fail to capture the complex, non-stationary
nature of vibration signals. This study leverages the cyclostationary
properties of vibration data through Spectral Correlation Density (SCD) images
to enhance fault detection and apply deep learning for classification. Using a
publicly available dataset with bearing faults seeded in two distinct housings
(A and B) under varying load conditions (0 Nm, 2 Nm, 4 Nm), we processed
vibration signals into 2D SCD images to reveal fault-specific periodicities,
such as broadband spectra (2000--8000 Hz) for larger faults. Three
convolutional neural network (CNN) models, Custom CNN, ResNet152V2, and
EfficientNetB0, were developed to classify seven bearing conditions. The custom
CNN achieved the highest accuracies of 96.58\% and 94.95\% on Housing A and B,
respectively, followed by ResNet152V2 at 96.49\% and 95.35\%, and
EfficientNetB0 at 94.16\% and 91.65\%, respectively. The models' high
accuracies across different housings demonstrate a robust solution suitable for
cost-effective condition monitoring deployable near sensing platforms,
contributing to applied machine learning for edge intelligence and showcasing
effective signal processing strategies for handling complex, potentially
large-scale vibration data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信号处理领域，子空间跟踪是一个基本问题，其目标是估计和跟踪随时间变化的观测数据流所跨越的底层子空间。在高维设置中，数据样本经常受到非高斯噪声的干扰，并可能表现出稀疏性。因此，有必要开发能够应对这些挑战的鲁棒子空间估计和跟踪方法。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的基于 alpha 散度的稀疏子空间估计和跟踪方法，在处理存在非高斯噪声和稀疏性的数据时，展现了优越的鲁棒性，并且在计算效率方面也表现出色，为信号处理领域提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Subspace tracking is a fundamental problem in signal processing, where the
goal is to estimate and track the underlying subspace that spans a sequence of
data streams over time. In high-dimensional settings, data samples are often
corrupted by non-Gaussian noises and may exhibit sparsity. This paper explores
the alpha divergence for sparse subspace estimation and tracking, offering
robustness to data corruption. The proposed method outperforms the
state-of-the-art robust subspace tracking methods while achieving a low
computational complexity and memory storage. Several experiments are conducted
to demonstrate its effectiveness in robust subspace tracking and
direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: AFDM可以实现通信和信道探测的集成，解决了传统方法在动态变化的信道模型中的不足，并为下一代通信网络提供了新的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信道探测系统无法满足下一代空天地海一体化网络（SAGSIN）中动态变化的信道模型需求，导致信道模型过时，无法为通信系统提供可靠的先验信息。

Method: 提出了一种集成信道探测与通信（ICSC）的方法，利用仿射频分复用（AFDM）技术，它提供完整的时延-多普勒信道表示，在时频双重时变信道中实现最优分集，从而解决上述挑战。

Conclusion: 讨论了实现AFDM-ICSC的关键挑战，概述了未来的研究方向，并为该技术的持续发展提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Channel models are crucial for theoretical analysis, performance evaluation,
and deployment of wireless communication systems. Traditional channel sounding
systems are insufficient for handling the dynamic changes of channels in the
next-generation space-air-ground-sea integrated networks (SAGSIN), which often
results in outdated channel models that fail to provide reliable prior
information for communication systems. To address this challenge, this paper
proposes an integrated channel sounding and communication (ICSC) method as a
practical solution. Unlike orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, affine
frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) provides a full delay-Doppler
representation of the channel, achieving optimal diversity in time-frequency
doubly dispersive channels and effectively addressing the aforementioned
challenges. Thus, we investigate the fundamental principles of AFDM, showing
how it enables simultaneous communication and channel sounding, and explore key
performance metrics for both functionalities. We also clarify the distinction
and relationship between channel sounding, estimation, tracking and scatterer
sensing. Additionally, several potential application scenarios for AFDM-ICSC
are explored. Finally, we highlight the key challenges in implementing
AFDM-ICSC, outline future research directions, and provide valuable insights
for the continued development of this technology.

Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) enable high spatial resolution
and multiplexing, especially for user equipments (UEs) in the radiative
near-field. To reduce hardware cost, modular ELAA architectures with
distributed baseband units (BBUs) are gaining traction. This paper addresses
near-field line-of-sight (LOS) channel estimation under low noise amplifier
(LNA)-induced hardware impairments in such modular systems. We propose
computationally efficient estimators that exploit the array geometry and
constant-modulus structure of near-field LOS channels, including a novel
two-dimensional (2D) discrete Fourier transform (DFT) masking technique that
improves estimation accuracy and significantly reduces fronthaul signaling.
Numerical results show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the
conventional least squares (LS) method.

Conclusion: iZoSGA算法是一种有效的数据驱动学习算法，能够处理复杂的IRS辅助无线网络中的联合波束成形和预编码问题，即使在不精确的优化条件下也能实现良好的性能。

Abstract: We propose iZoSGA, a data-driven learning algorithm for joint passive
long-term intelligent reflective surface (IRS)-aided beamforming and active
short-term precoding in wireless networks. iZoSGA is based on a zeroth-order
stochastic quasigradient ascent methodology designed for tackling two-stage
nonconvex stochastic programs with continuous uncertainty and objective
functions with "black-box" terms, and where second-stage optimization is
inexact. As such, iZoSGA utilizes inexact precoding oracles, enabling practical
implementation when short-term (e.g., WMMSE-based) beamforming is solved
approximately. The proposed method is agnostic to channel models or statistics,
and applies to arbitrary IRS/network configurations. We prove non-asymptotic
convergence of iZoSGA to a neighborhood of a stationary solution of the
original exact problem under minimal assumptions. Our numerics confirm the
efficacy iZoSGA in several "inexact regimes", enabling passive yet fully
effective IRS operation in diverse and realistic IRS-aided scenarios.

Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems have recently gained significant attention as a
novel reconfigurable-antenna technology due to its exceptional capability of
mitigating signal-propagation path loss. In this letter, we investigate the
secrecy performance of a pinching-antenna system in the presence of an
eavesdropper. In particular, we derive an approximate expression of the

of the legitimate user and eavesdropper and analyze its asymptotic behavior.
Moreover, we derive a constant performance lower bound on the SOP of the
considered system, i.e., $\frac{2\pi-1}{24}$, which is significantly lower than
that of conventional fixed-position antenna systems, i.e., $0.5$. Finally,
simulation results are provided to validate the correctness of our analytical

### [12] [Graph Fractional Hilbert Transform: Theory and Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16910)
*Daxiang Li,Zhichao Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 图分数阶希尔伯特变换（GFRHT）通过引入双参数（分数阶数α和角度参数β）来扩展图傅里叶变换（GHT）的功能，解决了GHT在相位刚性和信息损失方面的问题，并在图信号处理任务中表现出优于GHT的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图希尔伯特变换（GHT）在图信号处理中存在局限性，例如其效用受限于图傅里叶域、相位移动固定、实值谱分量存在信息丢失以及缺乏可调参数。虽然图分数阶傅里叶变换引入了分数阶数参数α来提高域的灵活性，但未能解决相位刚性和信息丢失的问题。

Method: 提出图分数阶希尔伯特变换（GFRHT），该变换借鉴了经典信号处理中的双参数分数阶希尔伯特变换（FRHT）。GFRHT采用双参数框架：分数阶数α实现了跨任意分数域的分析，并在顶点和谱空间之间进行插值；角度参数β则提供了可调的相位移动，并为实数特征值提供了非零的实值响应（cosβ），从而消除了信息丢失。在此基础上，GFRHT被形式化定义，其核心性质得到确立，并设计了一种用于构建图解析信号的方法，以实现精确的包络提取和解调。

Result: 通过在边缘检测、异常识别和语音分类等任务上进行实验，证明了GFRHT相较于GHT具有更好的灵活性和更优越的性能。

Conclusion: GFRHT通过引入双参数α和β，有效解决了GHT在相位调整和信息丢失方面的问题，为图信号处理提供了更强大的工具，并在实际应用中取得了优于GHT的性能。

Abstract: The graph Hilbert transform (GHT) is a key tool in constructing analytic
signals and extracting envelope and phase information in graph signal
processing. However, its utility is limited by confinement to the graph Fourier
domain, a fixed phase shift, information loss for real-valued spectral
components, and the absence of tunable parameters. The graph fractional Fourier
transform introduces domain flexibility through a fractional order parameter
$\alpha$ but does not resolve the issues of phase rigidity and information
loss. Inspired by the dual-parameter fractional Hilbert transform (FRHT) in
classical signal processing, we propose the graph FRHT (GFRHT). The GFRHT
incorporates a dual-parameter framework: the fractional order $\alpha$ enables
analysis across arbitrary fractional domains, interpolating between vertex and
spectral spaces, while the angle parameter $\beta$ provides adjustable phase
shifts and a non-zero real-valued response ($\cos\beta$) for real eigenvalues,
thereby eliminating information loss. We formally define the GFRHT, establish
its core properties, and design a method for graph analytic signal
construction, enabling precise envelope extraction and demodulation.
Experiments on edge detection, anomaly identification, and speech
classification demonstrate that GFRHT outperforms GHT, offering greater
flexibility and superior performance in graph signal processing.

*Huong Hoang,Keito Suzuki,Truong Nguyen,Pamela Cosman*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 通过融合语义分割和区域特定变换模型，提出了一种新的双模态编码框架，以提高动态人体运动序列的压缩效率，尤其是在快速运动或强非刚性变形的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始的基于关键节点的编码器在处理快速运动或强非刚性形变的动态人体运动序列时，在压缩效率方面存在不足。

Method: 提出了一种新的双模态编码框架，该框架通过整合语义分割和区域特定变换模型来增强运动表示的灵活性。刚性变换模型（旋转和平移）通过混合方案进行扩展，该方案仅将仿射变换（旋转、平移、缩放和剪切）选择性地应用于形变丰富的区域（例如，躯干，松散的衣物会引起高变异性），同时在其他区域保留刚性模型。仿射模型被分解为最小参数集以进行有效编码，并通过由拉格朗日率失真优化指导的组件选择策略进行组合。

Result: 双模态方法实现了更精确的网格形变，尤其是在涉及复杂非刚性运动的序列中，同时在简单区域的压缩效率方面没有受到影响，与基线相比，平均比特率节省了33.81%。

Conclusion: 所提出的双模态编码框架通过针对不同区域的运动特性采用不同的变换模型，显著提高了动态人体运动序列的表示精度和压缩效率，尤其是在处理复杂非刚性运动时。

Abstract: For dynamic human motion sequences, the original KeyNode-Driven codec often
struggles to retain compression efficiency when confronted with rapid movements
or strong non-rigid deformations. This paper proposes a novel Bi-modal coding
framework that enhances the flexibility of motion representation by integrating
semantic segmentation and region-specific transformation modeling. The rigid
transformation model (rotation & translation) is extended with a hybrid scheme
that selectively applies affine transformations-rotation, translation, scaling,
and shearing-only to deformation-rich regions (e.g., the torso, where loose
clothing induces high variability), while retaining rigid models elsewhere. The
affine model is decomposed into minimal parameter sets for efficient coding and
combined through a component selection strategy guided by a Lagrangian
Rate-Distortion optimization. The results show that the Bi-modal method
achieves more accurate mesh deformation, especially in sequences involving
complex non-rigid motion, without compromising compression efficiency in
simpler regions, with an average bit-rate saving of 33.81% compared to the
baseline.

Method: 使用泊松点过程（PPP）对地面用户进行建模，并采用固定波束预编码，推导出速率与天线数量、用户密度和组播用户数之间关系的渐近比率缩放律的闭式表达式。

Result: 推导出的解析表达式表明，通过相应地增加用户密度，可以精确地补偿由组播传输引起的速率下降。

Conclusion: 在GEO卫星通信的大规模MIMO组播系统中，速率退化可以通过增加用户密度来补偿。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a geostationary orbit (GEO) satellite
communication system that employs massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
for multicast transmission. By modeling the spatial distribution of ground
users using a Poisson point process (PPP) and assuming a fixed-beam precoding
is adopted, we find a closed-form expression for the asymptotical rate scaling
law as a function of the number of antennas and the scaling factors of user
density and multicast users. From the derived analytical expression, we reveal
that the rate degradation caused by multicast transmission can be precisely
compensated by increasing the user density accordingly.

Motivation: 提出了一种用于连续孔径阵列（CAPA）的多用户MIMO（MU-MIMO）系统的下行波束成形加权最小均方误差（WMMSE）算法的函数扩展。

Method: 将经典离散WMMSE递归中的矩阵和向量提升为连续函数，用孔径上的积分替换矩阵乘积和内积。通过Galerkin投影将函数映射到系数矩阵，通过封闭形式更新解决离散WMMSE问题，然后将这些更新映射回函数域。使用Gauss-Legendre进行积分，并通过加权矩阵乘积保持封闭形式结构。

Conclusion: 在MU-MIMO系统中，连续孔径阵列的WMMSE算法的函数扩展在性能和效率方面都优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a functional extension of the weighted minimum
mean-squared error (WMMSE) algorithm for downlink beamforming in multiuser
multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems where both the base station
(BS) and the users employ continuous-aperture arrays (CAPAs). The method lifts
the matrices and vectors in the classical discrete WMMSE recursion to
continuous functions by replacing matrix products and inner products with
integrals over the apertures. In practice, we apply a Galerkin projection to
map functions to coefficient matrices, solve the resulting discrete WMMSE
problem via closed-form updates, and then lift these updates back to the
functional domain. All integrals are implemented using Gauss-Legendre
quadrature, which preserves the closed-form structure through weighted matrix
products. Simulations show that the proposed method outperforms baselines in
both spectral efficiency (SE) and computational complexity.

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a transformative
technology in wireless communication, enabling dynamic control over signal
propagation. This paper tackles the challenge of mitigating Channel State
Information (CSI) perturbations in RIS-aided systems, particularly for secure
communication scenarios. Leveraging a first-order approximation technique, we
develop a robust approach that strengthens the resilience of RIS configurations
against CSI imperfections. The study considers both untrusted user interception
and stealth radar applications, focusing on optimizing signal reflection and
transmission in the presence of eavesdroppers. Simulation results demonstrate
notable gains in security and efficiency while maintaining low computational
complexity. By extending the stability range, the proposed method updates RIS
elements using only a few matrix-vector multiplications, eliminating the need
for repeated inverse or pseudo-inverse computations under small channel
perturbations. Additionally, the framework provides a baseline for quantifying
algorithmic sensitivity to CSI variations. Overall, the findings underscore the
potential of RIS to enable secure and reliable communication in next-generation
networks such as 6G.

Abstract: Potatoes are an economically important crop, and their quality is closely
related to the starch content, which is typically inferred from specific
gravity (SG). Although microwave sensing technologies have been increasingly
developed for underground potato detection and quality assessment in recent
years, no accurate model has yet been established to link the dielectric
properties of potatoes with their key agronomic traits. To address this gap, we
developed a model for estimating potato tubers' SG based on their dielectric
constant. To construct and validate the model, we conducted SG measurements and
dielectric spectroscopy measurements in the frequency range of 0.3 GHz to 3.0
GHz on 250 potatoes of five different types (red, russet, yellow, purple, and
chipping potatoes, with 50 samples per type). Out of the 250 data sets, 200
data sets were used for model development, and 50 data sets were used for model
validation. A linear regression model was used to summarize the relationship
between SG and dielectric constant, where the regression coefficients are
expressed as fourth-order polynomial functions of frequency. Experimental
results on the 50 validation data sets show that the model achieves high
estimation accuracy with mean absolute errors (MAE) less than
\(4.8\times10^{-3}\) and mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) less than
0.45\%. The study of the dielectric properties of potatoes, along with the
derived SG estimation model, provides a foundation for the future development
of microwave sensing technologies for agronomic trait assessment in the potato
production and processing industries. All measured data will be made publicly
available upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is a promising candidate measure for the assessment
and optimization of localization systems, as it captures nonlinear dependencies
between random variables. However, the high cost of computing MI, especially
for high-dimensional problems, prohibits its application for many real-world
localization systems. We evaluate an algorithm from a new class of neural MI
estimators called Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE) to approximate
the MI between the set of feasible user element (UE) locations and the
corresponding set of measurements from said UE locations used for positioning.
We apply this estimator to a simulated multilateration (MLAT) system, where the
true MI for benchmarking can be approximated by Monte Carlo simulation. The
estimator is experimentally evaluated w.r.t. its convergence and consistency
and we investigate the usefulness of MI for assessing simple MLAT systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the design of the capacity-achieving input
distribution for the discrete-time Poisson channel (DTPC) under dark current
effects with low-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). This study
introduces an efficient optimization algorithm that integrates the
Newton-Raphson and Blahut-Arimoto (BA) methods to determine the
capacity-achieving input distribution and the corresponding amplitudes of input
mass points for the DTPC, subject to both peak and average power constraints.
Additionally, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are established to
provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of the obtained
capacity-achieving distribution. Simulation results illustrate that the
proposed algorithm attains $72\%$ and $83\%$ of the theoretical capacity at 5
dB for 1-bit and 2-bit quantized DTPC, respectively. Furthermore, for a
finite-precision quantized DTPC (i.e., ${\log _2}K$ bits), the capacity can be
achieved by a non-uniform discrete input distribution with support for $K$ mass
points, under the given power constraints.

Abstract: This paper investigates single-snapshot direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation
and target localization with coherent sparse extremely large aperture arrays
(ELAAs) in automotive radar applications. Far-field and near-field signal
models are formulated for distributed bistatic configurations. To enable
noncoherent processing, a single-snapshot MUSIC (SS-MUSIC) algorithm is
proposed to fuse local spectra from individual subarrays and extended to
near-field localization via geometric intersection. For coherent processing, a
single-snapshot ESPRIT (SS-ESPRIT) method with ambiguity dealiasing is
developed to fully exploit the aperture of sparse ELAAs for high-resolution
angle estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that SS-ESPRIT provides
superior angular resolution for closely spaced far-field targets, while
SS-MUSIC offers robustness in near-field localization and flexibility in hybrid
scenarios.

Abstract: Purpose: Chest X-rays are essential for diagnosing pulmonary conditions, but
limited access in resource-constrained settings can delay timely diagnosis.
Electrocardiograms (ECGs), in contrast, are widely available, non-invasive, and
often acquired earlier in clinical workflows. This study aims to assess whether
ECG features and patient demographics can predict chest radiograph findings
using an interpretable machine learning approach.
  Methods: Using the MIMIC-IV database, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
classifiers were trained to predict diverse chest radiograph findings from
ECG-derived features and demographic variables. Recursive feature elimination
was performed independently for each target to identify the most predictive
features. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUROC) with bootstrapped 95% confidence
intervals. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were applied to interpret
feature contributions.
  Results: Models successfully predicted multiple chest radiograph findings
with varying accuracy. Feature selection tailored predictors to each target,
and including demographic variables consistently improved performance. SHAP
analysis revealed clinically meaningful contributions from ECG features to
radiographic predictions.
  Conclusion: ECG-derived features combined with patient demographics can serve
as a proxy for certain chest radiograph findings, enabling early triage or
pre-screening in settings where radiographic imaging is limited. Interpretable
machine learning demonstrates potential to support radiology workflows and
improve patient care.

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) signify a pivotal advancement in 6G communication
by enhancing spectral efficiency and robustness. However, obtaining accurate
channel state information (CSI) in FAS poses challenges due to its complex
physical structure. Traditional methods, such as pilot-based interpolation and
compressive sensing, are not only computationally intensive but also lack
adaptability. Current extrapolation techniques relying on rigid parametric
models do not accommodate the dynamic environment of FAS, while data-driven
deep learning approaches demand extensive training and are vulnerable to noise
and hardware imperfections. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
a novel self-supervised learning network (SSNet) designed for efficient and
adaptive channel extrapolation in FAS. We formulate the problem of channel
extrapolation in FAS as an image reconstruction task. Here, a limited number of
unmasked pixels (representing the known CSI of the selected ports) are used to
extrapolate the masked pixels (the CSI of unselected ports). SSNet capitalizes
on the intrinsic structure of FAS channels, learning generalized
representations from raw CSI data, thus reducing dependency on large labelled
datasets. For enhanced feature extraction and noise resilience, we propose a
mix-of-expert (MoE) module. In this setup, multiple feedforward neural networks
(FFNs) operate in parallel. The outputs of the MoE module are combined using a
weighted sum, determined by a gating function that computes the weights of each
FFN using a softmax function. Extensive simulations validate the superiority of
the proposed model. Results indicate that SSNet significantly outperforms
benchmark models, such as AGMAE and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks by
using a much smaller labelled dataset.

Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), which enables
advanced wave control through interconnection of RIS elements, are gaining
growing recognition as a promising technology for 6G and beyond. However, the
enhanced flexibility of BD-RIS in controlling the phase and amplitude of
reflected signals comes at the cost of high circuit complexity. In this paper,
we propose two novel BD-RIS architectures, namely, the stem-connected RIS and
cluster-connected RIS, to explore trade-off between circuit complexity and
performance. Specifically, the proposed stem-connected RIS is capable of
achieving the same performance as fully-connected RIS while significantly
reducing circuit complexity. The proposed cluster-connected RIS offers a
unified framework that generalizes existing BD-RIS architectures--including
single-connected, fully-connected, group-connected, tree-connected (arrowhead),
and forest-connected (arrowhead) RISs--as special cases. This framework enables
a much more flexible trade-offs between circuit complexity and system
performance than existing ones. Based on the proposed BD-RIS architectures, we
introduce a novel and generalized structure-oriented symmetric unitary
projection method for designing the scattering matrix across all BD-RIS
configurations. This method is effectively applied to solve the sum channel
gain maximization problem and other utility-based optimization problems.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed stem-connected RIS is the
simplest architecture that achieves optimal BD-RIS performance, while the
cluster-connected RIS further enlarges the performance-complexity trade-off
range. Furthermore, the proposed projection-based algorithms demonstrate high
efficiency.

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint optimization of pilot subcarrier allocation and
non-orthogonal sequence for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)-orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems under compressed sensing
(CS)-based channel estimation exploiting delay and angle sparsity. Since the
performance of CS-based approaches depends on a coherence metric of the sensing
matrix in the measurement process, we formulate a joint optimization problem to
minimize this coherence. Due to the discrete nature of subcarrier allocation, a
straightforward formulation of the joint optimization results in a
mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is computationally intractable
due to the combinatorial explosion of allocation candidates. To overcome the
intractability of discrete variables, we introduce a block sparse penalty for
pilots across all subcarriers, which ensures that the power of some unnecessary
pilots approaches zero. This framework enables joint optimization using only
continuous variables. In addition, we propose an efficient computation method
for the coherence metric by exploiting the structure of the sensing matrix,
which allows its gradient to be derived in closed form, making the joint
optimization problem solvable in an efficient way via a gradient descent
approach. Numerical results confirm that the proposed pilot sequence exhibits
superior coherence properties and enhances the CS-based channel estimation
performance.

We propose a generative model that integrates Autoregressive (AR)
parameterization into a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for modeling Wide-Sense
Stationary (WSS) processes. By exploiting model-based insights allowing for
structural constraints, the approach significantly reduces parameters while
maintaining high modeling accuracy. Channel estimation experiments show that
the model can outperform standard GMMs and variants using Toeplitz or circulant
covariances, particularly with small sample sizes. For larger datasets, it
matches the performance of conventional methods while improving computational
efficiency and reducing the memory requirements.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel integrated sensing and communications

environments. We first provide an excitation-bridge coupling model to represent
the micro-deformation process of the bridge. Next, we design a novel frame
structure for BMDM applications, and construct the OFDM echo channel model for
basic scene of BMDM, including micro-deformation, dynamic objects, and static
environment. Then, we develop a phasor statistical analysis method based on
average cancellation algorithm to suppress the interference of dynamic objects,
as well as a circle fitting method based on least squares algorithm to remove
the interference of static environment near the monitoring area. Furthermore,
we extract the micro-deformation feature vector from the OFDM echo signals
after inverse discrete fourier transform (IDFT), and derive vertical
micro-deformation value with the time-frequency phase resources. Simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BMDM scheme and its
robustness against both dynamic interferences and static interferences.
