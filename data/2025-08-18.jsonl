In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals\nwith actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven\ndecisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual\n(i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world\napplications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing\noutcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the\ninherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact\nand compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel\nframework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple\nrecourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction\nas a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided\nby both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse\ncosts, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap\nbetween individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a\nthree-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal\ncapacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware\noptimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs.\nExperimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that\nour framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve\nnear-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings.

More specifically, we study\ntwo prominent alternatives to the standard notion of admissibility from\nabstract argumentation, namely strong and weak admissibility, and introduce the\nrespective preferred, complete and grounded semantics for general (sometimes\ncalled non-flat) ABA. To do so, we use abstract bipolar set-based argumentation\nframeworks (BSAFs) as formal playground since they concisely capture the\nrelations between assumptions and are expressive enough to represent general\nnon-flat ABA frameworks, as recently shown. While weak admissibility has been\nrecently investigated for a restricted fragment of ABA in which assumptions\ncannot be derived (flat ABA), strong admissibility has not been investigated\nfor ABA so far. We introduce strong admissibility for ABA and investigate\ndesirable properties. We furthermore extend the recent investigations of weak\nadmissibility in the flat ABA fragment to the non-flat case. We show that the\ncentral modularization property is maintained under classical, strong, and weak\nadmissibility. We also show that strong and weakly admissible semantics in\nnon-flat ABA share some of the shortcomings of standard admissible semantics\nand discuss ways to address these."}

We provide a systematic analysis\nof the failures of both open-source and commercial models, examining the\neffects of search space size, as well as the benefits of scaling model size in\nour setting. Our analysis identifies key challenges for current generative\nmodels as well as promising directions for future work."}

For robust model ranking, we employ the\nBradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches,\na cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated\nmodels, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that\nprioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize\ninformation gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and\nsimulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable\nrankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced\ndatasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation.

However, current methods are often computationally\nexpensive and data-intensive, as they require constructing an uncertainty model\nbefore calibration. Moreover, existing approaches typically represent the\nprediction sets with intervals, which limits their ability to capture\ndependencies in multi-dimensional outputs. We address these limitations by\nintroducing zono-conformal prediction, a novel approach inspired by interval\npredictor models and reachset-conformant identification that constructs\nprediction zonotopes with assured coverage. By placing zonotopic uncertainty\nsets directly into the model of the base predictor, zono-conformal predictors\ncan be identified via a single, data-efficient linear program. While we can\napply zono-conformal prediction to arbitrary nonlinear base predictors, we\nfocus on feed-forward neural networks in this work.

However, due to the parameter explosion and data\nsparsity issues, Bayesian network classifiers are restricted to low-order\nfeature dependency modeling, making them struggle in extrapolating the\noccurrence probabilities of complex real-world data. In this paper, we propose\na novel paradigm to design high-order Bayesian network classifiers, by learning\ndistributional representations for feature values, as what has been done in\nword embedding and graph representation learning. The learned distributional\nrepresentations are encoded with the semantic relatedness between different\nfeatures through their observed co-occurrence patterns in training data, which\nthen serve as a hallmark to extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of new\ntest samples. As a classifier design realization, we remake the K-dependence\nBayesian classifier (KDB) by extending it into a neural version, i.e.,\nNeuralKDB, where a novel neural network architecture is designed to learn\ndistributional representations of feature values and parameterize the\nconditional probabilities between interdependent features. A stochastic\ngradient descent based algorithm is designed to train the NeuralKDB model\nefficiently. Extensive classification experiments on 60 UCI datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed NeuralKDB classifier excels in capturing\nhigh-order feature dependencies and significantly outperforms the conventional\nBayesian network classifiers, as well as other competitive classifiers,\nincluding two neural network based classifiers without distributional\nrepresentation learning."}

We address these limitations by\nintroducing zono-conformal prediction, a novel approach inspired by interval\npredictor models and reachset-conformant identification that constructs\nprediction zonotopes with assured coverage. By placing zonotopic uncertainty\nsets directly into the model of the base predictor, zono-conformal predictors\ncan be identified via a single, data-efficient linear program.

On\npsychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower\nexplicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose\nto save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that\nLLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities\nwere equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described\nas more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human.

Additionally, we employ a tree-structured memory in which the root\nnode encodes the user's basic information, while child nodes (e.g., topic and\nstatement) organize key information according to distinct symptom categories\nand interaction turns. This memory is dynamically updated throughout the\ninteraction to reduce redundant questioning and further enhance the information\nextraction and contextual tracking capabilities. Experimental results on the\nDAIC-WOZ dataset illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which\nachieves better performance than existing approaches."}

It delivers up to 7.7x faster training than open web\ndata and 2.7x faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, a 3B model trained for\n180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token\nbudget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on\nsynthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to\nrephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality.\nOverall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating\nhigh-quality synthetic pretraining data. The best outcomes require jointly\noptimizing many factors, a challenging task that requires rigorous science and\npractical expertise. Naive approaches can yield modest improvements,\npotentially at great cost, while well-executed methods can yield transformative\nimprovements, as exemplified by BeyondWeb."}
