However, manual or semi-manual entry of\nstructured item specifics often produces inconsistent quality, errors, and slow\nturnaround, especially for Customer-to-Customer sellers. Generating accurate\ndescriptions directly from item images offers a promising alternative. Existing\nretrieval-based solutions address some of these issues but often miss\nfine-grained visual details and struggle with niche or specialized categories.\n  We propose Optimized Preference-Based AI for Listings (OPAL), a framework for\ngenerating schema-compliant, high-quality item descriptions from images using a\nfine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM). OPAL addresses key\nchallenges in multimodal e-commerce applications, including bridging modality\ngaps and capturing detailed contextual information. It introduces two data\nrefinement methods: MLLM-Assisted Conformity Enhancement, which ensures\nalignment with structured schema requirements, and LLM-Assisted Contextual\nUnderstanding, which improves the capture of nuanced and fine-grained\ninformation from visual inputs.\n  OPAL uses visual instruction tuning combined with direct preference\noptimization to fine-tune the MLLM, reducing hallucinations and improving\nrobustness across different backbone architectures. We evaluate OPAL on\nreal-world e-commerce datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms\nbaseline methods in both description quality and schema completion rates. These\nresults demonstrate that OPAL effectively bridges the gap between visual and\ntextual modalities, delivering richer, more accurate, and more consistent item\ndescriptions. This work advances automated listing optimization and supports\nscalable, high-quality content generation in e-commerce platforms."}

Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy\ncompared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive,\nreward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable,\nhigh-performance language model adaptation."}

This study\nutilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for\nseamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and\nexplains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special\nemphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data,\nincluding the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing\ntechniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various\nhyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths\nfor activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the\nbest performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the\ntraining set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency,\nExplainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature\nimportance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed\ncomparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of\nselected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models\nfor sustainable livestock management."}

However,\nreal-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of\nrarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully\ncapture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on\nlongitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical\nperformance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,\nlargely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address\nthese issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for\nRobust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two\ncomplementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated\nmedical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from\nreal-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which\nnaturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer\nthrough shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.\nTo further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse\nregularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing\nspurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model\nachieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and\nmaintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive\nexperiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience\nto unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned\nsparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings."}

Although CP provides\nstatistically rigorous marginal coverage guarantees for prediction sets, and\nsignificance testing offers established statistical rigor, their synergistic\nintegration remains unexplored. To mitigate hallucination and factual\ninaccuracies, our framework integrates $p$-value computation with conformity\nscoring through self-consistency resampling of MCQA responses.

Given the\nrapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients\nto quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon\npast experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced\nInitialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and\ncross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations\nfor learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering\nprocess at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the\noptimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and\nwithin each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer\nfor each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and\nintra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that\ncollaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and\noptimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.\nExtensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,\nincluding dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's\nadvantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is\ncritically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data\ndistributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A\nparticularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the\nglobal model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying\nrare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a\nminority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,\nhindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this\nchallenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the\nproblem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a\nhierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local\ngenerator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide\ntailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a\ndedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual\ninformation-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.\nBy calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism\ncorrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of\nmutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,\nminority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world\ndatasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\nGraphFedMIG compared with other baselines."}

A key obstacle lies in the complexity\nand variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often\nappear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting\ndetails. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core\nproblem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that\nunderstanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,\nparticularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a\nnew framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural\nlanguage problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet\nexpressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized\ninputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce\nDURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a\nthree-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems\nvia reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through\nself-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space.

Existing defenses, including host\nbased patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited\nscalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with\nembedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch\nvalidation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning\nFrom Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nautonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.\nREFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven\nby online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN\nguarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways\n(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real\nnetwork traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training\nLLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability\nfixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging\ncurrent LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that\ntranslates language context (vulnerability description) into network\nenforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the\nOnline Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22\nfamilies of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1\npercent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of\n3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices).

Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of\ngradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been\ndiscovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input\nperturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation\nhyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to\ninconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed\nformalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)\nan aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our\ntheoretical results through quantitative evaluations."}

With the rapid development of graph neural networks\n(GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements.\nHowever, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed,\nGNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data,\npotentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on\ndeveloping fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where\nmodels often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based\nstructures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection.\nTo address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose\n\\textbf{D}is\\textbf{E}ntangled \\textbf{C}ounterfactual \\textbf{A}dversarial\n\\textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving\nGAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to\ndisentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this\ncausal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along\nwith a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only\nachieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly\nenhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods.

However,\nreal-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of\nrarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully\ncapture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on\nlongitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical\nperformance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,\nlargely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address\nthese issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for\nRobust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two\ncomplementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated\nmedical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from\nreal-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which\nnaturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer\nthrough shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.\nTo further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse\nregularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing\nspurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model\nachieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and\nmaintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive\nexperiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience\nto unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned\nsparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings."}

(2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a\ndataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual\nexpansion.

PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a\nmulti-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable\nprobabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical\ndata, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic\nsupernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet\nlayer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and\ndirectly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient\nfindings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding\nwhether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency.

Existing denoising strategies often overlook entity-aware modeling,\nsuffer from high computational overhead, or demand excessive hyperparameter\ntuning, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose CrossDenoise, a\nnovel and lightweight framework that addresses these challenges by\ndisentangling noise estimation into user-, item-, and interaction-specific\nfactors. Leveraging empirical observations that show significant heterogeneity\nin user and item noise propensities, CrossDenoise computes entity reputation\nfactors (user/item reliability) via a rank-based linear mapping of average\ntraining losses. These are fused with interaction-level weights derived from an\nempirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of individual losses. This\ndesign is model-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only two\nintuitive hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on ML-1M, Yelp, and\nAmazon-book datasets, across GMF, NeuMF, and CDAE backbones, demonstrate that\nCrossDenoise consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines.
