However, existing vision-based frameworks often rely\non computationally intensive models and are also sensitive to environmental\ninterference. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, physics-guided\nand light-weighted framework that predicts the received signal strength\nindicator (RSSI) from camera images. By decomposing RSSI into its physically\ninterpretable components, path loss and shadow fading, we significantly reduce\nthe model's learning difficulty and exhibit interpretability. Our approach\nestablishes a new state-of-the-art by demonstrating exceptional robustness to\nenvironmental interference, a critical flaw in prior work. Quantitatively, our\nmodel reduces the prediction root mean squared error (RMSE) by 50.3% under\nconventional conditions and still achieves an 11.5% lower RMSE than the\nprevious benchmark's interference-eliminated results. This superior performance\nis achieved with a remarkably lightweight framework, utilizing a\nMobileNet-based model up to 19 times smaller than competing solutions. The\ncombination of high accuracy, robustness to interference, and computational\nefficiency makes our framework highly suitable for real-time, on-device\ndeployment in edge devices, paving the way for more intelligent and reliable\nwireless communication systems."}

Inspired by arcing current curve and\nthe Fourier decomposition analysis, we create an adaptive activation function\nwith super-expressiveness, termed EAS, and a novel network architecture with\nbranch networks to help MFNN extract features with multiple frequencies. In our\nexperiments, eight advanced arc fault diagnosis models across an experimental\ndataset with multiple sampling times and multi-level noise are used to\ndemonstrate the superiority of MFNN. The corresponding experiments show: 1) The\nMFNN outperforms other models in arc fault location, befitting from signal\ndecomposition of branch networks. 2) The noise immunity of MFNN is much better\nthan that of other models, achieving 14.51% over LCNN and 16.3% over BLS in\ntest accuracy when SNR=-9. 3) EAS and the network architecture contribute to\nthe excellent performance of MFNN."}

We propose a diffusion-based channel inpainting framework that\nintegrates system-model knowledge at inference via a likelihood-gradient term,\nenabling a single trained model to adapt across mismatched conditions. On\nstandardized CDL channels, the score-based diffusion variant consistently\noutperforms a UNet score-model baseline and the one-step MAE under distribution\nshift, with improvements up to 14 dB NMSE in challenging settings (e.g.,\nLaplace noise, user interference), while retaining competitive accuracy under\nmatched conditions.

The training process of a deep neural\nnetwork is partitioned between devices and the AP, where a DT replica is\nactivated to replace UDs with insufficient local computation capabilities. We\nformulate a delay-optimal split learning problem, which optimizes five key\nvariables: layer partitioning points, DT assignment decisions, IRS phase shift\nmatrix, AP downlink power allocation, and DT frequency adjustment, aiming to\nminimize the overall end-to-end delay under communication and computation. The\nproposed optimization problem is a highly coupled non-convex mixed-integer\nproblem.

Unfortunately, classical high-resolution\ntechniques require multi-element arrays and extensive snapshot collection,\nwhile generic Machine Learning (ML) approaches often yield black-box models\nthat lack physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a\nSymbolic Regression (SR)-based ML framework.

First, we validate our approach in a\ncontrolled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of\nthe known $\\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5\ndegree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further\nreduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that\nlack physical insight.
