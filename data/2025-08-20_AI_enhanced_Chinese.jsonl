To address this gap, we propose CT-CRS (Consumer\nType-Enhanced Conversational Recommender System), a framework that integrates\nconsumer type modeling into dialogue recommendation. Based on consumer type\ntheory, we define four user categories--dependent, efficient, cautious, and\nexpert--derived from two dimensions: decision-making style (maximizers vs.\nsatisficers) and knowledge level (high vs. low). CT-CRS employs interaction\nhistories and fine-tunes the large language model to automatically infer user\ntypes in real time, avoiding reliance on static questionnaires. We incorporate\nuser types into state representation and design a type-adaptive policy that\ndynamically adjusts recommendation granularity, diversity, and attribute query\ncomplexity. To further optimize the dialogue policy, we adopt Inverse\nReinforcement Learning (IRL), enabling the agent to approximate expert-like\nstrategies conditioned on consumer type. Experiments on LastFM, Amazon-Book,\nand Yelp show that CTCRS improves recommendation success rate and reduces\ninteraction turns compared to strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that\nboth consumer type modeling and IRL contribute significantly to performance\ngains.

DGNPP consists of two\nkey modules: the Node Aggregation Layer and the Self Attentive Layer. The Node\nAggregation Layer captures topological structures to generate static\nrepresentation for users and items, while the Self Attentive Layer dynamically\nupdates embeddings over time. By incorporating both dynamic and static\nembeddings into the event intensity function and optimizing the model via\nmaximum likelihood estimation, DGNPP predicts events and occurrence time\neffectively.

To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel frequency-domain model, Mixture of User-adaptive Frequency FIlteriNg\n(MUFFIN), operating through two complementary modules.

Finally, by aggregating both modules, MUFFIN captures diverse\nuser behavioral patterns across the full frequency spectrum.

The current methods have achieved remarkable success with the\npowerful structure modeling capability of graph neural networks. However, these\nmethods are often hindered by sparse data in real-world scenarios. Although\ncontrastive learning and homography ( i.e., homogeneous graphs) are employed to\naddress the data sparsity challenge, existing methods still suffer two main\nlimitations: 1) Simple multi-modal feature contrasts fail to produce effective\nrepresentations, causing noisy modal-shared features and loss of valuable\ninformation in modal-unique features; 2) The lack of exploration of the\nhomograph relations between user interests and item co-occurrence results in\nincomplete mining of user-item interplay.\n  To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for\n\\textbf{R}\\textbf{E}fining multi-mod\\textbf{A}l cont\\textbf{R}astive learning\nand ho\\textbf{M}ography relations (\\textbf{REARM}).

To mine\nhomogeneous relationships effectively, we integrate a newly constructed user\ninterest graph and an item co-occurrence graph with the existing user\nco-occurrence and item semantic graphs for graph learning. The extensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of REARM\nto various state-of-the-art baselines.

We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional\nSTDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First,\nwe evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to\ntheir STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can\nreduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects\nused for training.

However,\nexisting systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity:\ndecisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not\nnecessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our\nwork aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching\n(comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative\napproach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task\nlike existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most\nconfident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process,\ncomatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the\nhuman decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale\nhuman subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach.\nThe results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch\noutperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic\nmatching on their own.

We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable\ndistance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint\nset is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we\npropose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that\npenalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.\nFor case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is\nnumerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This\napproach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex\nconstraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to\nconstrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show\nthat a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow\nbut with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is\nmore computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained\ngeneration, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve\nsignificant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target\ndistributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show\nhow our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator,\nusing queries to a hard-label black-box classifier.

While diversity-aware algorithms exist, they suffer from two major\nlimitations. First, they fail to account for normative diversity, which\nrequires fair access to a broad range of perspectives. Second, they typically\napply diversity late in the system's pipeline, after a lot of content has\nalready been filtered out. Both limitations confine their effectiveness and\nprevent them from promoting true normative diversity in news recommendations.\n  We propose Aspect-Aware Candidate Generation (A2CG) to address these\nlimitations. Our framework introduces diversity into the earliest pipeline\nstage and uses a configurable mechanism to align diversity with specific\ndemocratic goals. A2CG represents each news article using multiple aspects of\nperspectives (e.g., sentiment, political leaning, frame) and uses a Vector\nQuantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to create a discrete, multi-faceted\nrepresentation. A decoder-only model then learns user preferences over these\naspect codes. We then inject diversity directly by reversing the sign on some\nof the query vector's aspects during the candidate retrieval process, ensuring\na more diverse set of candidates.\n  Our method, evaluated on the MIND dataset, enables a flexible trade-off\nbetween personalization and diversity early in the recommendation pipeline.

Current\nstate-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,\nproducing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and\nhallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack\nthe flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for\nmodern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot\ntranslation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for\nneural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To\naddress this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework\nthat treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic\ncomponents rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated\nneural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,\nmulti-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical\ndecomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from\nboth successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL\nspecifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds\na causal knowledge base from execution traces.

Key findings demonstrate that\nthe LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects\noutliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming\nexact matching in SOZ localization.

This tendency is reinforced\nby preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction\nbut can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,\nsycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific\nquestion answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,\ndecision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this\nphenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by\nintroducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of\nsycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much\nuser-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates\nadversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading\nresistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to\nmaintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations\nacross open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic\ntendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size.

To\nsystematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation\nframework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)\ntheir knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify\ncorresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to\navoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical\nperformance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:\nwhile agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\\%$ pass rates), they\nfail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with\nperformance dropping by $>23\\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\\%$\npass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in\nspecialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling\nmodel capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety\nconcerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk\nverifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an\nabstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract\ndescriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks.

Enabling\nfine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is\nchallenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained\nsynchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous\ntime series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual\nsemantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and\nmulti-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges\nby introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),\nan autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series\nwith textual events to make subsequent forecasts.

While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform\non EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally\nstructured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid\nparadigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream\ndeep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's\nintrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of\nDL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework\ndesigned to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert\nattention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models\ntrained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise\nreasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to\neffectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the\npolicy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with\nclinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive\nexperiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the\nintrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also\nenhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen\nclinical domains.

While human\nevaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks\nscalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various\nautomatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with\nhuman-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.\nOver time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic\nsimilarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it\nseems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in\nstudies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This\npaper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the\nmethodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,\nvalidation methods, and correlations with human judgment.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer\nLearning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and\nstability in data-constrained environments.

Instead of generating random\nperturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the\nsource cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These\nare then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To\ndefine a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based\nencoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the\ncombined set based on their proximity to the target instance.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored\nfor building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation\ntestbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly\nbenchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target\nsingle buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically\nrely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven\napproaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies\nand intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance.\nMoreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model\nformats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse\ncontrol scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source\nplatform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building\nflexibility coordination, was developed in this study.

The sophisticated\nanalysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional\nand medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML\napproaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in\nhealthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these\nchallenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit\nemotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment\nAnalysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context\nlearning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data\nanalysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically\nencodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply\ndomain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive\ntraining. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are\ncompared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based\nmethods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs.

In this paper, we generalize the\nstandard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of\ntwo parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three\nexisting SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be\nunified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further\npropose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into\ndesigning the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class\nseparability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class\ninformation of the inputs.

Previous work proposed a framework consisting of\nthree steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the\ndomain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python\nprogram, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one\nstrategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the\nstrategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect\ngeneralized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in\nthe form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence\nallowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the\ngeneralized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase\nwith a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the\nobserved plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to\nproduce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on\n17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and\nnever deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans.

While mobile network servers have ample\ncomputational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy\nconstraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated\nLearning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared\nmodel by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it\nrequires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which\nneglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,\nand increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter\nsharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange\nmodel prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces\ncommunication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full\nmodel weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model\narchitectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may\nbe biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth\nlabels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate\nthese issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that\niteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning\nreliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label\ngeneration and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates\ndiverse knowledge.

The good news is that our findings are compatible with the\nLess is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level\nreasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,\nwe are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and\nAIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with\na majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,\nthe best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25.

In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits,\nenabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed\nnoises, have recently attracted significant attention\n\\citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}.\nHowever, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few\nexceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits\n(MABs) \\citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.\n  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed\nbandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the\nloss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus\nfunction, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm\nfor heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity\nassumption and achieves an $\\widetilde{O}(T^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}})$\nworst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\\widetilde{O}(\\log\nT)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework\nto the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed\nlinear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an\n$\\widetilde{O}(d^{\\frac{1}{2}}T^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the\nbest-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes.

We focus on the\nThompson Sampling (TS) algorithm, a Bayesian approach celebrated for its\nempirical performance and exploration efficiency, under the assumption of\nGaussian rewards with unknown parameters. Unlike conventional bandit objectives\nfocusing on maximizing cumulative reward, Sharpe ratio optimization instead\nintroduces an inherent tradeoff between achieving high returns and controlling\nrisk, demanding careful exploration of both mean and variance. Our theoretical\ncontributions include a novel regret decomposition specifically designed for\nthe Sharpe ratio, highlighting the role of information acquisition about the\nreward distribution in driving learning efficiency. Then, we establish\nfundamental performance limits for the proposed algorithm \\texttt{SRTS} in\nterms of an upper bound on regret.

Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address\nsuch vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected\nmalicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining.\nHowever, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative,\napplying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging\nbecause their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This\nwork presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently\nmitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within\nthe attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on\nclients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify\nwhich connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due\nto overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this\nby carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge\nthe most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while\npreserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial\nthreat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full\nknowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness,\nrobustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and\nNon-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it\nwith state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions.

Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice\ndue to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both\ntraining and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply\napplying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we\nrevisit DQL and identify its core limitations.

Specifically, OFQL reformulates\nDQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While\nconventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step\ngeneration, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates\ndirect, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for\nmulti-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster\nand more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL\nbenchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based\nbaselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time\ncompared to DQL."}

However, the nature of many\npractical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates\nrobust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges\narising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic\nadaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control\ndomains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted\noptimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling\nprocess of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical\nPolicies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical\ndistribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the\nsampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable\ndiscrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based\noptimization.

In these cases, preference feedback or expert\ndemonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both\ntogether are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale.\nWe develop a new framing for learning from human data, \\emph{reward-rational\npartial orderings over observations}, designed to be flexible and scalable.\nBased on this we introduce a practical algorithm, LEOPARD: Learning Estimated\nObjectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations. LEOPARD can learn from a\nbroad range of data, including negative demonstrations, to efficiently learn\nreward functions across a wide range of domains. We find that when a limited\namount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD\noutperforms existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, we use\nLEOPARD to investigate learning from many types of feedback compared to just a\nsingle one, and find that combining feedback types is often beneficial.", "AI": {"tldr": "LEOPARD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u548c\u6392\u540d\u793a\u8303\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u7528\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\u6216\u4e13\u5bb6\u793a\u8303\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\u6216\u96be\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u504f\u597d\u504f\u5e8f\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1LEOPARD\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "LEOPARD\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6709\u9650\u504f\u597d\u548c\u793a\u8303\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u53cd\u9988\u7c7b\u578b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u989d\u5916\u76ca\u5904\u3002", "conclusion": "LEOPARD\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u7684RL\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}
