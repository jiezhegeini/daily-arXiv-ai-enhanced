A digitized\ncorpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43\nrigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused\nbenchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class,\nand GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and\ntool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were\ncompared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3,\nand a county-centroid heuristic.\n  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km\n(median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest\nLLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70%\n(Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12\nkm) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the\nmedian LLM by 48.6%.

Semi-supervised\ndomain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,\nassuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but\nthe test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this\nstudy, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,\nMoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are\nhighly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts\nresulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,\ndomain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a\ndomain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.\nSubsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive\ncontrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final\nclassifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and\ndiscriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data\naugmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow\nbetween the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex\nrepresentations.

Additionally, concept drift creates\nsubstantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous\ncellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online\ncellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal\nfeature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve\nhigh-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios.\nConcretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the\ncoarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction\nhorizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture\ndetailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized\nrefinement of the established trend.

Unlike traditional recommendation methods, insights into the local\nquality of routes and comparisons between candidate routes are crucial for\nenhancing recommendation performance but often overlooked in previous studies.\nTo achieve these, we propose a novel model called Comprehensive Comparison\nNetwork (CCN). CCN not only uses query-level features (e.g. user features) and\nitem-level features (e.g. route features, item embedding) that are common in\ntraditional recommendations, but also introduces comparison-level features\nwhich describe the non-overlapping segments between different routes to capture\nthe local quality of routes. The key component Comprehensive Comparison Block\n(CCB) in CCN is designed to enable comparisons between routes. CCB includes a\nComprehensive Comparison Operator (CCO) and a multi-scenario MLP, which can\nupdate the representations of candidate routes based on a comprehensive\ncomparison. By stacking multiple CCBs, CCN can determine the final scores of\ncandidate routes and recommend the optimal one to the user. Additionally, since\nroutes directly affect the costs and risks experienced by users, the RR model\nmust be interpretable for online deployment. Therefore, we designed an\ninterpretable pair scoring network to achieve interpretability.

These profiles\nsummarize both topical interests and behavioral patterns, serving as compact,\ninterpretable representations of user preferences. Rather than prompting the\nLLM with raw data, we use these profiles to provide high-level, semantically\nrich context-enabling the LLM to reason more effectively about alignment\nbetween a user's interests and recommended episodes. This reduces input\ncomplexity and improves interpretability. The LLM is then prompted to deliver\nfine-grained pointwise and pairwise judgments based on the profile-episode\nmatch.

However, the lack of common benchmarks, including\ndatasets, code and comparison metrics, makes their evaluation and comparison\nhard. In that context, we propose an open-source benchmark that comprises\nsimulated datasets of various {\\gamma}-spectrometry settings, codes of\ndifferent analysis approaches and evaluation metrics. This allows us to compare\nthe state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing\napproach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1)\nspectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are\ndeformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation;\nand (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A\nlarge dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an\nexperimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple\nradionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,\nthe statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning\napproaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the\nperformance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when\nspectral signatures are not modeled correctly. Consequently, the full-spectrum\nstatistical approach is most effective with known or well-modeled spectral\nsignatures, while end-to-end machine learning is a good alternative when\nmeasurement conditions are uncertain for radionuclide identification.\nConcerning the quantification task, the statistical approach provides accurate\nestimates of radionuclide counting, while the machine learning methods deliver\nless satisfactory results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u51c6\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u4f46\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u654f\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u8c31\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u591a\u573a\u666f\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u8c31\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u53d8\u5f02\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u4e5f\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5df2\u77e5\u6216\u826f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7b7e\u540d\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u662f\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u5907\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing FL\nframeworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and\nthe growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers\nfrom high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with\nlarge models. Previous works combine split learning (SL) and hierarchical FL\n(HierFL) to reduce device-side computation and improve scalability, but this\nintroduces training complexity due to coordination across tiers. To address\nthese issues, we propose SHeRL-FL, which integrates SL and hierarchical model\naggregation and incorporates representation learning at intermediate layers. By\nallowing clients and edge servers to compute training objectives independently\nof the cloud, SHeRL-FL significantly reduces both coordination complexity and\ncommunication overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of\nSHeRL-FL, we performed experiments on image classification tasks using\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and HAM10000 with AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 in\nboth IID and non-IID settings.

In this approach, each clause - a\nlogical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is\ndisqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict\nrequirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve\ncompetitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine\n(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict. If\nsome literals in a clause fail, the remaining ones can still contribute to the\noverall vote with a proportionally reduced score. As a result, each clause\neffectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input,\nenabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed\nfuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory\nfootprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the\nIMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a\n50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. FPTM\ntrains up to 316x faster (45 seconds vs. 4 hours) and fits within 50 KB,\nenabling online learning on microcontrollers.

This\noptimization perspective has a direct consequence for the backward pass. We\nprove that the standard gradient computed via backpropagation is mathematically\nidentical to an advantage-based policy gradient, a variance-reduced update rule\nfrom reinforcement learning.

To address this\nproblem, we investigate record linking (RL) as link prediction, commonly\nstudied in graph-based machine learning, by framing it as a cross-document\ncoreference resolution (CDCR) task enhanced with natural language inference\n(NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS) by shifting it into the causal\ninference (CI). We adapt CDCR, traditionally applied in the news domain, into\nan RL model to operate at the passage level, similar to NLI and STS, while\naccommodating the process industry's specific text formats, which contain\nunstructured text and structured record attributes.

In recent years, researchers have made\nsignificant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for\nspatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,\ni.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,\nleading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies\nhave introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically\nfocus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),\nthereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban\nphenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network\nwith Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal\nprediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware\nSpatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph\nconvolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network\nto effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and\n(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both\nexpected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on\nfour real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York\nCity, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty\nquantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5%\nimprovement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification."}

We evaluate MiGrATe on three\nchallenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program\ninduction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it\nconsistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating\nthe potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without\nexternal supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "MiGrATe\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ed1\u7bb1\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MiGrATe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GRPO\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7fa4\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u8bcd\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MiGrATe\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u5916\u90e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u590d\u6742\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that\nenhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,\nimplicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is\nformed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,\ncapturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor\nfor knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed\nperiodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task\nconsistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation\nmechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and\npreserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM.

Due to the loss of\nsemantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant\nknowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of\nanonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two\nkey challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted\ninto retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous\nentities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric\nabstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies.

It supplements meaningful\nsemantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),\nthe second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into\nstructured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned\nwith the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.\nTo guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies\nstrictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three\ndatasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and\nprivacy-robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faARoG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5e7b\u60f3\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u9648\u65e7\u6216\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u79c1\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u65f6\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5bfc\u5411\u62bd\u8c61\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u533f\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u62bd\u8c61\u6210\u9ad8\u5c42\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aARoG\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ARoG\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u654f\u611f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684LLMs\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from a country\nbeing `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g., people\nfrom a country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for both safety\ninterventions and interpretability research.", "AI": {"tldr": "BiasGym\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u51cf\u8f7b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ecBiasInject\u548cBiasScope\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6ce8\u5165\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u6e90\u5934\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u662f\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u89c1\u6ce8\u5165\uff08BiasInject\uff09\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u8303\u56f4\u5206\u6790\uff08BiasScope\uff09\u4e24\u6b65\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9a\u5411\u51cf\u504f\u3002", "result": "BiasGym\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u548c\u865a\u6784\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BiasGym\u4e3a\u504f\u89c1\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u51cf\u8f7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u901a\u7528\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4fc3\u8fdb\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an\nLLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of\nclinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the\ntraining of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to\nensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute \"gold standard\"\nfor appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common\ntherapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective\ntriggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by\nthis, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for\nmistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as\nstandards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then\nconstructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes\nduring interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies\nmistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset,\nthe final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The\ndetailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments\ndemonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide\nhigh-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant\npotential for the therapist training scenario."}

Chi-Geometry generates\nsynthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological\ntraits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions\nand species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains\nexactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are\nlabeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a\ncohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict\nchirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable\nand less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the\ngraph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved\npredictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to\ngenerate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nGNN architectures. The conclusions of these benchmarking results guided our\ndesign of two new GNN architectures.

While\nnumerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation\nabilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations.

Each task requires agent to identify essential\ninformation from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step\nreasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation,\nwe propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation\nof long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration,\ntask generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates\nthat OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing\nmore accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts\ncompared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will\nserve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of\nLLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios. In addition, we release\nOdysseyBench and HomerAgents to foster research along this line.", "AI": {"tldr": "OdysseyBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u957f\u5468\u671f\u529e\u516c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7HomerAgents\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOdysseyBench\u4f5c\u4e3a\u957f\u6d41\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1HomerAgents\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "OdysseyBench\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u957f\u5468\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9759\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "OdysseyBench\u548cHomerAgents\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2dLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u957f\u6d41\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

To address this\nissue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal\nconsistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time\ndecoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select\nthe most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal\nConsistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a\nmeasure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward\nsignal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative\nTSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the\nCountdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we\nachieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and\n25.3% on Countdown, respectively.
