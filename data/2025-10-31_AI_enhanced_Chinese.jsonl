However, existing vision-based frameworks often rely\non computationally intensive models and are also sensitive to environmental\ninterference. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, physics-guided\nand light-weighted framework that predicts the received signal strength\nindicator (RSSI) from camera images. By decomposing RSSI into its physically\ninterpretable components, path loss and shadow fading, we significantly reduce\nthe model's learning difficulty and exhibit interpretability. Our approach\nestablishes a new state-of-the-art by demonstrating exceptional robustness to\nenvironmental interference, a critical flaw in prior work. Quantitatively, our\nmodel reduces the prediction root mean squared error (RMSE) by 50.3% under\nconventional conditions and still achieves an 11.5% lower RMSE than the\nprevious benchmark's interference-eliminated results. This superior performance\nis achieved with a remarkably lightweight framework, utilizing a\nMobileNet-based model up to 19 times smaller than competing solutions. The\ncombination of high accuracy, robustness to interference, and computational\nefficiency makes our framework highly suitable for real-time, on-device\ndeployment in edge devices, paving the way for more intelligent and reliable\nwireless communication systems."}

SABER\nachieves high accuracy while bridging the gap between opaque ML methods and\ninterpretable physics-driven estimators. First, we validate our approach in a\ncontrolled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of\nthe known $\\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5\ndegree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further\nreduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that\nlack physical insight. Then, we implement the same SR-learned inversions in a\nreal-world, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided indoor testbed.\nSABER and unconstrained SR models accurately recover the true AoA with\nnear-zero error. Finally, we benchmark SABER against the Cram\\'er-Rao Lower\nBounds (CRLBs). Our results demonstrate that SABER is an interpretable and\naccurate alternative to state-of-the-art and black-box ML-based methods for AoA\nestimation."}

In this\ncontext, the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is applied in its\nspecialized form for HMMs, namely the Baum Welch algorithm, which has been\nextensively employed in applications such as speech recognition. The objective\nof this work is to present pseudocode formulations for both the training and\ndecoding procedures of HMMs in a different scenario, where the available data\nconsist of multiple independent temporal sequences generated by the same model,\neach of relatively short duration, i.e., containing only a limited number of\nsamples.

This paper presents a statistically adaptive differential\nprotection scheme based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, implemented via a\nBartlett-corrected G-statistic computed on logarithm-transformed current\nmagnitudes. The method is a multivariate fault detection engine that employs\nthe Mahalanobis distance to distinguish healthy and faulty states, enabling\nrobust detection even in noisy environments. Detection thresholds are\nstatistically derived from a chi-squared distribution for precise control over\nthe false alarm rate. Upon detection, a lightweight classifier identifies the\nfault type by assessing per-phase G-statistics against dedicated thresholds,\nenhanced by a temporal persistence filter for security. Extensive simulations\non a modified CIGRE 14-bus microgrid show high efficacy: sub-cycle average\ndetection delays, high detection and classification accuracy across operating\nmodes, resilience to high-impedance faults up to 250 Ohms, tolerance to 10 ms\ncommunication delay, and noise levels down to a 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio.\nThese findings demonstrate a reproducible and computationally efficient\nsolution for next-generation AC microgrid protection."}

This fluctuation disrupts reliable acquisition and may result in\ndistortion or clipping. Modulo sampling is now a promising solution to this\nproblem, by folding signals instead of saturating them. Recovery of the\noriginal waveform from folded observations is a highly ill-posed problem. In\nthis work, we propose a method based on a graph neural network, referred to as\nGraphUnwrapNet, for the modulo recovery of EEG signals. Our core idea is to\nrepresent an EEG signal as an organized graph whose channels and temporal\nconnections establish underlying interdependence. One of our key contributions\nis in introducing a pre-estimation guided feature injection module to provide\ncoarse folding indicators that enhance stability during recovery at wrap\nboundaries. This design integrates structural information with folding priors\ninto an integrated framework. We performed comprehensive experiments on the\nSimultaneous Task EEG Workload (STEW) dataset. The results demonstrate\nconsistent enhancements over traditional optimization techniques and\ncompetitive accuracy relative to current deep learning models. Our findings\nemphasize the potential of graph-based methodology for robust modulo EEG\nrecovery."}
