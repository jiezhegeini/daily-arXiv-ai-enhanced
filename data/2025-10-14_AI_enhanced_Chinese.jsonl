IEEE Global Communications Conference (Globecom)\n  Workshops, 2025", "summary": "In this paper, we investigate a novel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\nradar system aided by phase shifter based polarization-reconfigurable antennas\n(PRAs). Specifically, a base station (BS) equipped with multiple PRAs at both\nthe transmitter and the receiver aims to sense the unknown and random angular\nlocation parameter of a point target via sending wireless signals and\nprocessing the received echo signals reflected by the target, where only prior\ndistribution information about the location parameter is available for\nexploitation. Firstly, we characterize the sensing performance of this novel\nPRA-based MIMO radar system by deriving the Bayesian Cram\\'er-Rao bound (BCRB)\nof the mean-squared error (MSE) in estimating the desired location parameter\nwith prior distribution information. Then, to fully exploit the new design\ndegrees-of-freedom (DoF) empowered by PRAs, we study the joint optimization of\nthe transmit sample covariance matrix as well as the transmit and receive phase\nshift vectors to minimize the sensing BCRB subject to a transmit power\nconstraint.

Although capable of\nprecisely detecting the amplitude and phase of weak signals, conventional RAQRs\nface inherent limitations in accurately receiving wideband RF signals, due to\nthe discrete nature of atomic energy levels and their intrinsic instantaneous\nbandwidth constraints. These limitations hinder their direct application to\nmulti-carrier communication and sensing. To address this issue, this paper\nproposes a multi-carrier Rydberg atomic quantum receiver (MC-RAQR) structure\nwith five energy levels. We derive the amplitude and phase of the MC-RAQR and\nextract the baseband electrical signal for signal processing. In terms of\nmulti-carrier communication and sensing, we analyze the channel capacity and\naccuracy of angle of arrival (AoA) and distance parameters, respectively.\nNumerical results validate our proposed model, showing that the MC-RAQR can\nachieve up to a bandwidth of 14 MHz, which is 56-fold larger than the\nconventional RAQRs. As a result, the channel capacity and the resolution for\nmulti-target sensing are improved significantly. Specifically, the channel\ncapacity of MC-RAQR is 22-fold and 3-fold larger than the conventional antennas\nand RAQRs, respectively. For sensing performance, the MSE of AoA estimation for\nMC-RAQR is 0.16% of the conventional RAQR and the MSE of distance estimation is\n0.01% of the CRB of conventional antennas, showing the superior performance of\nthe MC-RAQR.

Most existing channel prediction and predictive\nbeamforming methods are limited by model generalization capabilities and\nstruggle to adapt to time-varying wireless propagation environments. Inspired\nby the remarkable generalization and reasoning capabilities of large language\nmodels (LLMs), this work proposes an LLM-based channel prediction framework,\nnamely CPLLM, to forecast future channel state information (CSI) for LEO\nsatellites based on historical CSI data. In the proposed CPLLM, a dedicated CSI\nencoder is designed to map raw CSI data into the textual embedding space,\neffectively bridging the modality gap and enabling the LLM to perform reliable\nreasoning over CSI data. Additionally, a CSI decoder is introduced to\nsimultaneously predict CSI for multiple future time slots, substantially\nreducing the computational burden and inference latency associated with the\ninherent autoregressive decoding process of LLMs. Then, instead of training the\nLLM from scratch, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, i.e.,\nLoRA, for CPLLM, where the pretrained LLM remains frozen and trainable low-rank\nmatrices are injected into each Transformer decoder layer to enable effective\nfine-tuning. Furthermore, we extend CPLLM to directly generate beamforming\nstrategies for future time slots based on historical CSI data, namely BFLLM.\nThis extended framework retains the same architecture as CPLLM, while\nintroducing a dedicated beamforming decoder to output beamforming strategies.\nFinally, extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed approaches in channel prediction and predictive beamforming for LEO\nsatellite communications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6CPLLM\u548cbeamforming\u6846\u67b6BFLLM\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u5730\u7403\u8f68\u9053\uff08LEO\uff09\u536b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u901f\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027beamforming\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u53d8\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u64ad\u73af\u5883\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "CPLLM\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2aCSI\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u59cbCSI\u6570\u636e\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2aCSI\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u4e2a\u672a\u6765\u65f6\u95f4\u69fd\u7684CSI\u3002BFLLM\u6846\u67b6\u5728CPLLM\u67b6\u6784\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7684beamforming\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\u5747\u91c7\u7528LoRA\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u51bb\u7ed3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\uff0c\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LEO\u536b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u9053\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027beamforming\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684CPLLM\u548cBFLLM\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff08CSI\uff09\u5e76\u751f\u6210beamforming\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u5347LEO\u536b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We first highlight\nthe dual-use nature of RIS, demonstrating how its communication-enhancing\ncapabilities can be exploited by adversaries to compromise legitimate users. We\nidentify a new class of security vulnerabilities termed ``passive-active hybrid\nattacks,'' where RIS, despite passively handling signals, can be reconfigured\nto actively engage in malicious activities, enabling various RIS-assisted\nattacks, such as eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle (MITM), replay, reflection\njamming, and side-channel attacks. Furthermore, we reveal how adversaries can\nexploit the openness of wireless channels to introduce adversarial\nperturbations in artificial intelligence-driven RIS networks, disrupting\ncommunication terminals and causing misclassifications or errors in RIS\nreflection predictions. Despite these risks, RIS technology also plays a\ncritical role in enhancing security and privacy across radio frequency (RF) and\nvisible light communication (VLC) systems.

We provide an active solution employing dynamic\nwatermarking that was originally developed for the security of cyber-physical\nsystems. This technique calls for a car to superpose a small random excitation\nonto its actuation commands for steering angle or throttle/brake positions. The\ncar sends this random waveform to the RSU in a packet containing its IP\naddress. By signal processing of the video stream of a car at the RSU it can\nverify whether it matches with the waveform in the packet and thereby\nassociates that the IP address of the packet with that car in the visual field.\nThe RSU thereby determines which IP address is associated with which car in its\nvisual field.

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for\n  possible publication", "summary": "A common assumption in signal processing is that underlying data numerically\nconforms to a Gaussian distribution. It is commonly utilized in signal\nprocessing to describe unknown additive noise in a system and is often\njustified by citing the central limit theorem for sums of random variables,\nalthough the central limit theorem applies only to sums of independent\nidentically distributed random variables. However, many linear operations in\nsignal processing take the form of weighted sums, which transforms the random\nvariables such that their distributions are no longer identical. One such\noperation is a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. FIR filters are commonly\nused in signal processing applications as a pre-processing step. FIR output\nnoise is generally assumed to be Gaussian. This article examines the FIR output\nresponse in the presence of uniformly distributed quantization noise. We\nexpress the FIR output uncertainty in terms of the input quantization\nuncertainty and filter coefficients. We show that the output uncertainty cannot\nbe assumed to be Gaussian, but depending on the application a Gaussian\nestimation may still be useful. Then, we show through detailed numerical\nsimulations that the output uncertainty distribution of the filter can be\nestimated through its most dominant coefficients."}

Traditional\nwireless communication and sensing networks fall short in meeting all the\nstringent demands of eHealth, including accurate sensing, high data efficiency,\nand privacy preservation. To overcome the challenges, we propose a novel\nintegrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) framework. In\nthe proposed system, a service robot utilises radar to detect patient positions\nand monitor their vital signs, while sending updates to the medical devices.\nInstead of transmitting raw physiological information, the robot computes and\ncommunicates semantically extracted health features to medical devices. This\nsemantic processing improves data throughput and preserves the clinical\nrelevance of the messages, while enhancing data privacy by avoiding the\ntransmission of sensitive data. Leveraging the estimated patient locations, the\nrobot employs an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter to actively track\npatient motion, thereby enabling robust beam steering for continuous and\nreliable monitoring. We then propose a joint optimisation of the beamforming\nmatrices and the semantic extraction ratio, subject to computing capability and\npower budget constraints, with the objective of maximising both the semantic\nsecrecy rate and sensing accuracy. Simulation results validate that the ISCSC\nframework achieves superior sensing accuracy, improved semantic transmission\nefficiency, and enhanced privacy preservation compared to conventional joint\nsensing and communication methods."}

Unlike previous studies that rely on the use-and-then-forget (UatF)\nlower bound on Shannon achievable (ergodic) rates, our proposed framework can\ndeal with alternative bounds that explicitly consider perfect or imperfect\nchannel state information (CSI) at the decoder. In doing so, we address\nlimitations of UatF-based algorithms, which inherit the shortcomings of the\nUatF bound. For example, the UatF bound can be overly conservative: in extreme\ncases, under fully statistical (nonadaptive) beamforming in zero-mean channels,\nthe UatF bound produces trivial (zero) rate bounds. It also lacks scale\ninvariance: merely scaling the beamformers can change the bound drastically,\nespecially when simple beamforming strategies are employed. In contrast, our\nframework is compatible with information-theoretic bounds that do not suffer\nfrom the above drawbacks. We illustrate the framework by solving a max-min\npower control problem considering a standard bound that exploits instantaneous\nCSI at the decoder."}

To address this issue, we propose to\nintegrate antenna element self-calibration into a variational sparse Bayesian\nlearning (VSBL) algorithm for parametric channel estimation. We model antenna\ngain and phase deviations as latent variables and derive explicit update\nequations to jointly infer these calibration parameters and the channel\nparameters: the model order, complex amplitudes, delays, angles, and the noise\nvariance. The resulting algorithm operates online and adapts in real time to\nhardware-induced mismatches. We assess its performance in terms of the root\nmean square error (RMSE) and the optimal subpattern-assignment (OSPA) metric,\ndemonstrating consistent improvements over conventional VSBL without\ncalibration.
