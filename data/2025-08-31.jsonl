Brinton"], "title": "Error Analysis for Over-the-Air Federated Learning under Misaligned and Time-Varying Channels", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper investigates an OFDM-based over-the-air federated learning\n(OTA-FL) system, where multiple mobile devices, e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles\n(UAVs), transmit local machine learning (ML) models to a central parameter\nserver (PS) for global model aggregation. The high mobility of local devices\nresults in imperfect channel estimation, leading to a misalignment problem,\ni.e., the model parameters transmitted from different local devices do not\narrive at the central PS simultaneously. Moreover, the mobility introduces\ntime-varying uploading channels, which further complicates the aggregation\nprocess. All these factors collectively cause distortions in the OTA-FL\ntraining process which are underexplored. To quantify these effects, we first\nderive a closed-form expression for a single-round global model update in terms\nof these channel imperfections. We then extend our analysis to capture multiple\nrounds of global updates, yielding a bound on the accumulated error in OTA-FL.\nWe validate our theoretical results via extensive numerical simulations, which\ncorroborate our derived analysis."}

We separately establish the near-\nand hybrid-field channel models for IRS-reflected links to evaluate the\nperformance gain more precisely and practically. Specifically, we formulate an\noptimization problem of maximizing the harvested power by jointly optimizing\ndual-IRS phase shifts, independent PS ratio, and receive beamforming vector in\nboth near- and hybrid-field cases. In the near-field case, the alternating\noptimization algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex problem by applying\nthe Lagrange duality method and the difference-of-convex (DC) programming. In\nthe hybrid-field case, we first present an interesting result that the\nAP-IRS-user channel gains are invariant to the phase shifts of dual-IRS, which\nallows the optimization problem to be transformed into a convex one. Then, we\nderive the asymptotic performance of the combined channel gains in closed-form\nand analyze the characteristics of the dual-IRS. Numerical results validate our\nanalysis and indicate the performance gains of the proposed scheme that\ndual-IRS-aided SWIPT with independent PS over other benchmark schemes."}

Accepted in 47th Annual International\n  Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)\n  2025", "summary": "Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. This disease\nrequires reliable and efficient seizure detection methods.\nElectroencephalography (EEG) is the gold standard for seizure monitoring, but\nits manual analysis is a time-consuming task that requires expert knowledge. In\naddition, there are no well-defined features that allow fully automated\nanalysis. Existing deep learning-based approaches struggle to achieve high\nsensitivity while maintaining a low false alarm rate per hour (FAR/h) and lack\nconsistency in the optimal EEG input representation, whether in the time or\nfrequency domain. To address these issues, we propose a Deep Convolutional\nAutoencoder (DCAE) to extract low-dimensional latent representations that\npreserve essential EEG signal features. The ability of the model to preserve\nrelevant information was evaluated by comparing reconstruction errors based on\nboth time series and frequency-domain representations. Several autoencoders\nwith different loss functions based on time and frequency were trained and\nevaluated to determine their effectiveness in reconstructing EEG features. Our\nresults show that the DCAE model taking both time series and frequency losses\ninto account achieved the best reconstruction performance. This indicates that\nDeep Neural Networks with a single representation might not preserve the\nrelevant signal properties. This work provides insight into how deep learning\nmodels process EEG data and examines whether frequency information is captured\nwhen time series signals are used as input."}

In\nthis study, we proposed an adaptative filtering method for MMG accelerometers\nbased on the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition, with adaptative\nnoise and spectral fuzzy entropy, to isolate motions artefacts from the MMG\nsignal in dynamic conditions. We compared our method with the traditional\nband-pass filtering technique, demonstrating better results concerning motion\nrecomposition for deltoid and erector spinae muscles (R${}^2$ = 0.907 and\n0.842). Thus, this innovative method allows the filtering of motion artifacts\ndynamically in the 5-20 Hz bandwidth, which is not achievable with traditional\nmethod. However, the interpretation of accelerometric MMG signals from the\ntrunk and lower-limb muscles during walking or running should be approached\nwith great caution as impact-related accelerations are still present, though\ntheir exact quantity still needs to be quantified."}

In this paper, we investigate the derivation of\nlower bounds for such systems. In particular, we develop the weighted Bayesian\nCramer-Rao bound (WBCRB) for the mixed-resolution setting with a general weight\nfunction. We demonstrate the special cases of: (i) the classical BCRB; (ii) the\nWBCRB that is based on the Bayesian Fisher information matrix (BFIM)-Inverse\nweighting; and (iii) the Aharon-Tabrikian tightest WBCRB with an optimal weight\nfunction. Based on the developed WBCRB, we propose a new method to approximate\nthe mean-squared-error (MSE) by partitioning the estimation problem into two\nregions: (a) where the 1-bit quantized data is informative; and (b) where it is\nsaturated. We apply region-specific WBCRB approximations in these regions to\nachieve an accurate composite MSE estimate. We derive the bounds and MSE\napproximation for the linear Gaussian orthonormal (LGO) model, which is\ncommonly used in practical signal processing applications. Our simulation\nresults demonstrate the use of the proposed bounds and approximation method in\nthe LGO model with a scalar unknown parameter. It is shown that the WBCRB\noutperforms the BCRB, where the BFIM-Inverse weighting version approaches the\noptimal WBCRB. Moreover, it is shown that the WBCRB-based MSE approximation is\ntighter and accurately predicts the non-monotonic behavior of the MSE in the\npresence of quantization errors."}

Our study introduces novel adaptations of the Prony and MUSIC\nalgorithms tailored for real-time heart and respiration rate monitoring,\nsignificantly advancing the accuracy and reliability of non-contact vital sign\nmonitoring using radar technologies. Notably, these algorithms demonstrate a\nrobust ability to suppress noise and harmonic interference. For instance, the\nmean absolute errors (MAE) for MUSIC and Prony in heart rate detection are 1.8\nand 0.81, respectively, while for respiration rate, the MAEs are 1.01 and 0.8,\nrespectively. These results underscore the potential of FMCW radar as a\nreliable, non-invasive solution for continuous vital sign monitoring in\nhealthcare settings, particularly in clinical and emergency scenarios where\ntraditional contact-based monitoring is impractical."}
