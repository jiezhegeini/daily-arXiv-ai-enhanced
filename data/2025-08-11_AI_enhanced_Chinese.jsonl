Industry-scale DLRMs are trained\nwith petabytes of recommendation data to serve billions of users every day. To\nutilize the rich user signals in the long user history, DLRMs have been scaled\nup to unprecedented complexity, up to trillions of floating-point operations\n(TFLOPs) per example. This scale, coupled with the huge amount of training\ndata, necessitates new storage and training algorithms to efficiently improve\nthe quality of these complex recommendation systems. In this paper, we present\na Request-Only Optimizations (ROO) training and modeling paradigm. ROO\nsimultaneously improves the storage and training efficiency as well as the\nmodel quality of recommendation systems. We holistically approach this\nchallenge through co-designing data (i.e., request-only data), infrastructure\n(i.e., request-only based data processing pipeline), and model architecture\n(i.e., request-only neural architectures). Our ROO training and modeling\nparadigm treats a user request as a unit of the training data. Compared with\nthe established practice of treating a user impression as a unit, our new\ndesign achieves native feature deduplication in data logging, consequently\nsaving data storage.

In this work, we\npropose a novel framework that explicitly models transitional\nqueries--intermediate reformulations occurring during the user's journey toward\ntheir final purchase intent. By mining structured query trajectories from\neBay's large-scale user interaction logs, we reconstruct query sequences that\nreflect shifts in intent while preserving semantic coherence.

Furthermore, we incorporate\ngenerative Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce semantically diverse and\nintent-preserving alternative queries, extending beyond what can be derived\nthrough collaborative filtering alone. These reformulations can be leveraged to\npopulate Related Searches or to power intent-clustered carousels on the search\nresults page, enhancing both discovery and engagement.

Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards\n(RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these\nMLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment,\nwhich prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations.

With minimal\nuser input - following a protocol to label variables as stocks,\nflows/auxiliaries, or constants - D2D leverages the structural information\nalready encoded in CLDs, namely, link existence and polarity, to simulate\nhypothetical interventions and explore potential leverage points under\nuncertainty. Results suggest that D2D helps distinguish between high- and\nlow-ranked leverage points. We compare D2D to a data-driven SDM constructed\nfrom the same CLD and variable labeling. D2D showed greater consistency with\nthe data-driven model than network centrality analysis, while providing\nuncertainty estimates and guidance for future data collection. The method is\nimplemented in an open-source Python package and a web-based application to\nsupport further testing and lower the barrier to dynamic modeling for\nresearchers working with CLDs.

However, real-world utility data originates from multiple sources\nwith varying characteristics and levels of quality. In this work, developed in\ncollaboration with Oncor Electric Delivery, we propose a scalable framework\nthat reconstructs a trustworthy grid topology by systematically integrating\nheterogeneous data. We observe that distribution topology is fundamentally\ngoverned by two complementary dimensions: the spatial layout of physical\ninfrastructure (e.g., GIS and asset metadata) and the dynamic behavior of the\nsystem in the signal domain (e.g., voltage time series). When jointly\nleveraged, these dimensions support a complete and physically coherent\nreconstruction of network connectivity. To address the challenge of uneven data\nquality without compromising observability, we introduce a confidence-aware\ninference mechanism that preserves structurally informative yet imperfect\ninputs, while quantifying the reliability of each inferred connection for\noperator interpretation.

To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel framework that integrates TAPE (Text-Attributed Graph\nRepresentation Enhancement) with Graphormer.

We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on the\nchallenging ogbn-arxiv dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a\nclassification accuracy of 0.772, significantly surpassing the best GCN\nbaseline of 0.713.

In addition to maintaining acceptable collision\nrisks, this approach seeks to minimize the average fuel consumption of CAMs by\nmaking early maneuver decisions. We model CAM as a continuous state, discrete\naction and finite horizon MDP, where the critical decision is determining when\nto initiate the maneuver. The MDP model also incorporates analytical models for\nconjunction risk, propellant consumption, and transit orbit geometry. The\nMarkov policy effectively trades-off maneuver delay-which improves the\nreliability of conjunction risk indicators-with propellant consumption-which\nincreases with decreasing maneuver time. Using historical data of tracked\nconjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive ablation\nstudy on the hyper-parameters used within the MDP.

We present a practical, three-stage pipeline that\nenables scalable, high-precision prosocial content classification while\nminimizing human labeling effort and inference costs. First, we identify the\nbest LLM-based labeling strategy using a small seed set of human-labeled\nexamples. We then introduce a human-AI refinement loop, where annotators review\nhigh-disagreement cases between GPT-4 and humans to iteratively clarify and\nexpand the task definition-a critical step for emerging annotation tasks like\nprosociality.

Finally, we synthesize 10k high-quality labels using GPT-4 and train\na two-stage inference system: a lightweight classifier handles high-confidence\npredictions, while only $\\sim$35\\% of ambiguous instances are escalated to\nGPT-4o.

Decomposition is done by applying machine learning to fit\na dual signal. Machine learning minimizes the loss function which compromises\nbetween fitting the original time series and penalizing irregularities of the\ndual signal. The latter includes terms based on the first and second order\nderivatives along time. To preserve special patterns, weighting of the\nregularization components of the loss function has been introduced based on\nStatistical Process Control methodology. The proposed decomposition can be\napplied as a smoothing algorithm against the mean and dispersion of the time\nseries. By isolating noise, the proposed decomposition can be seen as a\ndenoising algorithm. Two approaches of the learning process have been\nconsidered: sequential and jointly. The former approach learns the mean signal\nfirst and then dispersion. The latter approach fits the dual signal jointly.\nJointly learning can uncover complex relationships for the time series with\nheteroskedasticity. Learning has been set by solving the direct non-linear\nunconstrained optimization problem or by applying neural networks that have\nsequential or twin output architectures. Tuning of the loss function\nhyperparameters focuses on the isolated noise to be a stationary stochastic\nprocess without autocorrelation properties. Depending on the applications, the\nhyperparameters of the learning can be tuned towards either the discrete states\nby stepped signal or smoothed series.

A significant\nchallenge in this domain arises from the inherent discrepancies between topics.\nWhile existing methods predominantly focus on extracting topic-shared features\nthrough distribution alignment of source and target topics, they often neglect\ntopic-specific features, limiting their ability to assess critical traits such\nas topic adherence. To address this limitation, we propose an Adversarial\nTOpic-aware Prompt-tuning (ATOP), a novel method that jointly learns\ntopic-shared and topic-specific features to improve cross-topic AES.

To enhance the robustness of topic-shared prompt\nlearning and mitigate feature scale sensitivity introduced by topic alignment,\nwe incorporate adversarial training within a unified regression and\nclassification framework.

While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic\nprogramming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior\n-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the\nsearch is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space\nexploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have\nbeen proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not\nbeen systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative\neffectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and\nanytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some\nexisting anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous\napproaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various\nheuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm\nreuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching,\ncombined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning\ncriteria to improve solution quality over time.

Traditional modular approaches,\nwhile offering interpretability, suffer from error propagation and coordination\nissues, whereas end-to-end learning systems can simplify the design but face\ncomputational bottlenecks. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous\ndriving using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that integrates bird's-eye view\n(BEV) perception for enhanced real-time decision-making. We introduce the\n\\texttt{Mamba-BEV} model, an efficient spatio-temporal feature extraction\nnetwork that combines BEV-based perception with the Mamba framework for\ntemporal feature modeling. This integration allows the system to encode vehicle\nsurroundings and road features in a unified coordinate system and accurately\nmodel long-range dependencies.

However, excessively long reasoning traces introduce substantial\nchallenges in terms of training cost, inference latency, and deployment\nfeasibility. While various CoT compression approaches have emerged to address\nthis challenge, they face inherent trade-offs: token-level methods often\ndisrupt syntactic and logical coherence, while step-level methods based on\nperplexity fail to reliably capture the logically critical reasoning steps. In\nthis paper, we propose ASAP (Anchor-guided, Surprisal-based Pruning), a novel\ncoarse-to-fine framework for CoT compression. ASAP first performs anchor-guided\npruning to preserve the core reasoning structure, which efficiently reduces the\nsearch space for subsequent processing. It then enables a logic-aware pruning\nby selecting logically essential reasoning steps based on a novel first-token\nsurprisal metric. Finally, ASAP teaches models to autonomously generate and\nleverage these concise CoTs at inference time, enabling efficient reasoning in\ncoding tasks.

Clinical\ninformation that informs prognostication is collected serially over time.\nShortly after cardiac arrest, various time-invariant baseline features are\ncollected (e.g., demographics, cardiac arrest characteristics). After ICU\nadmission, additional features are gathered, including time-varying hemodynamic\ndata (e.g., blood pressure, doses of vasopressor medications).

In this study, we propose a novel\nstepwise dynamic competing risks model that improves the prediction of\nneurological outcomes by automatically determining when to take advantage of\ntime-invariant features (first phase) and time-varying features (second phase).\nNotably, our model finds patients for whom this second phase (time-varying\nhemodynamic) information is beneficial for prognostication and also when this\ninformation is beneficial (as we collect more hemodynamic data for a patient\nover time, how important these data are for prognostication varies). Our\napproach extends the standard Fine and Gray model to explicitly model the two\nphases and to incorporate neural networks to flexibly capture complex nonlinear\nfeature relationships. Evaluated on a retrospective cohort of 2,278 comatose\npost-arrest patients, our model demonstrates robust discriminative performance\nfor the competing outcomes of awakening, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy,\nand death despite maximal support.

To address these limitations, we\npropose Selective Reflection Distillation (SRD), a novel data curation\nframework that leverages reflections from student models to systematically\nrefine training data. SRD dynamically evaluates and selects prompt-response\npairs by comparing ground truth data with student model outputs, selectively\ncurating high-quality, student-compatible training instances through automated\nranking based on difficulty. Furthermore, after selecting the training data, a\ncurriculum scheduling strategy is employed to incrementally introduce these\ncurated subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals.

As a more\nfeasible alternative, inferring user preferences from massive implicit feedback\nhas shown great potential (e.g., a user quickly skipping a recommended video\nusually indicates disinterest). Unfortunately, implicit feedback is often\nnoisy: a user might skip a video due to accidental clicks or other reasons,\nrather than disliking it. Such noise can easily misjudge user interests,\nthereby undermining recommendation performance. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel Group-aware User Behavior Simulation (G-UBS) paradigm, which\nleverages contextual guidance from relevant user groups, enabling robust and\nin-depth interpretation of implicit feedback for individual users.\nSpecifically, G-UBS operates via two key agents. First, the User Group Manager\n(UGM) effectively clusters users to generate group profiles utilizing a\n``summarize-cluster-reflect\" workflow based on LLMs. Second, the User Feedback\nModeler (UFM) employs an innovative group-aware reinforcement learning\napproach, where each user is guided by the associated group profiles during the\nreinforcement learning process, allowing UFM to robustly and deeply examine the\nreasons behind implicit feedback. To assess our G-UBS paradigm, we have\nconstructed a Video Recommendation benchmark with Implicit Feedback (IF-VR).

It proposes an interpretable\nbias detection method aimed at identifying hidden social biases in model\noutputs, especially those semantic tendencies that are not easily captured\nthrough explicit linguistic features. The method combines nested semantic\nrepresentation with a contextual contrast mechanism. It extracts latent bias\nfeatures from the vector space structure of model outputs. Using attention\nweight perturbation, it analyzes the model's sensitivity to specific social\nattribute terms, thereby revealing the semantic pathways through which bias is\nformed. To validate the effectiveness of the method, this study uses the\nStereoSet dataset, which covers multiple stereotype dimensions including\ngender, profession, religion, and race. The evaluation focuses on several key\nmetrics, such as bias detection accuracy, semantic consistency, and contextual\nsensitivity. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves strong\ndetection performance across various dimensions. It can accurately identify\nbias differences between semantically similar texts while maintaining high\nsemantic alignment and output stability.

A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which\nprunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.\nHowever, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,\napplying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and\nstatistical heterogeneity of model parameters.

To address this limitation, we introduce \\textbf{TADrop}\n(\\textbf{T}ensor-wise \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{Drop}), an adaptive\nsparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global\nratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based\non its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with\ndenser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser,\nmore critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we\nvalidate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging\nmethods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and\nmultimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and\nsignificantly boosts their performance.

As a\nresult, effectively capturing users' latest preferences is challenging, as\ninteractions reflecting recent interests are limited and new items often lack\nsufficient feedback. A common solution is to enrich item representations using\nmultimodal encoders (e.g., BERT or ViT) to extract visual and textual features.\nHowever, these encoders are pretrained on general-purpose tasks: they are not\ntailored to user preference modeling, and they overlook the fact that user\ntastes toward modality-specific features such as visual styles and textual\ntones can also drift over time. This presents two key challenges in streaming\nscenarios: the high cost of fine-tuning large multimodal encoders, and the risk\nof forgetting long-term user preferences due to continuous model updates.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose Expandable Side Mixture-of-Experts\n(XSMoE), a memory-efficient framework for multimodal streaming recommendation.\nXSMoE attaches lightweight side-tuning modules consisting of expandable expert\nnetworks to frozen pretrained encoders and incrementally expands them in\nresponse to evolving user feedback. A gating router dynamically combines expert\nand backbone outputs, while a utilization-based pruning strategy maintains\nmodel compactness. By learning new patterns through expandable experts without\noverwriting previously acquired knowledge, XSMoE effectively captures both cold\nstart and shifting preferences in multimodal features.

Nevertheless, here we show that a similar intuition can be\nfleshed out in a different way: whenever an agent is able to perform a\nregulation task, it is possible for an observer to interpret it as having\n\"beliefs\" about its environment, which it \"updates\" in response to sensory\ninput. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more\nsophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more\nbroadly applicable.

With the emergence of large language models\n(LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further\nrefined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the\ntraditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures\ndestabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine\nCommunication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second\nsection examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the\nmachine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics\ncontinue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to\npredictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the\nRational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing\non optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the\nissue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and\ncommunicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM\nevaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the\npaper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of\nincreased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding,\nemphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both\nfor the model and themselves.

Central to our framework is an RL-based inserter,\nInserter-R1-3B, trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization to guide image\nselection and placement in a controllable and semantically aligned manner.\nEmpirical results show that our lightweight 3B inserter achieves strong\nreasoning capabilities with significantly reduced latency, outperforming\nbaselines in both quality and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6M2IO-R1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u56fe\u7247\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u6392\u5e03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210( MRAG) \u591a\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684Inserter-R1-3B\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u7f6e\u653e\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

A number of following\npublications have shown that the effectiveness of these models can be improved\nby, for example, slightly updating the architecture of the Transformer layers,\nusing better training objectives, and employing improved loss functions.\nHowever, the additivity of these modular improvements has not been\nsystematically benchmarked - this is the gap we aim to close in this paper.\nThrough our experiments, we identify a very strong model that uses SASRec's\ntraining objective, LiGR Transformer layers, and Sampled Softmax Loss. We call\nthis combination eSASRec (Enhanced SASRec). While we primarily focus on\nrealistic, production-like evaluation, in our preliminarily study we find that\ncommon academic benchmarks show eSASRec to be 23% more effective compared to\nthe most recent state-of-the-art models, such as ActionPiece.

To address these limitations, we propose Matrix-Driven Instant\nReview (MDIR), a novel method that leverages matrix analysis and Large\nDeviation Theory. MDIR achieves accurate reconstruction of weight\nrelationships, provides rigorous $p$-value estimation, and focuses exclusively\non weight similarity without requiring full model inference. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that MDIR reliably detects plagiarism even after extensive\ntransformations, such as random permutations and continual pretraining with\ntrillions of tokens. Moreover, all detections can be performed on a single PC\nwithin an hour, making MDIR both efficient and accessible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u527d\u7a83\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5MDIR\uff0c\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u6284\u88ad\u5e76\u9644\u5e26\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u5355\u673a\u4e0a\u5feb\u901f\u5b8c\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u527d\u7a83\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u527d\u7a83\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u77e9\u9635\u9a71\u52a8\u5373\u65f6\u5ba1\u67e5\uff08MDIR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u7406\u8bba\u5b9e\u73b0\u6743\u91cd\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMDIR\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u527d\u7a83\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7ecf\u8fc7\u590d\u6742\u53d8\u6362\u540e\u4ecd\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5feb\u901f\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u5355\u673a\u4e0a\u5feb\u901f\u5b8c\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "MDIR\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u624b\u6bb5\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u527d\u7a83\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, there remains a significant research gap in combining\nthese capabilities to enable emotionally supportive interactions with virtual\ncharacters. To address this research gap, we focus on anime characters as a\ncase study because of their well-defined personalities and large fan bases.\nThis choice enables us to effectively evaluate how well LLMs can provide\nemotional support while maintaining specific character traits. We introduce\nChatAnime, the first Emotionally Supportive Role-Playing (ESRP) dataset. We\nfirst thoughtfully select 20 top-tier characters from popular anime communities\nand design 60 emotion-centric real-world scenario questions. Then, we execute a\nnationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with\nprofound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in\nrole-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from\n10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts. To evaluate the ESRP\nperformance of LLMs, we design a user experience-oriented evaluation system\nfeaturing 9 fine-grained metrics across three dimensions: basic dialogue,\nrole-playing and emotional support, along with an overall metric for response\ndiversity.

Traditional multilingual\nmodels, which require simultaneous access to all language data, are impractical\ndue to the sequential arrival of data and privacy constraints. Continual\nLearning (CL) offers a solution by enabling models to learn new languages\nsequentially without catastrophically forgetting previously learned knowledge.\nThis paper investigates CL for ASR on Indian languages using a subset of the\nIndicSUPERB benchmark. We employ a Conformer-based hybrid RNN-T/CTC model,\ninitially pretrained on Hindi, which is then incrementally trained on eight\nadditional Indian languages, for a total sequence of nine languages. We\nevaluate three prominent regularization- and distillation-based CL strategies:\nElastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), and Learning\nwithout Forgetting (LwF), selected for their suitability in no-replay,\nprivacy-conscious scenarios. Performance is analyzed using Word Error Rate\n(WER) for both RNN-T and CTC paths on clean and noisy data, as well as\nknowledge retention via Backward Transfer. We also explore the impact of\nvarying the number of training epochs (1, 2, 5, and 10) per task. Results,\ncompared against naive fine-tuning, demonstrate CLs effectiveness in mitigating\nforgetting, making it a promising approach for scalable ASR in diverse Indian\nlanguages under realistic constraints.

Similar to SNNs,\ndeep state-space models (SSMs) utilize stateful building blocks.

Their adaptability raises the question of\nwhether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer\nto unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training. To examine this, we\nfine-tune lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B models on monolingual, bilingual, or\nmultilingual data sets to classify immigration-related tweets from X/Twitter\nacross 13 languages, a domain characterised by polarised, culturally specific\ndiscourse. We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables\ncross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects\npre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages\ncan reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However,\nidentifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance\nbenefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant\nlanguages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during\nfine-tuning (as little as $9.62\\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training\ntoken volume) yields significant gains. These findings challenge the assumption\nthat cross-lingual mastery requires extensive multilingual training: limited\nlanguage coverage suffices for topic-level generalisation, and structural\nbiases can be corrected with lightweight interventions.

In this work, we introduce Fractional\nClassification Loss (FCL), an adaptive robust loss that automatically\ncalibrates its robustness to label noise during training. Built within the\nactive-passive loss framework, FCL employs the fractional derivative of the\nCross-Entropy (CE) loss as its active component and the Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE) as its passive loss component. With this formulation, we demonstrate that\nthe fractional derivative order $\\mu$ spans a family of loss functions that\ninterpolate between MAE-like robustness and CE-like fast convergence.\nFurthermore, we integrate $\\mu$ into the gradient-based optimization as a\nlearnable parameter and automatically adjust it to optimize the trade-off\nbetween robustness and convergence speed. We reveal that FCL's unique property\nestablishes a critical trade-off that enables the stable learning of $\\mu$:\nlower log penalties on difficult or mislabeled examples improve robustness but\nimpose higher penalties on easy or clean data, reducing model confidence in\nthem.

In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative\nframework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical\nprompt tokens during the forward pass.

We investigate two types of haptic\ntokenizers, a frequency-based tokenizer and an EnCodec-based tokenizer, that\nconvert haptic signals into sequences of discrete units, enabling their\nintegration with the LLaMA model. HapticLLaMA is trained in two stages: (1)\nsupervised fine-tuning using the LLaMA architecture with LoRA-based adaptation,\nand (2) fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We\nassess HapticLLaMA's captioning performance using both automated n-gram metrics\nand human evaluation. HapticLLaMA demonstrates strong capability in\ninterpreting haptic vibration signals, achieving a METEOR score of 59.98 and a\nBLEU-4 score of 32.06 respectively.

The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately\nfabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a\nsignificant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such\ndeception by explicitly setting a \"hidden\" objective through prompting or\nfine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions.\nMoving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated\ndeception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this\nevaluation, we propose a novel framework using \"contact searching questions.\"\nThis framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological\nprinciples to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive\nIntention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The\nsecond, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's\ninternal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we\nfind that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in\nparallel for most models. Building on these findings, we formulate a\nmathematical model to explain this behavior.

Finally, we\npropose new evaluation metrics tailored to the LLM setting and validate our\napproach on standard benchmarks such as TOFU, WMDP, and SafePKU.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGRIN\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684LLM\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u6bd4\u7387\u6307\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u5fd8\u8bb0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u5bf9LLMs\u5728\u654f\u611f\u6216\u672a\u6388\u6743\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u5fd8\u8bb0\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u68af\u5ea6\u6bd4\u7387\u6307\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728TOFU\u3001WMDP\u3001SafePKU\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u5fd8\u8bb0\u3002", "conclusion": "GRIN\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LLM\u53d6\u6d88\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5fd8\u8bb0\u3002"}}
