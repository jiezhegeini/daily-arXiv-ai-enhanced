*Narges Rashvand,Kenneth Witham,Gabriel Maldonado,Vinit Katariya,Aly Sultan,Gunar Schirner,Hamed Tabkhi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出两种分布式学习方法用于自动调制识别（AMR），在降低带宽的同时保持高识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于深度学习的AMR方法通常采用集中式训练，需要将所有数据传输到计算能力强的设备上，这对于带宽受限的无线网络来说不切实际。

Method: 提出两种分布式学习方法：1. 基于共识投票的分布式AMR；2. 每个接收器共享其特征图，并由中心节点聚合的分布式AMR。

Result: 在TeMuRAMRD 2023数据集上进行实验，与集中式AMR（6个接收器，准确率91%）相比，提出的分布式方法在显著降低带宽（分别为集中式的1/256和1/8）的同时，取得了具有竞争力的准确率。单个接收器的准确率约为41%。

Conclusion: 分布式AMR能够有效提高准确率，同时满足带宽受限无线网络的需求，为AMR技术在实际应用中提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) is critical in identifying various
modulation types in wireless communication systems. Recent advancements in deep
learning have facilitated the integration of algorithms into AMR techniques.
However, this integration typically follows a centralized approach that
necessitates collecting and processing all training data on high-powered
computing devices, which may prove impractical for bandwidth-limited wireless
networks. In response to this challenge, this study introduces two methods for
distributed learning-based AMR on the collaboration of multiple receivers to
perform AMR tasks. The TeMuRAMRD 2023 dataset is employed to support this
investigation, uniquely suited for multi-receiver AMR tasks. Within this
distributed sensing environment, multiple receivers collaborate in identifying
modulation types from the same RF signal, each possessing a partial perspective
of the overall environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the
centralized-based AMR, with six receivers, attains an impressive accuracy rate
of 91%, while individual receivers exhibit a notably lower accuracy, at around
41%. Nonetheless, the two proposed decentralized learning-based AMR methods
exhibit noteworthy enhancements. Based on consensus voting among six receivers,
the initial method achieves a marginally lower accuracy. It achieves this while
substantially reducing the bandwidth demands to a 1/256th of the centralized
model. With the second distributed method, each receiver shares its feature
map, subsequently aggregated by a central node. This approach also accompanies
a substantial bandwidth reduction of 1/8 compared to the centralized approach.
These findings highlight the capacity of distributed AMR to significantly
enhance accuracy while effectively addressing the constraints of
bandwidth-limited wireless networks.

### [2] [Ambient Backscatter Communication Assisted by Fluid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24725)
*Masoud Kaveh,Farshad Rostami Ghadi,Riku Jantti,Kai-Kit Wong,F. Javier Lopez-Martinez*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究将流体可重构智能表面（FRIS）集成到环境回溯通信（AmBC）系统中，FRIS通过流体元件动态调整位置，增强空间适应性。通过粒子群优化（PSO）算法优化FRIS元件位置，以解决非凸优化问题。仿真结果表明，FRIS辅助AmBC在可实现吞吐量方面显著优于传统的基于RIS的AmBC系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在直接通信链路较弱或被阻挡的情况下，利用FRIS增强AmBC系统的通信性能。

Method: 提出FRIS辅助AmBC系统模型，并使用粒子群优化（PSO）算法优化FRIS元件位置，以最大化通信速率。

Result: FRIS辅助AmBC系统在可实现吞吐量方面显著优于传统的基于RIS的AmBC系统。

Conclusion: FRIS是提高AmBC系统性能的一种有效技术，尤其是在具有挑战性的通信环境中。

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of a fluid reconfigurable intelligent
surface (FRIS) into ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) systems. Unlike
conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with fixed position
elements, FRIS employs fluidic elements that can dynamically adjust their
positions, offering enhanced spatial adaptability. We develop a system model
where an AmBC tag communicates with a reader through an FRIS, which is
particularly beneficial in scenarios where the direct tag-to-reader link is
weak or blocked by obstacles. The achievable backscatter rate is analyzed, and
the optimization of FRIS element positions is formulated as a non-convex
problem. To address this, we employ particle swarm optimization (PSO) to obtain
near-optimal configurations of the fluid elements. Simulation results
demonstrate that FRIS-aided AmBC significantly outperforms conventional
RIS-based AmBC systems in terms of achievable throughput.

### [3] [Modelling Real-Life Cycling Decisions in Real Urban Settings Through Psychophysiology and LLM-Derived Contextual Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24726)
*Maximiliano Rosadio Z.,Angel Jimenez-Molina,Bastián Henríquez,Paulina Leiva,Ricardo Hurtubia,Ricardo De La Paz Guala,Leandro Gayozo,C. Angelo Guevara*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）从多媒体记录中提取上下文数据的新方法，以解决交通环境中情绪状态测量的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测量交通环境中的情绪状态很重要，但传统方法存在局限性。理解触发情绪变化的因素同样重要，但现实世界的数据收集面临挑战。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）处理从城市自行车案例研究中提取的图像序列，以获取环境的语义描述。然后，将这些上下文数据集成到一个混合模型中，该模型使用疲劳和唤醒作为潜在变量来影响从GPS数据推断出的自行车行为。

Conclusion: 通过LLM提取上下文数据并将其集成到混合模型中，可以有效地分析城市骑行者在不同环境和交通状况下的情绪状态和行为。

Abstract: Measuring emotional states in transportation contexts is an emerging field.
Methods based on self-reported emotions are limited by their low granularity
and their susceptibility to memory bias. In contrast, methods based on
physiological indicators provide continuous data, enabling researchers to
measure changes in emotional states with high detail and accuracy. Not only are
emotions important in the analysis, but understanding what triggers emotional
changes is equally important. Uncontrolled variables such as traffic
conditions, pedestrian interactions, and infrastructure remain a significant
challenge, as they can have a great impact on emotional states. Explaining the
reasons behind these emotional states requires gathering sufficient and proper
contextual data, which can be extremely difficult in real-world environments.
This paper addresses these challenges by applying an innovative approach,
extracting contextual data (expert annotator level) from recorded multimedia
using large language models (LLMs). In this paper, data are collected from an
urban cycling case study of the City of Santiago, Chile. The applied models
focus on understanding how different environments and traffic situations affect
the emotional states and behaviors of the participants using physiological
data. Sequences of images, extracted from the recorded videos, are processed by
LLMs to obtain semantic descriptions of the environment. These discrete,
although dense and detailed, contextual data are integrated into a hybrid
model, where fatigue and arousal serve as latent variables influencing observed
cycling behaviors (inferred from GPS data) like waiting, accelerating, braking,
etc. The study confirms that cycling decisions are influenced by stress-related
emotions and highlights the strong impact of urban characteristics and traffic
conditions on cyclist behavior.

### [4] [Aerial RIS-Enhanced Communications: Joint UAV Trajectory, Altitude Control, and Phase Shift Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24731)
*Bin Li,Dongdong Yang,Lei Liu,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 航空可重构智能表面（ARIS）通过优化其高度、轨迹和相位偏移，并结合基站波束成形，提高了通信性能，克服了无人机倾斜带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机（UAV）搭载的航空可重构智能表面（ARIS）虽然比地面RIS更灵活，但飞行中的倾斜和高度变化会导致严重的波束失配，降低性能。

Method: 提出一种基于欧拉角的ARIS控制方案，利用无人机的动力学模型联合优化ARIS的高度和轨迹。通过马尔可夫决策过程和软Actor-Critic算法学习ARIS控制策略，并采用水填充和二分法确定最优基站波束成形。

Result: 所提出的算法在收敛性和通信性能上显著优于基准，系统和速率提高了约14.4%，并有效缓解了ARIS倾斜导致性能下降的问题。

Conclusion: 该方案能自适应ARIS轨迹，有效缓解倾斜影响，在实际ARIS部署中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for enhancing wireless networks. Compared to terrestrial RIS deployed on
building facades, aerial RIS (ARIS) mounted on quadrotor unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) offers superior flexibility and extended coverage. However, the
inevitable tilt and altitude variations of a quadrotor UAV during flight may
lead to severe beam misalignment, significantly degrading ARIS's performance.
To address this challenge, we propose a Euler angles-based ARIS control scheme
that jointly optimizes the altitude and trajectory of the ARIS by leveraging
the UAV's dynamic model. Considering the constraints on ARIS flight energy
consumption, flight safety, and the transmission power of a base station (BS),
we jointly design the ARIS's altitude, trajectory, phase shifts, and BS
beamforming to maximize the system sum-rate. Due to the continuous control
nature of ARIS flight and the strong coupling among variables, we formulate the
problem as a Markov decision process and adopt a soft actor-critic algorithm
with prioritized experience replay to learn efficient ARIS control policies.
Based on the optimized ARIS configuration, we further employ the water-filling
and bisection method to efficiently determine the optimal BS beamforming.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly
outperforms benchmarks in both convergence and communication performance,
achieving approximately 14.4\% improvement in sum-rate. Moreover, in comparison
to the fixed-horizontal ARIS scheme, the proposed scheme yields more adaptive
trajectories and significantly mitigates performance degradation caused by ARIS
tilting, demonstrating strong potential for practical ARIS deployment.

*Richard Csaky*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本论文研究了使用深度学习方法对脑电图（EEG）和脑磁图（MEG）等无创脑电生理信号进行建模和解码，以理解视觉感知和内在言语的神经机制，并提高解码性能。研究结果表明，Transformer模型在预测MEG数据方面表现出色，但内在言语的解码仍然具有挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大脑在感知视觉刺激或进行内在言语时的活动，并提高相关神经信号的解码性能。

Method: 探索深度学习在脑解码中的应用，提出处理被试间变异性的新方法，并开发基于卷积和Transformer的MEG数据预测模型。实验部分收集了内在言语的EEG、MEG和OPM数据。

Result: Transformer模型在生成与真实脑数据匹配的信号方面表现出优越能力。内在言语解码结果大部分为阴性，表明解码内在言语的困难。

Conclusion: 尽管Transformer模型在MEG数据建模方面取得进展，但内在言语的解码仍然是一个重大挑战。

Abstract: This thesis delves into the world of non-invasive electrophysiological brain
signals like electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG),
focusing on modelling and decoding such data. The research aims to investigate
what happens in the brain when we perceive visual stimuli or engage in covert
speech (inner speech) and enhance the decoding performance of such stimuli. The
thesis is divided into two main sections, methodological and experimental work.
A central concern in both sections is the large variability present in
electrophysiological recordings, whether it be within-subject or
between-subject variability, and to a certain extent between-dataset
variability. In the methodological sections, we explore the potential of deep
learning for brain decoding. We present advancements in decoding visual stimuli
using linear models at the individual subject level. We then explore how deep
learning techniques can be employed for group decoding, introducing new methods
to deal with between-subject variability. Finally, we also explores novel
forecasting models of MEG data based on convolutional and Transformer-based
architectures. In particular, Transformer-based models demonstrate superior
capabilities in generating signals that closely match real brain data, thereby
enhancing the accuracy and reliability of modelling the brain's
electrophysiology. In the experimental section, we present a unique dataset
containing high-trial inner speech EEG, MEG, and preliminary optically pumped
magnetometer (OPM) data. Our aim is to investigate different types of inner
speech and push decoding performance by collecting a high number of trials and
sessions from a few participants. However, the decoding results are found to be
mostly negative, underscoring the difficulty of decoding inner speech.

*Tianheng Ling,Chao Qian,Peter Zdankin,Torben Weis,Gregor Schiele*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为StrikeWatch的腕戴式系统，能够完全在设备端实时识别跑步步态，解决了现有可穿戴设备在步态分析中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跑步虽有益健康，但错误步态易致伤，而现有分析系统（如相机、鞋垫、身体传感器）存在笨重、仅支持离线分析等问题。腕戴式设备更实用，但实时步态识别面临信号噪声、计算资源有限和依赖云连接的挑战。

Method: 提出四种紧凑型深度学习模型（1D-CNN, 1D-SepCNN, LSTM, Transformer），并针对AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15和Lattice iCE40UP5K两种嵌入式FPGA优化，实现节能推理。收集户外跑步数据集，并通过全自动化部署流程进行评估。

Conclusion: StrikeWatch系统实现了在资源受限的腕戴式设备上进行高效、实时的步态识别，为跑步者提供了自我纠正步态的可能，并且其低功耗特性使其具有出色的续航能力。

Abstract: Running offers substantial health benefits, but improper gait patterns can
lead to injuries, particularly without expert feedback. While prior gait
analysis systems based on cameras, insoles, or body-mounted sensors have
demonstrated effectiveness, they are often bulky and limited to offline,
post-run analysis. Wrist-worn wearables offer a more practical and
non-intrusive alternative, yet enabling real-time gait recognition on such
devices remains challenging due to noisy Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
signals, limited computing resources, and dependence on cloud connectivity.
This paper introduces StrikeWatch, a compact wrist-worn system that performs
entirely on-device, real-time gait recognition using IMU signals. As a case
study, we target the detection of heel versus forefoot strikes to enable
runners to self-correct harmful gait patterns through visual and auditory
feedback during running. We propose four compact DL architectures (1D-CNN,
1D-SepCNN, LSTM, and Transformer) and optimize them for energy-efficient
inference on two representative embedded Field-Programmable Gate Arrays
(FPGAs): the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 and the Lattice iCE40UP5K. Using our
custom-built hardware prototype, we collect a labeled dataset from outdoor
running sessions and evaluate all models via a fully automated deployment
pipeline. Our results reveal clear trade-offs between model complexity and
hardware efficiency. Evaluated across 12 participants, 6-bit quantized
1D-SepCNN achieves the highest average F1 score of 0.847 while consuming just
0.350 {\mu}J per inference with a latency of 0.140 ms on the iCE40UP5K running
at 20 MHz. This configuration supports up to 13.6 days of continuous inference
on a 320 mAh battery. All datasets and code are available in the GitHub
repository https://github.com/tianheng-ling/StrikeWatch.

### [8] [Comparative Analysis of Data Augmentation for Clinical ECG Classification with STAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24740)
*Nader Nemati*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Sinusoidal Time--Amplitude Resampling (STAR) 是一种新的心电图增强技术，可以在不损害诊断信息的情况下提高模型在不同设备和数据集上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床12导联心电图分类因记录条件多样、病理重叠和标签不平衡而难以泛化，而无约束的增强方法可能扭曲关键的形态学信息。

Method: STAR 是一种逐搏增强技术，在连续 R波峰之间进行，可以控制时间扭曲和幅度缩放，同时保持 P-QRS-T 的顺序和波形的头部尾部不变。它具有保持形态的变异性、提高跨源的鲁棒性、易于集成到现有模型以及改善稀有类别的学习效果等优点。

Result: STAR 避免了破坏临床标志物的全局裁剪、大位移或加性噪声等变换。作者发布了完整的 Python 实现和透明的训练流程，并在多机构 12 导联数据集上进行了五折交叉验证。

Conclusion: STAR 是一种简单且可控的心电图分类增强方法，适用于需要可信形态学、操作简单和跨源耐用性的场景。

Abstract: Clinical 12-lead ECG classification remains difficult because of diverse
recording conditions, overlapping pathologies, and pronounced label imbalance
hinder generalization, while unconstrained augmentations risk distorting
diagnostically critical morphology. In this study, Sinusoidal Time--Amplitude
Resampling (STAR) is introduced as a beat-wise augmentation that operates
strictly between successive R-peaks to apply controlled time warping and
amplitude scaling to each R--R segment, preserving the canonical P--QRS--T
order and leaving the head and tail of the trace unchanged. STAR is designed
for practical pipelines and offers: (i) morphology-faithful variability that
broadens training diversity without corrupting peaks or intervals; (ii)
source-resilient training, improving stability across devices, sites, and
cohorts without dataset-specific tuning; (iii) model-agnostic integration with
common 1D SE--ResNet-style ECG encoders backbone; and (iv) better learning on
rare classes via beat-level augmentation, reducing overfitting by resampling
informative beats instead of duplicating whole records. In contrast to global
crops, large shifts, or additive noise, STAR avoids transformations that
suppress or misalign clinical landmarks. A complete Python implementation and a
transparent training workflow are released, aligned with a source-aware,
stratified five-fold protocol over a multi-institutional 12-lead corpus,
thereby facilitating inspection and reuse. Taken together, STAR provides a
simple and controllable augmentation for clinical ECG classification where
trustworthy morphology, operational simplicity, and cross-source durability are
essential.

Abstract: Non-intrusive monitoring of vital signs has become increasingly important in
a variety of healthcare settings. In this paper, we present PulseFi, a novel
low-cost non-intrusive system that uses Wi-Fi sensing and artificial
intelligence to accurately and continuously monitor heart rate and breathing
rate, as well as detect apnea events. PulseFi operates using low-cost commodity
devices, making it more accessible and cost-effective. It uses a signal
processing pipeline to process Wi-Fi telemetry data, specifically Channel State
Information (CSI), that is fed into a custom low-compute Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) neural network model. We evaluate PulseFi using two datasets: one that
we collected locally using ESP32 devices and another that contains recordings
of 118 participants collected using the Raspberry Pi 4B, making the latter the
most comprehensive data set of its kind. Our results show that PulseFi can
effectively estimate heart rate and breathing rate in a seemless non-intrusive
way with comparable or better accuracy than multiple antenna systems that can
be expensive and less accessible.

### [10] [EcoScaleNet: A Lightweight Multi Kernel Network for Long Sequence 12 lead ECG Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24748)
*Dong-Hyeon Kang,Ju-Hyeon Nam,Sang-Chul Lee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: EcoScale-Net通过引入分层结构和瓶颈卷积，在保持全感受野覆盖的同时，大幅降低了计算成本和参数量，并在ECG分类任务上取得了SOTA准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动解读心电图（ECG）易出错，现有的基于CNN的分类器在处理ECG长序列时难以选择合适的感受野尺寸，导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出了一种名为EcoScale-Net的分层变体，它在OS CNN的基础上进行改进。通过在每个阶段将最大卷积核长度限制在下采样后仍需要的尺度，并插入瓶颈卷积来控制通道增长和融合多尺度特征，从而在保留完整感受野的同时消除了冗余。

Result: 在CODE 15% ECG数据集上，EcoScaleNet的参数量减少了90%，计算量减少了99%，同时宏平均F1分数提高了2.4%，达到了SOTA水平。

Conclusion: EcoScaleNet在以计算成本极低的优势实现了长序列ECG分类的SOTA准确率，能够满足在普通硬件上进行实时部署的需求。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of 12 lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for
early detection of cardiac abnormalities, yet manual reading is error prone and
existing CNN based classifiers struggle to choose receptive field sizes that
generalize to the long sequences typical of ECGs. Omni Scale CNN (OS CNN)
addresses this by enumerating prime sized kernels inspired by Goldbach
conjecture to cover every scale, but its exhaustive design explodes
computational cost and blocks deeper, wider models. We present Efficient
Convolutional Omni Scale Network (EcoScale-Net), a hierarchical variant that
retains full receptive field coverage while eliminating redundancy. At each
stage, the maximum kernel length is capped to the scale still required after
down sampling, and bottleneck convolutions inserted before and after every Omni
Scale block curtail channel growth and fuse multi scale features. On the large
scale CODE 15% ECG dataset, EcoScaleNet reduces parameters by 90% and FLOPs by
99% compared with OS CNN, while raising macro averaged F1 score by 2.4%. These
results demonstrate that EcoScaleNet delivers SOTA accuracy for long sequence
ECG classification at a fraction of the computational cost, enabling real time
deployment on commodity hardware. Our EcoScaleNet code is available in GitHub
Link.

TL;DR: 该研究表明，单导联人工智能心电图（AI-ECG）系统能够有效地筛查 Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) 综合征，显著减轻了医生的工作负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的 WPW 综合征筛查方法（电生理检查或 12 导联心电图）难以实现大规模、经济高效的筛查。本研究旨在评估先前开发的单导联 AI-ECG 移动系统在现实世界中筛查 WPW 综合征的效率和有效性。

Method: 本研究纳入了 3,566,626 条来自中国 87,836 名个体的单导联心电图记录，使用 NMPA 批准的便携式心电设备。通过心脏病专家标注和随机抽样验证 AI 系统的性能，并量化 AI 辅助减轻的工作量，比较了不同工作流程下的审查效率。

Result: AI 系统实现了 45.5% 的敏感性和 95.9% 的特异性。AI 阳性结果表明确诊 WPW 的风险增加了约 210 倍。通过 AI 筛选阳性结果，医生工作量减少了 99.5%，平均只需审查 12 例即可确认 1 例 WPW 病例，而广泛人群和用户驱动的方法则需要 909 例和 875 例。

Conclusion: 这项大规模的真实世界研究证明，单导联 AI-ECG 系统能够实现 WPW 综合征的有效、便捷的筛查，显著减轻医生工作负担，有助于心血管疾病的预防。

Abstract: Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a congenital cardiac condition
associated with sudden cardiac death, with a prevalence of 0.1-0.3%.
Conventional screening relies on electrophysiological testing or 12-lead
electrocardiography interpreted by cardiologists, which limits large-scale and
cost-effective screening. Building on our previous work developing a
single-lead AI-ECG mobile system for atrial fibrillation screening, this study
evaluates its efficiency and effectiveness for opportunistic detection of WPW
syndrome in real-world settings. This retrospective analysis included 3,566,626
single-lead ECG recordings from 87,836 individuals in China, collected using
the NMPA-approved portable ECG device WenXinWuYang. The AI system performance
was validated using cardiologist annotations and random sampling. We quantified
AI-assisted workload reduction and compared review efficiency across
AI-positive and user-initiated workflows. The AI system achieved 45.5%
sensitivity and 95.9% specificity. A positive AI result indicated about 210
times higher risk of confirmed WPW. Focusing on AI-selected positives reduced
physician workload by 99.5%, requiring only 12 reviews to confirm one WPW case,
compared with 909 and 875 in population-wide and user-driven approaches. In
conclusion, this large-scale real-world study demonstrates that a single-lead
AI-ECG system enables efficient and practical opportunistic screening for WPW
syndrome, significantly reducing physician workload and supporting
population-based cardiovascular prevention.

Method: 提出了一种基于圆柱纳米线阵列的Flexure-FET MC接收器，并采用悬挂栅极配置，通过分析模型表征其机电响应、噪声行为和信息论性能（如SNR和信道容量）。

Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) enables biocompatible and energy-efficient
information transfer through chemical signaling, forming a foundational
paradigm for emerging applications in the Internet of Nano Things (IoNT) and
intrabody healthcare systems. The realization of this vision critically depends
on developing advanced receiver architectures that merge nanoscale
communication and networking techniques with bio-cyber interfaces, ensuring
energy-efficient, reliable, and low-complexity modulation and detection while
maintaining biocompatibility. To address these challenges, the Flexure-FET MC
receiver was introduced as a mechanically transducing design capable of
detecting both charged and neutral molecular species. In this study, we present
a cylindrical nanowire array-based Flexure-FET MC receiver that enhances design
versatility and scalability through distributed electromechanical coupling in a
suspended-gate configuration. The proposed array architecture offers additional
geometric degrees of freedom, including nanowire radius, length, spacing, and

scenarios. An analytical end-to-end model is developed to characterize the
system's electromechanical response, noise behavior, and information-theoretic
performance, including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and channel capacity. The
results reveal the strong interdependence between geometry, electromechanical
dynamics, and molecular binding processes, enabling tunable control over
sensitivity, noise characteristics, and communication capacity. The enhanced
structural tunability and array configuration of the proposed design provide a
flexible foundation for future mixture-based and spatially modulated MC
systems, paving the way toward scalable and multifunctional receiver
architectures within the IoNT framework.

TL;DR: DyFrag-MAC是一种动态碎片化MAC协议，通过动态分割低优先级数据包以支持高优先级数据的提前传输，在工业CPS环境中实现了比现有协议（如FROG-MAC和i-DSME）更优的延迟和吞吐量性能。

Motivation: 工业网络物理系统（CPS）需要支持具有不同优先级的异构应用程序，并期望可靠、及时的网络服务，因为连接设备的数量预计将显著增长。

Method: 提出了一种名为动态碎片化MAC（DyFrag-MAC）的新型方案，通过动态分割普通优先级数据来支持紧急优先级数据的早期传输。

Result: 与FROG-MAC和i-DSME相比，DyFrag-MAC在延迟和吞吐量方面表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: DyFrag-MAC通过动态分割普通优先级数据包以支持紧急优先级数据的提前传输，为工业CPS提供了更优的性能。

Abstract: Next Generation Media Access Control (NGMA) techniques have been designed to
support diverse applications with heterogeneous priorities. In industrial
cyber-physical systems (CPS), the number of connected devices and systems is
expected to grow significantly, demanding dependable and prompt network
services. In this work, we present a novel scheme, Dynamic Fragmentation-MAC
(DyFrag-MAC) that offers dynamic, differentiated channel access to the traffic
of various priorities. DyFrag-MAC works on fragmenting the data of normal
priority in order to support early delivery of urgent priority data. In prior
work, urgent priority data either had to wait for the complete transmission of
lower-priority packets or relied on multi-channel protocols to gain access. We
compared the proposed fragmentation scheme with FROG-MAC and industrial
Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-channel Extension (i-DSME). FROG-MAC
fragmented the lower priority packets, but did not adjust the fragment size
dynamically, whereas i-DSME utilized multiple channels and adaptive contention
mechanisms; both protocols lack the ability to preempt ongoing lower-priority
transmissions. Hence, the performance evaluation in terms of average delay and
throughput reveals better performance of DyFRAG-MAC for the heterogeneous
traffic.

TL;DR: ADP2-MAC是一种新颖的基于优先级的MAC协议，通过概率性轮询间隔和中断机制，在WBAN中实现了对不同优先级流量的高效管理，优于MVDR协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无线体域网（WBAN）中，对具有不同优先级的异构流量进行有效管理至关重要，而MAC协议中的优先级机制直接影响着WBAN的可靠性、延迟和能效。最小化数据包的生成和接收延迟对提高WBAN性能和健康结果至关重要，但延迟优化需要针对每种流量优先级进行定制。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的基于优先级的MAC协议，称为自适应动态轮询MAC（ADP2-MAC），该协议利用概率方法动态确定信道轮询/监听间隔，识别流量到达模式以确定最佳轮询间隔，并在预期有紧急数据包时中断低优先级数据传输。

Result: 与支持异构流量的MAC协议（MVDR）相比，ADP2-MAC表现出更优越的性能，因为它采用了概率性轮询间隔和中断机制来高效处理紧急优先级数据。

Conclusion: ADP2-MAC通过其创新的概率性轮询和中断机制，在处理WBAN中的异构流量方面，尤其是在需要低延迟和高可靠性的紧急医疗场景下，提供了比现有协议（如MVDR）更优的性能。

Abstract: Efficient management of heterogeneous traffic with varying priorities is
critical in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). The priority mechanisms
embedded in Media Access Control (MAC) schemes largely govern the performance
of WBAN in terms of reliability, delay and energy efficiency. Minimizing the
delay between packet generation and reception is critical for enhancing WBAN
performance and associated health outcomes; however, delay optimization must be
tailored to each traffic priority. In this work, we proposed a novel
priority-based MAC protocol, Adaptive and Dynamic Polling MAC for Prioritized
Traffic (ADP2-MAC), designed to support heterogeneous traffic in WBANs. The
protocol utilizes a probabilistic approach to dynamically determine channel
polling/listening intervals. ADP2-MAC not only identifies traffic arrival
patterns to determine optimal polling intervals but also interrupts the
transmission of lower-priority data when urgent packets are expected. The
performance of ADP2-MAC has been compared with the MAC protocol for Variable
Data Rates (MVDR) which supports heterogeneous traffic by assigning different
data rates based on traffic priority. ADP2-MAC outperforms MVDR due to its use
of probabilistic polling intervals and an interruption mechanism designed to
efficiently handle urgent-priority data.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of tracking maneuvering objects with complex
motion patterns, a task in which conventional methods often struggle due to
their reliance on predefined motion models. We integrate a data-driven liquid
neural network (LNN) into the random finite set (RFS) framework, leading to two
LNN-RFS filters. By learning continuous-time dynamics directly from data, the
LNN enables the filters to adapt to complex, nonlinear motion and achieve
accurate tracking of highly maneuvering objects in clutter. This hybrid
approach preserves the inherent multi-object tracking strengths of the RFS
framework while improving flexibility and robustness. Simulation results on
challenging maneuvering scenarios demonstrate substantial gains of the proposed
hybrid approach in tracking accuracy.

Motivation: 为了在捏合天线系统（PASS）中实现频谱效率（SE）和能源效率（EE）之间的权衡，并解决单用户和多用户通信场景下的联合波束成形设计问题。

Method: 在单用户场景下，提出了一种两阶段联合波束成形设计：第一阶段，提出一种迭代闭式精炼（ICR）方案来对齐接收信号相位，并提出一个 PA 放置框架；第二阶段，在给定最优 PA 位置的情况下，推导出最优发射波束形成的闭式解。在多用户场景下，提出了一种基于交替优化（AO）的联合波束成形设计。

Conclusion: 所提出的联合发射和捏合波束成形设计能够有效优化 PASS 系统的 SE-EE 性能，并具有良好的收敛性和性能优势。

Abstract: The joint transmit and pinching beamforming design for spectral efficiency
(SE) and energy efficiency (EE) tradeoff in pinching-antenna systems (PASS) is
proposed. Both PASS-enabled single- and multi-user communications are
considered. In the single-user scenario, it is proved that the optimal pinching
antenna (PA) positions are independent of the transmit beamforming. Based on
this insight, a two-stage joint beamforming design is proposed. Specifically,
in the first stage, an iterative closed-form refinement (ICR) scheme is
proposed to align the phases of the received signals, based on which a PA
placement framework is proposed. In the second stage, the closed-form solution
for the optimal transmit beamformer is derived given the optimal PA positions.
In the multi-user scenario, an alternating optimization (AO)-based joint
beamforming design is proposed to balance the SE-EE performance while taking
the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements into account. It is proved that the
proposed AO-based algorithm is guaranteed to converge when no constraints are
violated in PA placement subproblem. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) the
proposed algorithms significantly improve joint SE-EE performance with fast
convergence speed; 2) the SE-EE tradeoff regime gap between PASS and
conventional multi-antenna system widens as the number of PAs and service
coverage increase.

Abstract: Accurate direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for sound sources is
challenging due to the continuous changes in acoustic characteristics across
time and frequency. In such scenarios, accurate localization relies on the
ability to aggregate relevant features and model temporal dependencies
effectively. In time series modeling, achieving a balance between model
performance and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. To
address this, we propose FA-Stateformer, a state space and self-attention
collaborative network with feature aggregation. The proposed network first
employs a feature aggregation module to enhance informative features across
both temporal and spectral dimensions. This is followed by a lightweight
Conformer architecture inspired by the squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, where
the feedforward layers are compressed to reduce redundancy and parameter
overhead. Additionally, a temporal shift mechanism is incorporated to expand
the receptive field of convolutional layers while maintaining a compact kernel
size. To further enhance sequence modeling capabilities, a bidirectional Mamba
module is introduced, enabling efficient state-space-based representation of
temporal dependencies in both forward and backward directions. The remaining
self-attention layers are combined with the Mamba blocks, forming a
collaborative modeling framework that achieves a balance between representation
capacity and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FA-Stateformer achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to
conventional architectures.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising solution for the
future sixth-generation (6G) system. However, classical fixed-position antenna
(FPA) ISAC systems fail to fully utilize spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs),
resulting in limited gains for both radar sensing and communication
functionalities. This challenge can be addressed by the emerging novel movable
antenna (MA) technology, which can pursue better channel conditions and improve
sensing and communication performances. In this paper, we aim to minimize the
Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target's angle while guaranteeing
communication performance. This involves jointly optimizing active beamforming,
power allocation, receiving filters, and MA position configurations, which is a
highly non-convex problem. To tackle this difficulty, we propose an efficient
iterative solution that analytically optimizes all variables without relying on
numerical solvers, i.e., CVX. Specifically, by leveraging cutting-edge
majorization-minimization (MM) and penalty-dual-decomposition (PDD) methods, we
develop a low-complexity algorithm to solve the beamformer configuration
problem containing the fractional and quartic terms. Numerical simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm,
highlighting significant performance improvements achieved by employing MA in
the ISAC system.

Abstract: This paper explores a multi-cell multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink
communication system enabled by a unique transmissive reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS) transceiver (TRTC) configuration. Within this system
framework, we formulate an optimization problem for the purpose of maximizing
the minimum rate of users for each cell via designing the transmit beamforming
of the TRTC, subject to the power constraints of each TRTC unit. Since the
objective function is non-differentiable, the max-min rate problem is difficult
to solve. In order to tackle this challenging optimization problem, an
efficient low-complexity optimization algorithm is developed. Specifically, the
log-form rate function is transformed into a tractable form by employing the
fractional programming (FP) methodology. Next, the max-min objective function
can be approximated using a differentiable function derived from smooth
approximation theory. Moreover, by applying the majorization-minimization (MM)
technique and examining the optimality conditions, a solution is proposed that
updates all variables analytically without relying on any numerical solvers.
Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the convergence and
effectiveness of the proposed low-complexity algorithm. Additionally, the
algorithm can significantly reduce the computational complexity without
performance loss. Furthermore, the simulation results illustrate the clear
superiority of the deployment of the TRTC over the benchmark schemes.

Abstract: This study demonstrates the feasibility of radar-based non-contact
respiratory monitoring for wombats. Two measurement experiments were conducted
in June and December 2024 using 79-GHz millimeter-wave radar systems to monitor
the respiration of two wombats. To estimate the respiratory interval, we used a
method based on summing harmonic components in the autocorrelation function,
capturing the quasi-periodic displacement of the body surface caused by
respiration. Estimation accuracy was evaluated through simultaneous
measurements from different angles using two radar units. The respiratory
interval and respiratory rate were measured with errors of 47.4 ms (2.44%) and
0.81 bpm (2.21%), respectively. We also discuss the differences in respiratory
rates between the two wombats, as well as seasonal variations between June and
December. The results support the potential application of this method to
non-contact health monitoring of wombats.

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical for current and
next-generation multi-antenna systems. Yet conventional pilot-based estimators
incur prohibitive overhead as antenna counts grow. In this paper, we address
this challenge by developing a novel framework based on Gaussian process
regression (GPR) that predicts full CSI from only a few observed entries,
thereby reducing pilot overhead. The correlation between data points in GPR is
defined by the covariance function, known as kernels. In the proposed GPR-based
CSI estimation framework, we incorporate three kernels, i.e., radial basis
function, Mat\'ern, and rational quadratic, to model smooth and multi-scale
spatial correlations derived from the antenna array geometry. The proposed
approach is evaluated across Kronecker and Weichselberger channel models with
three distinct pilot probing schemes. Results show that the proposed GPR with
50% pilot saving achieves the lowest prediction error, the highest empirical
95% credible-interval coverage, and the best preservation of mutual information
relative to benchmarks. This enables up to 50% pilot reduction while preserving
over 92% of the link capacity.

Abstract: Satellite-based communications are expected to be a substantial future market
in 6G networks. As satellite constellations grow denser and transmission
resources remain limited, frequency reuse plays an increasingly important role
in managing inter-user interference. In the multi-user downlink, precoding
enables the reuse of frequencies across spatially separated users, greatly
improving spectral efficiency. The analytical calculation of suitable
precodings for perfect channel information is well studied, however, their
performance can quickly deteriorate when faced with, e.g., outdated channel
state information or, as is particularly relevant for satellite channels, when
position estimates are erroneous. Deriving robust precoders under imperfect
channel state information is not only analytically intractable in general but
often requires substantial relaxations of the optimization problem or heuristic
constraints to obtain feasible solutions. Instead, in this paper we flexibly
derive robust precoding algorithms from given data using reinforcement
learning. We describe how we adapt the applied Soft Actor-Critic learning
algorithm to the problem of downlink satellite beamforming and show numerically
that the resulting precoding algorithm adjusts to all investigated scenarios.
The considered scenarios cover both single satellite and cooperative
multi-satellite beamforming, using either global or local channel state
information, and two error models that represent increasing levels of
uncertainty. We show that the learned algorithms match or markedly outperform
two analytical baselines in sum rate performance, adapting to the required
level of robustness. We also analyze the mechanisms that the learned algorithms
leverage to achieve robustness. The implementation is publicly available for
use and reproduction of the results.

Abstract: The advent of artificial intelligence (AI)-native wireless communication is
fundamentally reshaping the design paradigm of next-generation (NextG) systems,
where intelligent air interfaces are expected to operate adaptively and
efficiently in highly dynamic environments. Conventional orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) systems rely heavily on pilots and the cyclic
prefix (CP), resulting in significant overhead and reduced spectral efficiency.
To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive end-to-end (E2E)
transceiver architecture tailored for pilot-free and CP-free wireless systems.
The architecture combines AI-driven constellation shaping and a neural receiver
through joint training. To enhance robustness against mismatched or
time-varying channel conditions, we introduce a lightweight channel adapter
(CA) module, which enables rapid adaptation with minimal computational overhead
by updating only the CA parameters. Additionally, we present a framework that
is scalable to multiple modulation orders within a unified model, significantly
reducing model storage requirements. Moreover, to tackle the high
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) inherent to OFDM, we incorporate constrained
E2E training, achieving compliance with PAPR targets without additional
transmission overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
framework delivers superior bit error rate (BER), throughput, and resilience
across diverse channel scenarios, highlighting its potential for AI-native
NextG.

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) band is considered a promising candidate to meet the
high-throughput requirement for future sixth-generation (6G) wireless
communications due to its ultrawide bandwidth. However, due to the high
penetration loss at high-frequencies, blockage becomes a serious problem in THz
communications, especially in near-field indoor communications with numerous
obstacles. To address this issue, this paper investigates blockage-resilient
near-field beam training based on self-accelerating Airy beam, which can
propagate along a curved trajectory to circumvent obstacles. Specifically, we
first analyze the trajectory of the Airy beam and the beam pattern at the
receiver using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook in the presence of
obstacles. Interestingly, we reveal that the beam pattern not only captures the
receiver's location information but also implicitly encodes the spatial
relationship between the receiver and obstacle, which facilitates identifying
the optimal Airy beam configuration. Based on this insight, we formulate the
blockage-resilient beam training task as a multitask learning problem and
propose a lightweight attention-based multi-parameter beam training network
(AMPBT-Net) to jointly predict the angle, distance, and curvature parameters of
the optimal Airy beam based on the beam pattern. Finally, simulation results
demonstrate that the Airy beam effectively mitigates blockage effects and the
proposed scheme achieves comparable performance to exhaustive beam sweeping
while significantly reducing training overhead.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a dynamic radio frequency sensing system aiming to
spatially track multiple targets over time. We develop a conditional denoising
diffusion probabilistic model (C-DDPM)-assisted framework that learns the
temporal evolution of target parameters by leveraging the noisy echo
observations as conditioning features. The proposed framework integrates a
variational autoencoder (VAE) for echo compression and utilizes classifier-free
guidance to enhance conditional denoising. In each transmission block, VAE
encodes the received echo into a latent representation that conditions DDPM to
predict future target states, which are then used for codebook beam selection.
Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms classical signal
processing, filtering, and deep learning benchmarks. The C-DDPM-assisted
framework achieves significantly lower estimation errors in both angle and
distance tracking, demonstrating the potential of generative models for
integrated sensing and communications.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified modeling, estimation, and feedback framework
for reconfigurable intelligent surface RIS-assisted optical wireless links. The
key modeling element is a long-exposure pixel gain that extends the classical
diffraction-limited response by statistically averaging angular jitter and
mispointing; it admits an exact real-integral form and captures boresight
attenuation and progressive sidelobe filling. The end-to-end system couples
free-space path loss, Beer--Lambert atmospheric extinction, pixel-level
diffraction, and optical efficiency with a unitary-pilot least-squares channel
estimator and quantized phase feedback. Analysis closely matches Monte Carlo
simulations and yields concrete design rules: with a surface of N=64 pixels,
pilot length $M=2N$, and pilot SNR=20 dB, the normalized mean-squared error
is0.005, implying an effective-SNR loss of about 0.5 and a capacity penalty of
0.007bits-s. Six-bit phase quantization introduces no measurable additional
penalty at these operating points, setting a practical benchmark for feedback
resolution. Training overhead scales strongly with pixel geometry: halving
pixel width (quartering pixel area) increases the pilot length required to
maintain the same NMSE by roughly fourfold. The framework reconciles
physical-optics modeling with estimation-and-feedback design and provides a
principled basis for scalable link budgeting in RIS-assisted optical networks.

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key enabler in 6G networks,
where sensing and communication capabilities are designed to complement and
enhance each other. One of the main challenges in ISAC lies in resource
allocation, which becomes computationally demanding in dynamic environments
requiring real-time adaptation. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL)-based approach for dynamic beamforming and power allocation in
ISAC systems. The DRL agent interacts with the environment and learns optimal
strategies through trial and error, guided by predefined rewards. Simulation
results show that the DRL-based solution converges within 2000 episodes and
achieves up to 80\% of the spectral efficiency of a semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) benchmark. More importantly, it offers a significant improvement in
runtime performance, achieving decision times of around 20 ms compared to 4500
ms for the SDR method. Furthermore, compared with a Deep Q-Network (DQN)
benchmark employing discrete beamforming, the proposed approach achieves
approximately 30\% higher sum-rate with comparable runtime. These results
highlight the potential of DRL for enabling real-time, high-performance ISAC in
dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Motivated by Industry 4.0 applications, we consider quickest change detection
(QCD) of an abrupt change in a process when its measurements are transmitted by
a sensor over a lossy wireless link to a decision maker (DM). The sensor node
samples measurements using a Bernoulli sampling process, and places the
measurement samples in the transmit queue of its transmitter. The transmitter
uses a retransmit-until-success transmission strategy to deliver packets to the
DM over the lossy link, in which the packet losses are modeled as a Bernoulli
process, with different loss probabilities before and after the change. We pose
the QCD problem in the non-Bayesian setting under Lorden's framework, and
propose a CUSUM algorithm. By defining a suitable Markov process, involving the
DM measurements and the queue length process, we show that the problem reduces
to QCD in a Markov process. Characterizing the information measure per
measurement sample at the DM, we establish the asymptotic optimality of our
algorithm when the false alarm rate tends to zero. Further, when the DM
receives incomplete data due to channel loss, we present asymptotically optimal
QCD algorithms by suitably modifying the CUSUM algorithm. We then explore the
last-come-first-served (LCFS) queuing discipline at the sensor transmit queue
to lower detection delay in the non-asymptotic case. Next, we consider the case
of multiple sensors, each with its own wireless transmitter queue, and show
that our analysis extends to the case of multiple homogeneous sensors. When the
sensors are heterogeneous, we present a sensor scheduling algorithm that
minimizes detection delay by balancing the trade-off between the age of the
observations and their information content. Numerical analysis demonstrate
trade-offs that can be used to optimize system design parameters in the
non-asymptotic regime.

Abstract: Estimating subsurface dielectric properties is essential for applications
ranging from environmental surveys of soils to nondestructive evaluation of
concrete in infrastructure. Conventional wave inversion methods typically
assume few discrete homogeneous layers and require dense measurements or strong
prior knowledge of material boundaries, limiting scalability and accuracy in
realistic settings where properties vary continuously. We present a physics
informed machine learning framework that reconstructs subsurface permittivity
as a fully neural, continuous function of depth, trained to satisfy both
measurement data and Maxwells equations. We validate the framework with both
simulations and custom built radar experiments on multilayered natural
materials. Results show close agreement with in-situ permittivity measurements
(R^2=0.93), with sensitivity to even subtle variations (Delta eps_r=2).
Parametric analysis reveals that accurate profiles can be recovered with as few
as three strategically placed sensors in two layer systems. This approach
reframes subsurface inversion from boundary-driven to continuous property
estimation, enabling accurate characterization of smooth permittivity
variations and advancing electromagnetic imaging using low cost radar systems.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) are a widely used tool in time series analysis. In
the complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ
particle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the
hidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle
filtering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of
the system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based
optimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle
filters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several
recently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering
differentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such
differentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular
PyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible
to a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison
between them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several
existing studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several
common challenges with state space modelling.

Abstract: This paper proposes a noncoherent low probability of detection (LPD)
communication system based on direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and
Grassmannian signaling. Grassmannian constellations enhance covertness because
they tend to follow a noise-like distribution. Simulations showed that
Grassmannian signaling provides competitive bit error rates (BER) at low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes with low probability of detection at the
unintended receiver compared to coherent schemes that use QPSK or QAM
modulation formats and need pilots to perform channel estimation. The results
suggest the practicality and security benefits of noncoherent Grassmannian
signaling for LPD communications due to their improved covertness and
performance.
