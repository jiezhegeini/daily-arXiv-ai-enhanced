It is demonstrated that a first-order HMM\nprovides a natural framework for the decoder. The HMM is time-homogeneous with\na fixed transition matrix and is based on a random walk through the encoded\nframe bits. Each hidden state contains a pair of two encoded bits, and parity\nchecks are naturally incorporated into the observation model. The paper shows\nthat by implementing a forward-backward smoothing estimator for the hidden\nstates, decoding is efficient and requires only a small number of iterations in\nmost cases. The results show that the LDPC decoding threshold is significantly\nimproved compared to belief propagation (BP) on a Tanner graph. Numerical\nresults are presented showing that LDPC codes under the proposed decoder yield\na frame error rate (FER) and decoding threshold comparable to that of a Polar\ncode where Successive Cancellation List (SCL) - Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)\ndecoding is deployed. This is shown to be achieved even if the frame length is\nshort (on the order of $512$ bits or less) and a regular LDPC code is used. 1"}

Unlike\nexisting DNN-based nulling control beamforming (NCBF) methods that face\nscalability and complexity challenges, the proposed framework partitions the\nFresnel region using correlation-based sampling and assigns a lightweight fully\nconnected DNN model to each subsection. Each model is trained on beamforming\nweights generated using the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV)\nmethod, enabling accurate prediction of nulling control beam-focusing weights\nthat simultaneously optimize the desired signal strength and suppress potential\ninterference for both collinear and non-collinear user configurations.\nSimulation results show that the trained models achieve average phase and\nmagnitude prediction errors of 0.085 radians and 0.52 dB, respectively, across\n75 sample subsections. Full-wave simulations in Ansys HFSS further demonstrate\nthat the proposed DNN codebook achieves interference suppression better than\n31.64 dB, with a performance gap within 2 dB of the LCMV method, thereby\nvalidating its effectiveness in mitigating MUI while reducing computational\ncomplexity."}

To address both challenges, we develop a\nSIM-enhanced wideband multiuser transceiver built on orthogonal\nfrequency-division multiplexing with index modulation (OFDM-IM). The sparse\nactivation of OFDM-IM confines high-fidelity equalization to the active tones,\neffectively widening the usable bandwidth. To make the design\nreliability-aware, we directly target the worst-link bit-error rate (BER) and\nadopt a max-min per-tone signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as a\nprincipled surrogate, turning the reliability optimization tractable. For\nframe-rate inference and interpretability, we propose an unfolded\nprojected-gradient-descent network (UPGD-Net) that double-unrolls across the\nSIM's layers and algorithmic iterations: each cell computes the analytic\ngradient from the cascaded precoder with a learnable per-iteration step size.\nSimulations on wideband multiuser downlinks show fast, monotone convergence, an\nevident layer-depth sweet spot, and consistent gains in worst-link BER and sum\nrate. By combining structural sparsity with a BER-driven, deep-unfolded\noptimization backbone, the proposed framework directly addresses the key\nwideband deficiencies of SIM."}

However, existing approaches fail to\naddress scenarios where signals from multiple emitters overlap. In this paper,\nwe propose a specific multi-emitter identification (SMEI) method via\nmulti-label learning to determine multiple transmitters. Specifically, the\nmulti-emitter fingerprint extractor is designed to mitigate the mutual\ninterference among overlapping signals. Then, the multi-emitter decision maker\nis proposed to assign the all emitter identification using the previous\nextracted fingerprint. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with\nbaseline approach, the proposed SMEI scheme achieves comparable identification\naccuracy under various overlapping conditions, while operating at significantly\nlower complexity. The significance of this paper is to identify multiple\nemitters from overlapped signal with a low complexity."}
