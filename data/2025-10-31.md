Abstract: Accurate, real-time wireless signal prediction is essential for
next-generation networks. However, existing vision-based frameworks often rely
on computationally intensive models and are also sensitive to environmental
interference. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, physics-guided
and light-weighted framework that predicts the received signal strength
indicator (RSSI) from camera images. By decomposing RSSI into its physically
interpretable components, path loss and shadow fading, we significantly reduce
the model's learning difficulty and exhibit interpretability. Our approach
establishes a new state-of-the-art by demonstrating exceptional robustness to
environmental interference, a critical flaw in prior work. Quantitatively, our
model reduces the prediction root mean squared error (RMSE) by 50.3% under
conventional conditions and still achieves an 11.5% lower RMSE than the
previous benchmark's interference-eliminated results. This superior performance
is achieved with a remarkably lightweight framework, utilizing a
MobileNet-based model up to 19 times smaller than competing solutions. The
combination of high accuracy, robustness to interference, and computational
efficiency makes our framework highly suitable for real-time, on-device
deployment in edge devices, paving the way for more intelligent and reliable
wireless communication systems.

TL;DR: 提出一种轻量级、高精度的低压线路系列电弧故障在线检测方法MFNN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电弧故障诊断方法在资源受限条件下难以同时实现快速响应和鲁棒性。本研究旨在提出一种轻量级在线检测方法以解决此问题。

Method: 提出一种基于多频神经网络（MFNN）的方法，该网络嵌入了先验物理知识。通过模拟电弧电流曲线和傅里叶分解分析，设计了一种具有超表达能力的自适应激活函数（EAS）和一种包含分支网络的新型网络架构，以帮助MFNN提取多频特征。

Conclusion: MFNN通过其独特的多频特征提取能力和自适应激活函数，在资源受限条件下实现了高精度、高鲁棒性的电弧故障在线检测，优于现有先进模型。

Abstract: Lightweight online detection of series arc faults is critically needed in
residential and industrial power systems to prevent electrical fires. Existing
diagnostic methods struggle to achieve both rapid response and robust accuracy
under resource-constrained conditions. To overcome the challenge, this work
suggests leveraging a multi-frequency neural network named MFNN, embedding
prior physical knowledge into the network. Inspired by arcing current curve and
the Fourier decomposition analysis, we create an adaptive activation function
with super-expressiveness, termed EAS, and a novel network architecture with
branch networks to help MFNN extract features with multiple frequencies. In our
experiments, eight advanced arc fault diagnosis models across an experimental
dataset with multiple sampling times and multi-level noise are used to
demonstrate the superiority of MFNN. The corresponding experiments show: 1) The
MFNN outperforms other models in arc fault location, befitting from signal
decomposition of branch networks. 2) The noise immunity of MFNN is much better
than that of other models, achieving 14.51% over LCNN and 16.3% over BLS in
test accuracy when SNR=-9. 3) EAS and the network architecture contribute to
the excellent performance of MFNN.

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for reliable multiuser
MIMO operation. In 5G NR, reciprocity-based beamforming via uplink Sounding
Reference Signals (SRS) face resource and coverage constraints, motivating
sparse non-uniform SRS allocation. Prior masked-autoencoder (MAE) approaches
improve coverage but overfit to training masks and degrade under unseen
distortions (e.g., additional masking, interference, clipping, non-Gaussian
noise). We propose a diffusion-based channel inpainting framework that
integrates system-model knowledge at inference via a likelihood-gradient term,
enabling a single trained model to adapt across mismatched conditions. On
standardized CDL channels, the score-based diffusion variant consistently
outperforms a UNet score-model baseline and the one-step MAE under distribution
shift, with improvements up to 14 dB NMSE in challenging settings (e.g.,
Laplace noise, user interference), while retaining competitive accuracy under
matched conditions. These results demonstrate that diffusion-guided inpainting
is a robust and generalizable approach for super-capacity SRS design in 5G NR
systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates a novel computation and communication co-design
framework for large-scale split learning in intelligent reflecting surface
(IRS)-assisted internet of things (IoT) networks integrated with digital twin
(DT) technique. The considered system consists of a multi-antenna access point
(AP), multiple heterogeneous user devices (UDs), and an deployed IRS to enhance
both uplink and downlink transmission. The training process of a deep neural
network is partitioned between devices and the AP, where a DT replica is
activated to replace UDs with insufficient local computation capabilities. We
formulate a delay-optimal split learning problem, which optimizes five key
variables: layer partitioning points, DT assignment decisions, IRS phase shift
matrix, AP downlink power allocation, and DT frequency adjustment, aiming to
minimize the overall end-to-end delay under communication and computation. The
proposed optimization problem is a highly coupled non-convex mixed-integer
problem. Therefore, we solve using an alternating optimization approach
combining closed-form updates, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and
low-complexity heuristics. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
scheme significantly reduces training delay compared to conventional baselines
and achieves up to 35\% delay improvement, especially under high UD density and
stringent power constraints.

### [5] [6D Channel Knowledge Map Construction via Bidirectional Wireless Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26166)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本篇论文提出了一种名为双向无线高斯泼溅（BiWGS）的六维（6D）信道知识图谱（CKM）框架，用于从稀疏信道测量中构建动态的无线信道模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CKM方法通常假设固定的基站配置，无法处理动态变化的发射器（Tx）和接收器（Rx）位置。本研究旨在解决这一局限性，提出一种能够模拟动态Tx/Rx位置下无线信道的方法。

Method: BiWGS使用高斯椭球体来表示无线环境中的虚拟散射体簇和环境障碍物。通过学习双向散射模式和衰减特性，这些椭球体能够捕捉无线电传播特性，从而在变化的收发器配置下准确建模信号传输。

Result: 实验结果表明，BiWGS在构建变化的Tx-Rx位置下的6D信道功率增益图方面，显著优于传统的多层感知（MLP）方法。同时，在3D CKM构建方面，BiWGS实现了与现有最先进的无线辐射场高斯泼溅（WRF-GS）相当的空间频谱预测精度。

Conclusion: BiWGS成功实现了6D CKM构建的维度扩展，并且在保持模型精度的同时，能够处理动态变化的Tx/Rx位置，验证了其在建模动态无线信道方面的有效性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the construction of channel knowledge map (CKM) from
sparse channel measurements. Dif ferent from conventional
two-/three-dimensional (2D/3D) CKM approaches assuming fixed base station
configurations, we present a six-dimensional (6D) CKM framework named
bidirectional wireless Gaussian splatting (BiWGS), which is capable of mod
eling wireless channels across dynamic transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx)
positions in 3D space. BiWGS uses Gaussian el lipsoids to represent virtual
scatterer clusters and environmental obstacles in the wireless environment. By
properly learning the bidirectional scattering patterns and complex attenuation
profiles based on channel measurements, these ellipsoids inherently cap ture
the electromagnetic transmission characteristics of wireless environments,
thereby accurately modeling signal transmission under varying transceiver
configurations. Experiment results show that BiWGS significantly outperforms
classic multi-layer perception (MLP) for the construction of 6D channel power
gain map with varying Tx-Rx positions, and achieves spatial spectrum prediction
accuracy comparable to the state-of-the art wireless radiation field Gaussian
splatting (WRF-GS) for 3D CKM construction. This validates the capability of
the proposed BiWGS in accomplishing dimensional expansion of 6D CKM
construction, without compromising fidelity.

configuration changes of 5G New Radio signals. In 5G networks, a terminal
position is determined from the Time of Arrival of Positioning Reference
Signals transmitted by base stations. We propose an algorithm that improves TOA

positioning in a software defined modem. We also examine how flexible time
frequency resource allocation of PRS affects TOA estimation accuracy and
discuss optimal PRS configurations for a given signal environment.

Abstract: This paper deals with the optimal synthesis of aperture fields for
(radiating) near-field communications in obstructed environments. A physically
consistent model based on knife-edge diffraction is used to formulate the
problem as a maximization in Hilbert space. The optimal solution is obtained as
a matched filter that ``matches" the shape of a diffraction-induced kernel,
thus linking wave propagation with signal processing methods. The framework
supports hardware implementation using continuous apertures such as
metasurfaces or lens antennas. This approach bridges physically grounded
modeling, signal processing, and hardware design for efficient energy focusing
in near-field obstructed channels.

Abstract: Accurate Angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation is essential for next-generation
wireless communication systems to enable reliable beamforming, high-precision
localization, and integrated sensing. Unfortunately, classical high-resolution
techniques require multi-element arrays and extensive snapshot collection,
while generic Machine Learning (ML) approaches often yield black-box models
that lack physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a
Symbolic Regression (SR)-based ML framework. Namely, Symbolic Regression-based
Angle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator (SABER), a constrained
symbolic-regression framework that automatically discovers closed-form beam
pattern and AoA models from path loss measurements with interpretability. SABER
achieves high accuracy while bridging the gap between opaque ML methods and
interpretable physics-driven estimators. First, we validate our approach in a
controlled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of
the known $\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5
degree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further
reduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that
lack physical insight. Then, we implement the same SR-learned inversions in a
real-world, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided indoor testbed.
SABER and unconstrained SR models accurately recover the true AoA with
near-zero error. Finally, we benchmark SABER against the Cram\'er-Rao Lower
Bounds (CRLBs). Our results demonstrate that SABER is an interpretable and
accurate alternative to state-of-the-art and black-box ML-based methods for AoA
estimation.

Abstract: In the classical setting, the training of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
typically relies on a single, sufficiently long observation sequence that can
be regarded as representative of the underlying stochastic process. In this
context, the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is applied in its
specialized form for HMMs, namely the Baum Welch algorithm, which has been
extensively employed in applications such as speech recognition. The objective
of this work is to present pseudocode formulations for both the training and
decoding procedures of HMMs in a different scenario, where the available data
consist of multiple independent temporal sequences generated by the same model,
each of relatively short duration, i.e., containing only a limited number of
samples. Special emphasis is placed on the relevance of this formulation to
longitudinal studies in population health, where datasets are naturally
structured as collections of short trajectories across individuals with point
data at follow up.

Abstract: The proliferation of inverter-based resources challenges traditional
microgrid protection by introducing variable fault currents and complex
transients. This paper presents a statistically adaptive differential
protection scheme based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, implemented via a
Bartlett-corrected G-statistic computed on logarithm-transformed current
magnitudes. The method is a multivariate fault detection engine that employs
the Mahalanobis distance to distinguish healthy and faulty states, enabling
robust detection even in noisy environments. Detection thresholds are
statistically derived from a chi-squared distribution for precise control over
the false alarm rate. Upon detection, a lightweight classifier identifies the
fault type by assessing per-phase G-statistics against dedicated thresholds,
enhanced by a temporal persistence filter for security. Extensive simulations
on a modified CIGRE 14-bus microgrid show high efficacy: sub-cycle average
detection delays, high detection and classification accuracy across operating
modes, resilience to high-impedance faults up to 250 Ohms, tolerance to 10 ms
communication delay, and noise levels down to a 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio.
These findings demonstrate a reproducible and computationally efficient
solution for next-generation AC microgrid protection.

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) often shows significant variability among
people. This fluctuation disrupts reliable acquisition and may result in
distortion or clipping. Modulo sampling is now a promising solution to this
problem, by folding signals instead of saturating them. Recovery of the
original waveform from folded observations is a highly ill-posed problem. In
this work, we propose a method based on a graph neural network, referred to as
GraphUnwrapNet, for the modulo recovery of EEG signals. Our core idea is to
represent an EEG signal as an organized graph whose channels and temporal
connections establish underlying interdependence. One of our key contributions
is in introducing a pre-estimation guided feature injection module to provide
coarse folding indicators that enhance stability during recovery at wrap
boundaries. This design integrates structural information with folding priors
into an integrated framework. We performed comprehensive experiments on the
Simultaneous Task EEG Workload (STEW) dataset. The results demonstrate
consistent enhancements over traditional optimization techniques and
competitive accuracy relative to current deep learning models. Our findings
emphasize the potential of graph-based methodology for robust modulo EEG
recovery.
