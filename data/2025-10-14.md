*Haytham Albousayri,Bechir Hamdaoui,Weng-Keen Wong,Nora Basha*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 基于深度学习的射频指纹识别（RFFP）是实现设备身份识别和认证的关键技术，但其在应对时变、时空、环境、接收器和信道等域变化方面面临严峻挑战。本研究首次探讨了频率跳变对低功耗蓝牙（BLE）设备RFFP的影响，并提出了一种新颖、低成本、域自适应的特征提取方法，该方法在跨环境和跨接收器的分类准确性方面分别取得了高达58%和80%的提升。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的新颖、低成本、域自适应的特征提取方法能够有效解决BLE设备RFFP中的频率跳变问题，并显著提高分类准确性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based radio frequency fingerprinting (RFFP) has become an
enabling physical-layer security technology, allowing device identification and
authentication through received RF signals. This technology, however, faces
significant challenges when it comes to adapting to domain variations, such as
time, location, environment, receiver and channel. For Bluetooth Low Energy
(BLE) devices, addressing these challenges is particularly crucial due to the
BLE protocol's frequency-hopping nature. In this work, and for the first time,
we investigated the frequency hopping effect on RFFP of BLE devices, and
proposed a novel, low-cost, domain-adaptive feature extraction method. Our
approach improves the classification accuracy by up to 58\% across environments
and up to 80\% across receivers compared to existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to flexibly
reconfigure wireless channels by adjusting antenna placement. In this paper, we
study a dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) system enhanced with movable
antennas. To ensure communication security, we aim to maximize the achievable
sum rate by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors, receiving
filter, and antenna placement, subject to radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
performance and transmission covertness constraints. To tackle this challenging
optimization problem, we first employ a Lagrangian dual transformation process
to reformulate it into a more tractable form. Subsequently, the problem is
solved by introducing a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, incorporating
semidefinite relaxation (SDR), projected gradient descent (PGD), and successive
convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed method can significantly improve the covert sum rate, and achieve a
satisfactory balance between the communication and radar performance compared
with existing benchmark schemes by leveraging the flexibility of movable
antennas.

### [3] [Active IRS Assisted Joint Uplink and Downlink Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10045)
*Qiaoyan Peng,Qingqing Wu,Guangji Chen,Wen Chen,Shaodan Ma*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本论文研究了主动智能反射面（AIRS）辅助下的蜂窝通信系统，旨在通过联合优化基站（BS）、AIRS波束成形和AIRS单元分配来最大化上下行（UL/DL）通信的加权和速率（WSR）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在最大化IRS辅助下的通信系统的加权和速率（WSR），并比较不同部署方案（分布式AIRS、BS侧AIRS、用户侧AIRS）的性能。

Method: 研究了三种部署方案，并为分布式AIRS推导了最优和近优解。在多用户场景下，研究了两种波束成形设置（用户自适应和静态），并通过交替优化（AO）算法解决了非凸问题。

Result: 数值结果表明，分布式AIRS优于无源IRS（PIRS）、BS侧AIRS和用户侧AIRS，并且动态IRS波束成形具有优势。

Conclusion: 分布式AIRS在IRS辅助通信系统中具有实际优势，动态IRS波束成形能够带来显著效益。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided
wireless communication system, where active IRSs (AIRSs) are deployed to assist
communication between a base station (BS) and users of both the uplink (UL) and
downlink (DL). We aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of UL and DL
communications through joint optimization of BS, AIRS beamforming, and AIRS
element allocation. First, we study three deployment schemes, namely
distributed AIRSs, BS-side AIRS, and user-side AIRS. For distributed AIRSs,
both optimal and near-optimal solutions are derived in closed form. To draw
useful insights, we analytically compare the deployment schemes in terms of the
rate performance under the single-user setup. For the multi-user case, we
consider two beamforming setups at the distributed AIRSs to balance performance
and complexity tradeoffs. Regarding the user-adaptive AIRS beamforming,
different AIRS beamforming vectors are adopted for each user; while for the
static AIRS beamforming, all users share the same beamforming vectors, with
identical phase shifts but different amplitudes for UL and DL. With the
user-adaptive AIRS beamforming, we focus on the optimization of element
allocation for rate maximization. With static AIRS beamforming, we solve the
rate maximization problem by optimizing the BS transmit/receive beamformers,
user beamforming, and AIRS beamforming. Despite its non-convexity, we develop
an efficient alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm that solves each
sub-problem optimally. Numerical results validate the practical advantages of
distributed AIRSs compared to passive IRS (PIRS), BS-side AIRS, and user-side
AIRS, and highlight the benefits of dynamic IRS beamforming.

### [4] [MIMO Radar Meets Polarization-Reconfigurable Antennas: A BCRB Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10235)
*Jinpeng Xu,Shuowen Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种利用基于移相器可重构极化天线（PRA）的新型多输入多输出（MIMO）雷达系统来感知目标角位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在解决在仅有目标位置参数的先验分布信息可用时，利用新型PRA MIMO雷达系统进行目标角位置感知的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种基于PRA 的 MIMO 雷达系统，并推导了贝叶斯克拉美-罗界（BCRB）来表征其传感性能。然后，为了充分利用 PRA 提供的自由度，研究了传输样本协方差矩阵以及传输和接收移相矢量以最小化 BCRB，并提出了一种交替优化（AO）算法来解决非凸问题。

Conclusion: 所提出的 PRA MIMO 雷达系统和交替优化算法能够有效地进行目标角位置感知，并在性能上优于传统方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a novel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
radar system aided by phase shifter based polarization-reconfigurable antennas
(PRAs). Specifically, a base station (BS) equipped with multiple PRAs at both
the transmitter and the receiver aims to sense the unknown and random angular
location parameter of a point target via sending wireless signals and
processing the received echo signals reflected by the target, where only prior
distribution information about the location parameter is available for
exploitation. Firstly, we characterize the sensing performance of this novel
PRA-based MIMO radar system by deriving the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB)
of the mean-squared error (MSE) in estimating the desired location parameter
with prior distribution information. Then, to fully exploit the new design
degrees-of-freedom (DoF) empowered by PRAs, we study the joint optimization of
the transmit sample covariance matrix as well as the transmit and receive phase
shift vectors to minimize the sensing BCRB subject to a transmit power
constraint. This problem is non-convex and difficult to solve due to the
coupling among optimization variables. To resolve this issue, we develop an
alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm which iteratively obtains the
closed-form optimal solution to each variable with the others being fixed at
each time, thus being guaranteed to converge to at least a stationary point of
the joint optimization problem. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of
the proposed algorithm.

Result: 所提出的WLCT能够生成三维时-频-चिरप率表示，并可能在三维信号分离方面具有巨大潜力。

Conclusion: 窗函数线性变换（WLCT）为分析和分离重叠的非平稳信号提供了一种有前景的新方法。

Abstract: In nature, signals often appear in the form of the superposition of multiple
non-stationary signals. The overlap of signal components in the time-frequency
domain poses a significant challenge for signal analysis. One approach to
addressing this problem is to introduce an additional chirprate parameter and
use the chirplet transform (CT) to elevate the two-dimensional time-frequency
representation to a three-dimensional time-frequency-chirprate representation.
From a certain point of view, the CT of a signal can be regarded as a windowed
special linear canonical transform of that signal, undergoing a shift and a
modulation.
  In this paper, we develop this idea to propose a novel windowed linear
canonical transform (WLCT), which provides a new time-frequency-chirprate
representation. We discuss four types of WLCTs. In addition, we use a special
X-ray transform to further sharpen the time-frequency-chirprate representation.
Furthermore, we derive the corresponding three-dimensional synchrosqueezed
transform, demonstrating that the WLCTs have great potential for
three-dimensional signal separation.

### [6] [Multi-Carrier Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers with Enhanced Bandwidth Feature for Communication and Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10473)
*Huizhi Wang,Tierui Gong,Emil Björnson,Chau Yuen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种多载波里德堡原子量子接收器（MC-RAQR），扩展了传统接收器的带宽和性能，适用于多载波通信和传感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统里德堡原子量子接收器（RAQR）在接收宽带射频信号方面存在带宽限制，阻碍了其在多载波通信和传感中的应用。

Method: 提出了一种五能级MC-RAQR结构，推导了其幅度和相位，并提取了基带电信号。分析了其在多载波通信和传感中的信道容量以及到达角（AoA）和距离参数的估计精度。

Result: MC-RAQR实现了14兆赫兹的带宽，比传统RAQR的带宽提高了56倍。信道容量比传统天线和RAQR分别提高了22倍和3倍。AoA估计的均方误差（MSE）是传统RAQR的0.16%，距离估计的MSE是传统天线克拉美罗界（CRB）的0.01%。

Conclusion: MC-RAQR具有显著的带宽扩展能力和优越的性能，能够兼容正交频分复用（OFDM）等波形，在多载波信号接收方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have attracted significant attention
in recent years due to their ultra-high sensitivity. Although capable of
precisely detecting the amplitude and phase of weak signals, conventional RAQRs
face inherent limitations in accurately receiving wideband RF signals, due to
the discrete nature of atomic energy levels and their intrinsic instantaneous
bandwidth constraints. These limitations hinder their direct application to
multi-carrier communication and sensing. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a multi-carrier Rydberg atomic quantum receiver (MC-RAQR) structure
with five energy levels. We derive the amplitude and phase of the MC-RAQR and
extract the baseband electrical signal for signal processing. In terms of
multi-carrier communication and sensing, we analyze the channel capacity and
accuracy of angle of arrival (AoA) and distance parameters, respectively.
Numerical results validate our proposed model, showing that the MC-RAQR can
achieve up to a bandwidth of 14 MHz, which is 56-fold larger than the
conventional RAQRs. As a result, the channel capacity and the resolution for
multi-target sensing are improved significantly. Specifically, the channel
capacity of MC-RAQR is 22-fold and 3-fold larger than the conventional antennas
and RAQRs, respectively. For sensing performance, the MSE of AoA estimation for
MC-RAQR is 0.16% of the conventional RAQR and the MSE of distance estimation is
0.01% of the CRB of conventional antennas, showing the superior performance of
the MC-RAQR. This demonstrates its compatibility with waveforms such as
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and its significant
advantages for multi-carrier signal reception.

Abstract: The graph linear canonical transform (GLCT)-based filtering methods often
optimize transform parameters and filters separately, which results in high
computational costs and limited stability. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a trainable joint optimization framework that combines GLCT parameters
and Wiener filtering into an end-to-end learning process, allowing for
synergistic optimization between transform domain construction and filtering
operations. The proposed method not only eliminates the cumbersome grid search
required by traditional strategies but also significantly enhances the
flexibility and training stability of the filtering system. Experimental
results on real-world graph data show the proposed method outperforms existing
methods in denoising tasks, featuring superior denoising performance, higher
robustness and lower computational complexity.

### [8] [SVD-based ugmt-gft on directed product graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10532)

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的UGRM-GFT方法在去噪任务（特别是信噪比和带宽效率方面）显著优于传统的固定矩阵方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的UGRM-GFT方法能够有效处理复杂图拓扑中的信号，并在去噪任务中展现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Traditional directed graph signal processing generally depends on fixed
representation matrices, whose rigid structures limit the model's ability to
adapt to complex graph topologies. To address this issue, this study employed
the unified graph representation matrix (UGRM) to propose a generalized graph
Fourier transform (UGRM-GFT) method based on singular value decomposition (SVD)
for signal analysis on directed graphs and Cartesian product graphs. We defined
UGRM-GFT for general directed graphs by introducing a parameterized UGRM that
incorporates traditional representations such as the Laplacian matrix and
adjacency matrix. The SVD is used to construct spectral transform pairs with
both left and right singular vectors. We extended this approach to two types of
UGRM-GFTs applied to directed Cartesian product graphs. UGRM-GFT-I performs SVD
directly on the composite UGRM matrix of the two-dimensional graph structure,
suitable for globally coupled graph signals. UGRM-GFT-II separately applies SVD
to the UGRMs of the two-factor graphs and then combines the results,
significantly reducing computational complexity while preserving spectral
expressiveness. Theoretical analysis confirmed the monotonicity of the proposed
method with respect to the parameters alpha and k embedded in the UGRM.
Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed
method significantly outperforms traditional fixed-matrix approaches in
denoising tasks, with a particular emphasis on signal-to-noise ratio and
bandwidth efficiency.

Abstract: This study proposes a multi-radar system for non-contact physiological
sensing across arbitrary body orientations. In integrating signals obtained

demonstrate that, compared with a single-radar setup, the proposed system
reduced the root mean square error of the respiratory interval by 35.5%,
decreased the mean absolute error of the respiratory rate by 30.8%, and
improved accuracy by 9.4 percentage points. These results highlight that
combining multiple radar viewpoints with signal integration enables stable
respiratory measurement regardless of body orientation.

### [10] [Large Language Model-Empowered Channel Prediction and Predictive Beamforming for LEO Satellite Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10561)
*Zhixiong Chen,Hyundong Shin,Arumugam Nallanathan,Jonathon Chambers*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的信道预测框架CPLLM和beamforming框架BFLLM，用于低地球轨道（LEO）卫星通信，以提高系统容量和实现高速连接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的信道预测和预测性beamforming方法在模型泛化能力和适应时变无线传播环境方面存在局限性。

Method: CPLLM框架包括一个CSI编码器，将原始CSI数据映射到文本嵌入空间，以及一个CSI解码器，用于同时预测多个未来时间槽的CSI。BFLLM框架在CPLLM架构基础上，增加了一个专门的beamforming解码器。两种框架均采用LoRA参数高效微调策略，冻结预训练LLM，并注入可训练的低秩矩阵。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的CPLLM和BFLLM框架能够有效预测信道状态信息（CSI）并生成beamforming策略，克服了现有方法的局限性，有望提升LEO卫星通信系统的性能。

Abstract: Accurate channel prediction and effective beamforming are essential for low
Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications to enhance system capacity and
enable high-speed connectivity. Most existing channel prediction and predictive
beamforming methods are limited by model generalization capabilities and
struggle to adapt to time-varying wireless propagation environments. Inspired
by the remarkable generalization and reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), this work proposes an LLM-based channel prediction framework,
namely CPLLM, to forecast future channel state information (CSI) for LEO
satellites based on historical CSI data. In the proposed CPLLM, a dedicated CSI
encoder is designed to map raw CSI data into the textual embedding space,
effectively bridging the modality gap and enabling the LLM to perform reliable
reasoning over CSI data. Additionally, a CSI decoder is introduced to
simultaneously predict CSI for multiple future time slots, substantially
reducing the computational burden and inference latency associated with the
inherent autoregressive decoding process of LLMs. Then, instead of training the
LLM from scratch, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, i.e.,
LoRA, for CPLLM, where the pretrained LLM remains frozen and trainable low-rank
matrices are injected into each Transformer decoder layer to enable effective
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we extend CPLLM to directly generate beamforming
strategies for future time slots based on historical CSI data, namely BFLLM.
This extended framework retains the same architecture as CPLLM, while
introducing a dedicated beamforming decoder to output beamforming strategies.
Finally, extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed approaches in channel prediction and predictive beamforming for LEO
satellite communications.

Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system
covert waveform design method for complex clutter environments, with the core
objective of maximizing the signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR). The
design achieves efficient clutter suppression while meeting the covertness
requirement through joint optimization of the transmit waveform and receive
filter, enabling cooperative radar detection and wireless communication. This
study presents key innovations that explicitly address target Doppler shift
uncertainty, significantly enhancing system robustness against Doppler effects.
To ensure communication reliability, the method incorporates phase difference
constraints between communication signal elements in the waveform design, along
with energy constraint, covert constraint, and peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR) constraint. The original non-convex optimization problem is transformed
into a tractable convex optimization form through convex optimization
technique. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimized waveform not only
satisfies the covertness requirement in complex clutter environment, but also
achieves superior target detection performance. It also ensures reliable
communication and confirms the effectiveness of propose method.

*Emanuele Peschiera,Sangbu Yun,Youngjoo Lee,Liesbet Van der Perre,François Rottenberg*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: FR3基站（BS）的功耗与数据速率的关系研究表明，对于具有1024个天线的BS，当射频链数量较少时，功放是主要功耗来源；当射频链数量增加时，数字和模拟信号处理的功耗占主导地位。混合波束成形在提高数据速率和能源效率方面优于全数字波束成形。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究面向6G网络，关注上中频段（FR3，7-24 GHz）的基站（BS）架构，并探究其功耗与数据速率的关系。

Method: 对FR3 BS的数字和模拟信号处理、功率放大器（PA）、供电和冷却在四个不同阶段（数据、信令、微睡眠和空闲）进行了功耗建模，并比较了混合部分连接波束成形和全数字波束成形。

Result: 对于1024天线的BS，在30%负载下，当射频链数量小于等于64时，PA功耗最大；当射频链数量达到512或更多时，数字和模拟信号处理功耗占据主导。全数字波束成形中，数字和模拟信号处理的功耗是PA的2到4倍。混合波束成形实现了1.3 Gbit/s/用户的下行速率，并将能源效率提高了1.4倍。

Conclusion: 混合波束成形相比全数字波束成形能显著提高FR3基站的能源效率和数据速率。

Abstract: Increasing attention is given to the upper mid-band or Frequency Range 3
(FR3), from 7 to 24 GHz, in the research towards sixth-generation (6G)
networks. Promises of offering large data rates at favorable propagation
conditions are leading to novel FR3 base station (BS) architectures, with up to
thousands of antenna elements and radio-frequency (RF) chains. This work
investigates the power consumption of prospective FR3 BSs and its relation to
the delivered data rates. We model the power consumed by digital and analog
signal processing, power amplifiers (PAs), and supply and cooling during four
phases (data, signaling, micro-sleep, and idle) in downlink and uplink. Hybrid
partially-connected beamforming is compared to fully-digital one. Results show
that, for BS arrays with $1024$ antennas at $30\%$ of load, the PA consumes
most of the power when $64$ or less RF chains are utilized, while the digital
and analog processing consumption takes over when the number of RF chains is
$512$ or more. The digital plus analog processing consumes $2\times$ to
$4\times$ more than the PA for fully-digital beamforming. Hybrid beamforming
achieves $1.3$ Gbit/s/user in downlink while improving the energy efficiency by
$1.4\times$ compared to fully-digital beamforming.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: HYPERDOA利用超维计算（HDC）提出了一种新的DOA估计算法，在低信噪比和相干信源场景下提高了35.39%的准确性，同时能耗降低了93%，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DOA估计算法在低信噪比条件下精度不足，而深度学习方法能耗高且不透明，不适用于资源受限和安全关键的系统。因此，需要一种既精确又高效的DOA估计算法。

Method: HYPERDOA框架采用两种不同的特征提取策略（平均空间-滞后自相关和空间平滑）用于其HDC流程，并将DOA估计重新构建为模式识别问题。该方法利用HDC对噪声的鲁棒性和透明的代数运算来替代昂贵的矩阵分解和深度学习方法的“黑箱”特性。

Conclusion: HYPERDOA在准确性和效率方面具有双重优势，是一种适用于边缘设备上任务关键型应用的强大且可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation techniques face a critical trade-off,
as classical methods often lack accuracy in challenging, low signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) conditions, while modern deep learning approaches are too
energy-intensive and opaque for resource-constrained, safety-critical systems.
We introduce HYPERDOA, a novel estimator leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing
(HDC). The framework introduces two distinct feature extraction strategies --
Mean Spatial-Lag Autocorrelation and Spatial Smoothing -- for its HDC pipeline,
and then reframes DoA estimation as a pattern recognition problem. This
approach leverages HDC's inherent robustness to noise and its transparent
algebraic operations to bypass the expensive matrix decompositions and
``black-box'' nature of classical and deep learning methods, respectively. Our
evaluation demonstrates that HYPERDOA achieves ~35.39% higher accuracy than
state-of-the-art methods in low-SNR, coherent-source scenarios. Crucially, it
also consumes ~93% less energy than competing neural baselines on an embedded
NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX platform. This dual advantage in accuracy and
efficiency establishes HYPERDOA as a robust and viable solution for
mission-critical applications on edge devices.

Abstract: Direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation with leaky-wave antennas (LWAs) offers
a compact and cost-effective alternative to conventional antenna arrays but
remains challenging in the presence of coherent sources. To address this issue,
we propose a spatially filtered sparse Bayesian learning (SF-SBL) framework.
Firstly, the field of view (FoV) is divided into angular sectors according to
the frequency beam-scanning property of LWAs, and Bayesian inverse problems are
then solved within each sector to improve efficiency and reduce computational
cost. Both on-grid SBL and off-grid SBL formulations are developed. Simulation
results show that the proposed approach achieves robust and accurate DoA
estimation, even with coherent sources.

Abstract: Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation in sensor arrays faces limitations
under demanding conditions, including low signal-to-noise ratio,
single-snapshot scenarios, coherent sources, and unknown source counts.
Conventional beamforming suffers from sidelobe interference, adaptive methods
(e.g., MVDR) and subspace algorithms (e.g., MUSIC) degrade with limited
snapshots or coherent signals, while sparse-recovery approaches (e.g., L1-SVD)
incur high computational complexity for large arrays. In this article, we
construct the concept of the optimal spatial filter to solve the DOA estimation
problem under demanding conditions by utilizing the sparsity of spatial
signals. By utilizing the concept of the optimal spatial filter, we have
transformed the DOA estimation problem into a solution problem for the optimal
spatial filter. We propose the Spatial Signal Focusing and Noise Suppression
(SSFNS) algorithm, which is a novel DOA estimation framework grounded in the
theoretical existence of an optimal spatial filter, to solve for the optimal
spatial filter and obtain DOA. Through experiments, it was found that the
proposed algorithm is suitable for large aperture two-dimensional arrays and
experiments have shown that our proposed algorithm performs better than other
algorithms in scenarios with few snapshots or even a single snapshot, low
signal-to-noise ratio, coherent signals, and unknown signal numbers in
two-dimensional large aperture arrays.

Abstract: Pinching antennas (PAs), as an emerging flexible-antenna technology, enables
movable PAs deployed along waveguides to customize channel conditions over a
large scale. This paper investigates an application of PAs to enable
physical-layer security (PLS) by enlarging the channel condition diversity
between legitimate users (LUs) and eavesdroppers (Eves). Particularly, we focus
on the dual-waveguide scenario, where the two waveguides employs multiple PAs
to serve multiple LUs in the presence of an Eve. Specifically, we consider two
waveguide placement strategies, i.e., parallel placement and orthogonal
placement. Meanwhile, we incorporate two channel models, i.e., in-waveguide
phase shifts, and in-waveguide phase shifts and attenuation. We formulate the
secure sum rate (SSR) and secure energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problems,
and propose a two-stage algorithm to solve them. The first stage adopts a
particle swarm optimization (PSO) method with an improved feasibility module,
termed FeaPSO, for PA placement, and the second stage employs the successive
convex approximate (SCA) method to optimize beamforming and artificial noise
vectors. Furthermore, we conduct numerical comparisons between the two
placement strategies in terms of average performance and a special case where
an Eve is positioned in front of LUs. Numerical results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that PAs can
significantly improve both SSR and SEE. Additionally, the necessity of
orthogonal waveguide placement is explicitly verified.

Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) communication is nearing its physical and thermodynamic
limits, where further performance gains through spectrum optimization alone
have become increasingly unsustainable. Finite bandwidth, propagation loss at
higher frequencies, and the inherent trade-offs between energy and information
constrain the scalability of 6G and beyond systems. These limitations drive the
search for alternative mechanisms for information transfer beyond conventional
EM propagation. This work introduces a state-centric framework for post-6G
communication, in which information is conveyed by manipulating physical,
biological, and cognitive states rather than EM waves. It identifies ten
foundational paradigms that define potential carriers and interaction
mechanisms for the post-electromagnetic era and outlines a research roadmap
toward self-organizing, cognitively integrated networks. Together, these
developments envision a new class of communication systems that are
energy-aware, adaptive, and capable of uniting matter, life, and intelligence
within a single informational continuum. By establishing the conceptual basis
for this transition, the work provides a foundation for future research aimed
at realizing communication paradigms that transcend the limitations of
spectrum-bound systems.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology offers significant
promise in enhancing wireless communication systems, but its dual-use potential
also introduces substantial security risks. This survey explores the security
implications of RIS in next-generation wireless networks. We first highlight
the dual-use nature of RIS, demonstrating how its communication-enhancing
capabilities can be exploited by adversaries to compromise legitimate users. We
identify a new class of security vulnerabilities termed ``passive-active hybrid
attacks,'' where RIS, despite passively handling signals, can be reconfigured
to actively engage in malicious activities, enabling various RIS-assisted
attacks, such as eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle (MITM), replay, reflection
jamming, and side-channel attacks. Furthermore, we reveal how adversaries can
exploit the openness of wireless channels to introduce adversarial
perturbations in artificial intelligence-driven RIS networks, disrupting
communication terminals and causing misclassifications or errors in RIS
reflection predictions. Despite these risks, RIS technology also plays a
critical role in enhancing security and privacy across radio frequency (RF) and
visible light communication (VLC) systems. By synthesizing current insights and
highlighting emerging threats, we provide actionable insights into cross-layer
collaboration, advanced adversarial defenses, and the balance between security
and cost. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of RIS technology's
security landscape and underscores the urgent need for robust security
frameworks in the development of future wireless systems.

Abstract: Acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical for reliable
and efficient wireless communication, but challenges such as high pilot
overhead and channel aging hinder timely and accurate CSI acquisition. CSI
prediction, which forecasts future CSI from historical observations, offers a
promising solution. Recent deep learning approaches, including recurrent neural
networks and Transformers, have achieved notable success but typically learn
deterministic mappings, limiting their ability to capture the stochastic and
multimodal nature of wireless channels. In this paper, we introduce a novel
probabilistic framework for CSI prediction based on diffusion models, offering
a flexible design that supports integration of diverse prediction schemes. We
decompose the CSI prediction task into two components: a temporal encoder,
which extracts channel dynamics, and a diffusion-based generator, which
produces future CSI samples. We investigate two inference
schemes-autoregressive and sequence-to-sequence- and explore multiple diffusion
backbones, including U-Net and Transformer-based architectures. Furthermore, we
examine a diffusion-based approach without an explicit temporal encoder and
utilize the DDIM scheduling to reduce model complexity. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that our diffusion-based models significantly outperform
state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified and system-agnostic analysis of the ambiguity
function (AF) characteristics of four representative multicarrier waveforms,
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency
space (OTFS), affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), and chirp-permuted
AFDM (CP-AFDM), which are considered as key candidates for enabling integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC) in future sixth generation (6G) networks. The
AF of each waveform is obtained directly from its discrete-time definition and
enhanced via ideal fractional interpolation, enabling precise characterization
of its continuous-time delay-Doppler response. Two signaling modes are
examined: a communication-oriented case with random information symbols
suitable only for monostatic scenarios, and a sensing-oriented case with fixed
unimodular symbols suitable for general multi-static scenarios. Furthermore,
the AFs and the ambiguity metrics including the 3dB mainlobe width,
peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR), and integrated sidelobe ratio (ISLR), are
evaluated in normalized delay-Doppler units, enabling direct translation to any
physical system configuration defined by bandwidth, sampling frequency, or
symbol duration, while ensuring straightforward and consistent comparison
across waveforms. The results establish a consistent benchmark for comparing
waveform sensing capabilities in ISAC design, consolidating known behaviors:
OFDM exhibits excellent delay resolution and sidelobe behavior but poor Doppler
response, whereas advanced waveforms achieve improved balance between delay and
Doppler resolution with varying sidelobe characteristics. The simulation code
of the smooth AFs, is openly shared to promote reproducibility and support
future ISAC waveform research.

Abstract: Graph signal processing (GSP) advances spectral analysis on irregular
domains. However, existing two-dimensional graph fractional Fourier transform
(2D-GFRFT) employs a single fractional order for both factor graphs, thereby
limiting its adaptability to heterogeneous signals. We proposed the
two-dimensional graph bi-fractional Fourier transform (2D-GBFRFT), which
assigns independent fractional orders to the factor graphs of a Cartesian
product while preserving separability. We established invertibility, unitarity,
and index additivity, and developed two filtering schemes: a Wiener-style
design through grid search and a differentiable framework that jointly
optimizes transform orders and diagonal spectral filters. We further introduced
a hybrid interpolation with the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform
(JFRFT), controlled by a tunable parameter that balances the two methods. In
the domains of synthetic Cartesian product graph signals, authentic temporal
graph datasets, and dynamic image deblurring, 2D-GBFRFT consistently surpasses
2D-GFRFT and enhances JFRFT. Experimental results confirmed the versatility and
superior performance of 2D-GBFRFT for filtering in GSP.

Abstract: Superimposed pilot (SIP) schemes face significant challenges in effectively
superimposing and separating pilot and data signals, especially in multiuser
mobility scenarios with rapidly varying channels. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel channel-aware learning framework for SIP schemes, termed
CaSIP, that jointly optimizes pilot-data power (PDP) allocation and a receiver
network for pilot-data interference (PDI) elimination, by leveraging channel
path gain information, a form of large-scale channel state information (CSI).
The proposed framework identifies user-specific, resource element-wise PDP
factors and develops a deep neural network-based SIP receiver comprising
explicit channel estimation and data detection components. To properly leverage
path gain data, we devise an embedding generator that projects it into
embeddings, which are then fused with intermediate feature maps of the channel
estimation network. Simulation results demonstrate that CaSIP efficiently
outperforms traditional pilot schemes and state-of-the-art SIP schemes in terms
of sum throughput and channel estimation accuracy, particularly under
high-mobility and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.

Abstract: We consider a problem faced by an intelligent roadside unit (RSU) monitoring
a roadway by a video camera. Suppose the RSU notices that a particular car in
its visual field needs to execute a specific evasive maneuver to avoid danger.
It would like to send a packet addressed to that particular car with this
suggestion. The problem is that while all the cars are communicating with the
RSU, the RSU does not know which car in the video is associated with what IP
address. So, it does not know which IP address to send the packet to. Indeed,
the problem of matching addresses with cars in the visual field is a
fundamental open problem. We provide an active solution employing dynamic
watermarking that was originally developed for the security of cyber-physical
systems. This technique calls for a car to superpose a small random excitation
onto its actuation commands for steering angle or throttle/brake positions. The
car sends this random waveform to the RSU in a packet containing its IP
address. By signal processing of the video stream of a car at the RSU it can
verify whether it matches with the waveform in the packet and thereby
associates that the IP address of the packet with that car in the visual field.
The RSU thereby determines which IP address is associated with which car in its
visual field. We present two demonstrations of performance. We demonstrate
experimental results on a laboratory transportation automated vehicles, a
vision system, and a network, as well as on the field with two passenger sedans
in practice. The results demonstrate that employing the dynamic watermarking
method enables an RSU to distinguish the communication of a target vehicle from
that of other IP addresses of nearby vehicles.

Abstract: WiFi sensing based on channel state information (CSI) collected from
commodity WiFi devices has shown great potential across a wide range of
applications, including vital sign monitoring and indoor localization. Existing
WiFi sensing approaches typically estimate motion information directly from
CSI. However, they often overlook the inherent advantages of channel impulse
response (CIR), a delay-domain representation that enables more intuitive and
principled motion sensing by naturally concentrating motion energy and
separating multipath components. Motivated by this, we revisit WiFi sensing and
introduce CIRSense, a new framework that enhances the performance and
interpretability of WiFi sensing with CIR. CIRSense is built upon a new motion
model that characterizes fractional delay effects, a fundamental challenge in
CIR-based sensing. This theoretical model underpins technical advances for the
three challenges in WiFi sensing: hardware distortion compensation,
high-resolution distance estimation, and subcarrier aggregation for extended
range sensing. CIRSense, operating with a 160 MHz channel bandwidth,
demonstrates versatile sensing capabilities through its dual-mode design,
achieving a mean error of approximately 0.25 bpm in respiration monitoring and
0.09 m in distance estimation. Comprehensive evaluations across residential
spaces, far-range scenarios, and multi-target settings demonstrate CIRSense's
superior performance over state-of-the-art CSI-based baselines. Notably, at a
challenging sensing distance of 20 m, CIRSense achieves at least 3x higher
average accuracy with more than 4.5x higher computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: A common assumption in signal processing is that underlying data numerically
conforms to a Gaussian distribution. It is commonly utilized in signal
processing to describe unknown additive noise in a system and is often
justified by citing the central limit theorem for sums of random variables,
although the central limit theorem applies only to sums of independent
identically distributed random variables. However, many linear operations in
signal processing take the form of weighted sums, which transforms the random
variables such that their distributions are no longer identical. One such
operation is a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. FIR filters are commonly
used in signal processing applications as a pre-processing step. FIR output
noise is generally assumed to be Gaussian. This article examines the FIR output
response in the presence of uniformly distributed quantization noise. We
express the FIR output uncertainty in terms of the input quantization
uncertainty and filter coefficients. We show that the output uncertainty cannot
be assumed to be Gaussian, but depending on the application a Gaussian
estimation may still be useful. Then, we show through detailed numerical
simulations that the output uncertainty distribution of the filter can be
estimated through its most dominant coefficients.

Abstract: Real-time and contactless monitoring of vital signs, such as respiration and
heartbeat, alongside reliable communication, is essential for modern healthcare
systems, especially in remote and privacy-sensitive environments. Traditional
wireless communication and sensing networks fall short in meeting all the
stringent demands of eHealth, including accurate sensing, high data efficiency,
and privacy preservation. To overcome the challenges, we propose a novel
integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) framework. In
the proposed system, a service robot utilises radar to detect patient positions
and monitor their vital signs, while sending updates to the medical devices.
Instead of transmitting raw physiological information, the robot computes and
communicates semantically extracted health features to medical devices. This
semantic processing improves data throughput and preserves the clinical
relevance of the messages, while enhancing data privacy by avoiding the
transmission of sensitive data. Leveraging the estimated patient locations, the
robot employs an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter to actively track
patient motion, thereby enabling robust beam steering for continuous and
reliable monitoring. We then propose a joint optimisation of the beamforming
matrices and the semantic extraction ratio, subject to computing capability and
power budget constraints, with the objective of maximising both the semantic
secrecy rate and sensing accuracy. Simulation results validate that the ISCSC
framework achieves superior sensing accuracy, improved semantic transmission
efficiency, and enhanced privacy preservation compared to conventional joint
sensing and communication methods.

Abstract: We introduce mathematical tools and fixed point algorithms for optimal
statistical max-min power control in cellular and cell-less massive MIMO
systems. Unlike previous studies that rely on the use-and-then-forget (UatF)
lower bound on Shannon achievable (ergodic) rates, our proposed framework can
deal with alternative bounds that explicitly consider perfect or imperfect
channel state information (CSI) at the decoder. In doing so, we address
limitations of UatF-based algorithms, which inherit the shortcomings of the
UatF bound. For example, the UatF bound can be overly conservative: in extreme
cases, under fully statistical (nonadaptive) beamforming in zero-mean channels,
the UatF bound produces trivial (zero) rate bounds. It also lacks scale
invariance: merely scaling the beamformers can change the bound drastically,
especially when simple beamforming strategies are employed. In contrast, our
framework is compatible with information-theoretic bounds that do not suffer
from the above drawbacks. We illustrate the framework by solving a max-min
power control problem considering a standard bound that exploits instantaneous
CSI at the decoder.

Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is essential for both high-rate communication and
high-precision sensing in 6G wireless systems. However, a major performance
limitation arises from calibration mismatches when operating phased-array
antennas under real-world conditions. To address this issue, we propose to
integrate antenna element self-calibration into a variational sparse Bayesian
learning (VSBL) algorithm for parametric channel estimation. We model antenna
gain and phase deviations as latent variables and derive explicit update
equations to jointly infer these calibration parameters and the channel
parameters: the model order, complex amplitudes, delays, angles, and the noise
variance. The resulting algorithm operates online and adapts in real time to
hardware-induced mismatches. We assess its performance in terms of the root
mean square error (RMSE) and the optimal subpattern-assignment (OSPA) metric,
demonstrating consistent improvements over conventional VSBL without
calibration. Our results demonstrate that embedding self-calibration within
Bayesian inference significantly enhances the robustness of channel estimation.

Abstract: The ever-growing demand for ultra-high data rates, massive connectivity, and
joint communication-sensing capabilities in future wireless networks is driving
research into sub-terahertz (sub-THz) communications. While these frequency
bands offer abundant spectrum, they also pose severe propagation and hardware
design challenges, motivating the search for alternative antenna solutions
beyond conventional antenna arrays. Leaky-wave antennas (LWAs) have emerged as
a promising candidate for sub-THz systems due to their simple feed structure,
low fabrication cost, and inherent angle-frequency coupling, which enables
frequency-controlled beamsteering with simple hardware. In this article, we
review the fundamentals of the LWA technology, highlight their unique
properties, and showcase their potential in multi-user wideband sub-THz
wireless communications. We present representative studies demonstrating that
LWAs can simultaneously support high-rate multi-user communications and
accurate localization using only a single antenna element. Finally, several key
open challenges are outlined, spanning algorithm design, signal processing,
