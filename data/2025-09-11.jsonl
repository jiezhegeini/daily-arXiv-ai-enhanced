There is a research gap in\ncomparing data modalities, specifically signals and videos, for motion\nintention recognition. To address this, the study leverages deep learning to\nassess two different modalities in recognizing workers' motion intention at the\nearly stage of movement in drywall installation tasks. The Convolutional Neural\nNetwork - Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model utilizing surface\nelectromyography (sEMG) data achieved an accuracy of around 87% with an average\ntime of 0.04 seconds to perform prediction on a sample input. Meanwhile, the\npre-trained Video Swin Transformer combined with transfer learning harnessed\nvideo sequences as input to recognize motion intention and attained an accuracy\nof 94% but with a longer average time of 0.15 seconds for a similar prediction.\nThis study emphasizes the unique strengths and trade-offs of both data formats,\ndirecting their systematic deployments to enhance HRC in real-world\nconstruction projects."}

However, reliance on unimodal\nrepresentations can degrade reconstruction under poor channel conditions, and\nprivacy concerns of the semantic information attack also gain increasing\nattention. In this work, a privacy-preserving semantic communication framework\nis proposed to protect sensitive content of the image data. Leveraging a\nvision-language model (VLM), the proposed framework identifies and removes\nprivate content regions from input images prior to transmission. A shared\nprivacy database enables semantic alignment between the transmitter and\nreceiver to ensure consistent identification of sensitive entities. At the\nreceiver, a generative module reconstructs the masked regions using learned\nsemantic priors and conditioned on the received text embedding. Simulation\nresults show that generalizes well to unseen image processing tasks, improves\nreconstruction quality at the authorized receiver by over 10% using text\nembedding, and reduces identity leakage to the eavesdropper by more than 50%."}

The core property of RTR is that its\nfrequency responses satisfy a linear complementary relation HLF(f)+HHF(f)=1. so\nthat the original signal can be perfectly reconstructed by linear summation of\nthe two channels. Theoretical derivation and circuit simulations demonstrate\nthat RTR provides superior energy efficiency, phase consistency, and robustness\nagainst component tolerances.

By contrast, the stacked\nintelligent metasurfaces (SIM) can perform wave-based precoding at near-light\nspeed, drastically reducing baseband overhead. However, realizing SIM-enhanced\nfully-analog beamforming for wideband multiuser transmissions remains\nchallenging, as the SIM configuration has to handle interference across all\nsubcarriers. To address this, this paper proposes a flexible subcarrier\nallocation strategy to fully reap the SIM-assisted fully-analog beamforming\ncapability in an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) system,\nwhere each subcarrier selectively serves one or more users to balance\ninterference mitigation and resource utilization of SIM. We propose an\niterative algorithm to jointly optimize the subcarrier assignment matrix and\nSIM transmission coefficients, approximating an interference-free channel for\nthose selected subcarriers. Results show that the proposed system has low\nfitting errors yet allows each user to exploit more subcarriers. Further\ncomparisons highlight a fundamental trade-off: our system achieves near-zero\ninterference and robust data reliability without incurring the hardware burdens\nof digital precoding."}

To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a framework\nthat effectively incorporates the fluid antenna (FA) and the artificial noise\n(AN) techniques. Specifically, the minimum secrecy rate (MSR) among multiple\neavesdroppers is maximized by jointly optimizing AAV deployment, signal and AN\nprecoders, and FA positions. In particular, the worst-case MSR is considered by\ntaking the channel uncertainties due to the uncertainty about eavesdropping\nlocations into account. To tackle the highly coupled optimization variables and\nthe channel uncertainties in the formulated problem, an efficient and robust\nalgorithm is proposed. Particularly, the uncertain regions of eavesdroppers,\nwhose shapes can be arbitrary, are disposed by constructing convex hull. In\naddition, two movement modes of FAs are considered, namely, free movement mode\nand zonal movement mode, for which different optimization techniques are\napplied, respectively. Numerical results show that, the proposed FA schemes\nboost security by exploiting additional spatial DoF rather than transmit power,\nwhile AN provides remarkable gains under high transmit power. Furthermore, the\nsynergy between FA and AN results in a secure advantage that exceeds the sum of\ntheir individual contributions, achieving a balance between security and\nreliability under limited resources."}

With a numerology of 480 kHz, results show\nthat PN introduces range RMSE floors of 0.04 to 0.05 m and velocity RMSE floors\nof 0.12 to 0.18 m/s.
