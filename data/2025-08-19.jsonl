While\nexisting self-feedback methods aim to address this problem, they are\nconstrained by the capabilities of a single model, which can lead to\noverconfidence in incorrect answers, reward hacking, and even training\ncollapse. To this end, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Coevolutionary\nCollective Feedback (RLCCF), a novel RL framework that enables multi-model\ncollaborative evolution without external supervision. Specifically, RLCCF\noptimizes the ability of a model collective by maximizing its Collective\nConsistency (CC), which jointly trains a diverse ensemble of LLMs and provides\nreward signals by voting on collective outputs. Moreover, each model's vote is\nweighted by its Self-Consistency (SC) score, ensuring that more confident\nmodels contribute more to the collective decision. Benefiting from the diverse\noutput distributions and complementary abilities of multiple LLMs, RLCCF\nenables the model collective to continuously enhance its reasoning ability\nthrough coevolution.

These causal models\nare built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us\nto infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal\ngraphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step\nto infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal\nmodels. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional\ndistributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation,\nthis framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular\ndynamic systems.

We assert that qualifying as an AMA requires\nmore than what state-of-the-art alignment techniques aim to achieve: not only\nmust AMAs be able to discern ethically problematic situations, they should also\nbe able to actively reason about them, navigating between conflicting values\noutside of those embedded in the alignment phase.

To alleviate these problems, we propose\nScore-informed Neural Operator (SciNO), a probabilistic generative model in\nsmooth function spaces designed to stably approximate the Hessian diagonal and\nto preserve structural information during the score modeling. Empirical results\nshow that SciNO reduces order divergence by 42.7% on synthetic graphs and by\n31.5% on real-world datasets on average compared to DiffAN, while maintaining\nmemory efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, we propose a probabilistic\ncontrol algorithm for causal reasoning with autoregressive models that\nintegrates SciNO's probability estimates with autoregressive model priors,\nenabling reliable data-driven causal ordering informed by semantic information.\nConsequently, the proposed method enhances causal reasoning abilities of LLMs\nwithout additional fine-tuning or prompt engineering."}

To address this gap, we introduce BlindSpot, a framework built upon\na taxonomy of 15 operational bias dimensions (e.g., disfluency, speaker, topic)\nfor the identification and quantification of these biases. BlindSpot leverages\nan LLM as a zero-shot classifier to derive categorical distributions for each\nbias dimension in a pair of transcript and its summary. The bias is then\nquantified using two metrics: Fidelity Gap (the JS Divergence between\ndistributions) and Coverage (the percentage of source labels omitted). Using\nBlindSpot, we conducted an empirical study with 2500 real call transcripts and\ntheir summaries generated by 20 LLMs of varying scales and families (e.g., GPT,\nLlama, Claude). Our analysis reveals that biases are systemic and present\nacross all evaluated models, regardless of size or family."}

ACII first identifies the contribution of each channel in the smashed\ndata to model training using Shannon entropy. Following this, CGC groups the\nchannels based on their entropy and performs group-wise adaptive compression to\nshrink the transmission volume without compromising training accuracy.\nExtensive experiments across various datasets validate that our proposed SL-ACC\nframework takes considerably less time to achieve a target accuracy than\nstate-of-the-art benchmarks."}

In RLVR, rewards are derived from verifiable\nsignals-such as passing unit tests in code generation or matching correct\nanswers in mathematical reasoning. While effective, this requirement largely\nconfines RLVR to domains with automatically checkable outcomes. To overcome\nthis, we extend the RLVR paradigm to open-ended tasks by integrating\nrubric-based rewards, where carefully designed rubrics serve as structured,\nmodel-interpretable criteria for automatic scoring of subjective outputs. We\nconstruct, to our knowledge, the largest rubric reward system to date, with\nover 10,000 rubrics from humans, LLMs, or a hybrid human-LLM collaboration.\nImplementing rubric-based RL is challenging; we tackle these issues with a\nclear framework and present an open-sourced Qwen-30B-A3B model with notable\ngains: 1) With only 5K+ samples, our system improves by +5.2% on open-ended\nbenchmarks (especially humanities), outperforming a 671B DeepSeek-V3 model by\n+2.4%, while preserving general and reasoning abilities. 2) Our method provides\nfine-grained stylistic control, using rubrics as anchors to mitigate the\n\"AI-like\" tone and produce more human-like, expressive responses.

This version is a pre-MIT Press publication\n  version", "summary": "Detecting content generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for\npreventing misuse and building trustworthy AI systems. Although existing\ndetection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD)\nscenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to\nfeatures used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of\nLLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively\ncapture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between\nLLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this\nhypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural\nactivation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we\npropose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method.\nSpecifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of\nLGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better\nidentify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of\nthe text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a\nprecomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms\nall baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD\nscenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and\nmainstream attacks.

In this\nwork, we introduce OptimalThinkingBench, a unified benchmark that jointly\nevaluates overthinking and underthinking in LLMs and also encourages the\ndevelopment of optimally-thinking models that balance performance and\nefficiency. Our benchmark comprises two sub-benchmarks: OverthinkingBench,\nfeaturing simple queries in 72 domains, and UnderthinkingBench, containing 11\nchallenging reasoning tasks. Using novel thinking-adjusted accuracy metrics, we\nperform extensive evaluation of 33 different thinking and non-thinking models\nand show that no model is able to optimally think on our benchmark. Thinking\nmodels often overthink for hundreds of tokens on the simplest user queries\nwithout improving performance.

In this work, we analyze specific properties which make a benchmark\nmore reliable for such decisions, and interventions to design higher-quality\nevaluation benchmarks. We introduce two key metrics that show differences in\ncurrent benchmarks: signal, a benchmark's ability to separate better models\nfrom worse models, and noise, a benchmark's sensitivity to random variability\nbetween training steps. We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better\nsignal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale,\nand those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error. These\nresults suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful\nbenchmarks, so we introduce three interventions designed to directly affect\nsignal or noise. For example, we propose that switching to a metric that has\nbetter signal and noise (e.g., perplexity rather than accuracy) leads to better\nreliability and improved scaling law error. We also find that filtering noisy\nsubtasks, to improve an aggregate signal-to-noise ratio, leads to more reliable\nmulti-task evaluations. We also find that averaging the output of a model's\nintermediate checkpoints to reduce noise leads to consistent improvements. We\nconclude by recommending that those creating new benchmarks, or selecting which\nexisting benchmarks to use, aim for high signal and low noise. We use 30\nbenchmarks for these experiments, and 375 open-weight language models from 60M\nto 32B parameters, resulting in a new, publicly available dataset of 900K\nevaluation benchmark results, totaling 200M instances."}
