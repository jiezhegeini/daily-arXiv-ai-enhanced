### [1] [Cross-device Zero-shot Label Transfer via Alignment of Time Series Foundation Model Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06966)
*Neal G. Ravindra,Arijit Sehanobish*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 通过无监督的跨域对齐方法，将临床可穿戴设备（如actigraphy）的高质量标签迁移到消费级可穿戴设备（如Apple Watch）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动标注消费级可穿戴设备数据成本高昂且难以扩展，而高质量的临床可穿戴设备标签已存在，存在标签迁移的需求。

Method: 利用时间序列基础模型（TSFM）将不同设备的数据投影到共享的潜在嵌入空间，并采用对抗性学习框架（Adversarial Alignment of TSFM Embeddings）来对齐源域和目标域的嵌入表示，从而实现跨设备标签迁移。

Result: 在不同设备类型之间成功迁移了标签，无需配对数据。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效地将在临床可穿戴设备上获得的高质量标签迁移到消费级可穿戴设备上，解决了消费级可穿戴设备标签稀疏的问题。

Abstract: High-quality, medically validated labels exist for clinical actigraphy data
but not for ubiquitous consumer wearables like the Apple Watch. Manually
labeling wearables data is expensive and doesn't scale. This paper offers a
novel framework that transfers valuable labels from a source domain (e.g.,
actigraphy) to a target domain (e.g., Apple Watch) without requiring paired
data. Instead of working with raw time-series signals, we project both domains
into a shared latent embedding space using time-series foundation models
(TSFMs) and develop a new framework to align the cross-device representations.
Our method, Adversarial Alignment of TSFM Embeddings forces the distributions
of source and target embeddings to align within this space, facilitating label
transfer across device type.

### [2] [Cross-field SNR Analysis and Tensor Channel Estimation for Multi-UAV Near-field Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06967)
*Tianyu Huo,Jian Xiong,Yiyan Wu,Songjie Yang,Bo Liu,Wenjun Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: In 6G networks, distributed ELAA formed by multi-UAVs can improve spectral efficiency. This paper studies channel estimation for these systems operating in the near-field, where conventional far-field assumptions fail. The hybrid spherical-plane wave model (HSPWM) is found to be a good trade-off between accuracy and tractability. Two algorithms, SD-OMP and tensor-OMP, are proposed for channel estimation under HSPWM. Tensor-OMP shows comparable performance to SD-OMP but with lower complexity and better scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional far-field assumptions are invalid for distributed ELAA in near-field multi-UAV systems. This paper aims to investigate and address channel estimation challenges in such systems.

Method: The paper derives closed-form SNR expressions for plane wave, spherical wave, and a hybrid spherical-plane wave model (HSPWM) in a distributed UPA scenario. It then proposes two channel estimation algorithms: spherical-domain orthogonal matching pursuit (SD-OMP) and tensor-OMP, which leverages the tensor formulation of the channel under HSPWM.

Result: The HSPWM offers a balance between modeling accuracy and analytical tractability. Simulation results show that tensor-OMP achieves comparable NMSE performance to SD-OMP while having reduced computational complexity and improved scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed tensor-OMP algorithm is an effective method for channel estimation in distributed near-field multi-UAV communication systems, offering a practical solution with lower complexity and better scalability compared to existing methods like SD-OMP.

Abstract: Extremely large antenna array (ELAA) is key to enhancing spectral efficiency
in 6G networks. Leveraging the distributed nature of multi-unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) systems enables the formation of distributed ELAA, which often
operate in the near-field region with spatial sparsity, rendering the
conventional far-field plane wave assumption invalid. This paper investigates
channel estimation for distributed near-field multi-UAV communication systems.
We first derive closed-form signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expressions under the
plane wave model (PWM), spherical wave model (SWM), and a hybrid
spherical-plane wave model (HSPWM), also referred to as the cross-field model,
within a distributed uniform planar array (UPA) scenario. The analysis shows
that HSPWM achieves a good balance between modeling accuracy and analytical
tractability. Based on this, we propose two channel estimation algorithms: the
spherical-domain orthogonal matching pursuit (SD-OMP) and the tensor-OMP. The
SD-OMP generalizes the polar domain to jointly consider elevation, azimuth, and
range. Under the HSPWM, the channel is naturally formulated as a tensor,
enabling the use of tensor-OMP. Simulation results demonstrate that tensor-OMP
achieves normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance comparable to SD-OMP,
while offering reduced computational complexity and improved scalability.

### [3] [Deep Learning-based Techniques for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems: State-of-the-Art, Challenges, and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06968)
*Murat Temiz,Yongwei Zhang,Yanwei Fu,Chi Zhang,Chenfeng Meng,Orhan Kaplan,Christos Masouros*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 深度学习技术在集成传感与通信（ISAC）系统中的应用和研究进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISAC被视为6G及未来网络的关键技术，但传统方法在计算复杂度和资源受限方面存在挑战。深度学习（DL）方法能以较低的计算复杂度提供高效的解决方案，适用于实时系统。

Method: 对现有基于DL的ISAC技术进行全面、分类的综述，介绍了DL架构和ISAC基础知识。

Result: 总结了DL在波形设计、信道估计、传感信号处理、数据解调和干扰抑制等ISAC任务中的应用，并指出了各自的优缺点。

Conclusion: DL技术为ISAC系统设计提供了有前景的解决方案，但仍需克服挑战并探索未来研究方向。

Abstract: This article comprehensively reviews recent developments and research on deep
learning-based (DL-based) techniques for integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) systems. ISAC, which combines sensing and communication functionalities,
is regarded as a key enabler for 6G and beyond networks, as many emerging
applications, such as vehicular networks and industrial robotics, necessitate
both sensing and communication capabilities for effective operation. A unified
platform that provides both functions can reduce hardware complexity, alleviate
frequency spectrum congestion, and improve energy efficiency. However,
integrating these functionalities on the same hardware requires highly
optimized signal processing and system design, introducing significant
computational complexity when relying on conventional iterative or
optimization-based techniques. As an alternative to conventional techniques,
DL-based techniques offer efficient and near-optimal solutions with reduced
computational complexity. Hence, such techniques are well-suited for operating
under limited computational resources and low latency requirements in real-time
systems. DL-based techniques can swiftly and effectively yield near-optimal
solutions for a wide range of sophisticated ISAC-related tasks, including
waveform design, channel estimation, sensing signal processing, data
demodulation, and interference mitigation. Therefore, motivated by these
advantages, recent studies have proposed various DL-based approaches for ISAC
system design. After briefly introducing DL architectures and ISAC
fundamentals, this survey presents a comprehensive and categorized review of
state-of-the-art DL-based techniques for ISAC, highlights their key advantages
and major challenges, and outlines potential directions for future research.

### [4] [Modeling the Doppler Shift in Cislunar Environment with Gaussian Mixture Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07134)
*Baris Donmez,Sebastien Loranger,Gunes Karabulut Kurt*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究了月球南极（LSP）基于不同倾角的星间链路（ISL）的射频（RF）多普勒频移分布特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究月球南极（LSP）星间链路（ISL）在不同倾角下的射频（RF）多普勒频移分布特性，以了解其变化规律。

Method: 使用高斯混合模型（GMM）来拟合不同倾角下的多普勒频移分布，并使用Kullback-Leibler（KL）散度和加权均值相对差（WMRD）作为评估指标。

Result: 当倾角偏离参考轨道达80°时，ISL多普勒频移可达±1.89 ppm。GMM拟合的WMRD和KL散度值分别高达0.6575和2.2963。

Conclusion: 高斯混合模型（GMM）最适合描述具有1°倾角间隔的多普勒频移分布，并且研究了其拟合优度。

Abstract: This study investigates the RF-based Doppler shift distribution
characterization of the Lunar South Pole (LSP) based inter-satellite link (ISL)
in varying inclination. Doppler shift in parts per million (ppm) is determined
and analyzed, as it provides an independence from the carrier frequency. Due to
unknown relative velocity states duration, the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is
found to be the best fitting distribution for ISLs with $1^\circ$ inclination
interval Doppler shift with respect to a predetermined satellite.
Goodness-of-fit is investigated and quantified with Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence and weighted mean relative difference (WMRD) error metrics.
Simulation results show that ISL Doppler shifts reach up to $\pm1.89$ ppm as
the inclination of the other orbit deviates higher from the reference orbit,
inclining $80^\circ$. Regarding the error measurements of GMM fitting, the WMRD
and KL divergence metrics for ISL take values up to 0.6575 and 2.2963,
respectively.

### [5] [Impact of Fading Correlation on the High-SNR Regime of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07172)
*Paula Isabel Tilleria Lucero,Bryan Fernando Sarango Rodríguez,Fernando Darío Almeida García,José Cândido Silveira Santos Filho*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本研究通过精确的渐近分析解决了RIS辅助无线系统在固定分集增益、受限空间相关性和高信噪比(SNR)近似问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服现有RIS辅助无线系统分析中存在的固定分集增益、受限空间相关性以及在高信噪比下近似失效等局限性。

Method: 对SNR分布的左尾进行精确渐近分析，并考虑任意相关的Nakagami-m衰落信道，以处理一般相关性以及可变分集和编码增益。

Result: 衰落相关性导致概率密度函数(PDF)和累积分布函数(CDF)的渐近行为在对数-dB尺度上发生左移（表现为直线段的左移）。线性系数量化这种左移，而角度系数不受影响。线性系数对相关性的高敏感性源于所有边缘渐近项的聚合贡献。

Conclusion: 衰落相关性对RIS辅助无线系统在高信噪比下的性能有显著影响，并且这种影响可以通过对PDF和CDF左尾的渐近分析来量化。

Abstract: This paper addresses three critical limitations in previous analyses of
RIS-aided wireless systems: propagation environments with fixed diversity gain,
restricted spatial correlation profiles, and approximation methods that fail to
capture the system behavior in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. To
overcome these challenges, we conduct an exact asymptotic analysis focused on
the left tail of the SNR distribution, which plays a critical role in high-SNR
system performance. Additionally, to account for general correlation profiles
and fading environments with variable diversity and coding gains, we consider
arbitrarily correlated Nakagami-m fading channels. The analytical results show
that fading correlation induces a horizontal shift in the asymptotic behavior
-- represented as a straight line in the log-dB scale -- of the PDF and CDF,
displacing these curves to the left. The asymptotic linear coefficient
quantifies this shift, while the angular coefficient remains unaffected.
Moreover, the results reveal that the high sensitivity of the linear
coefficient to correlation arises from the aggregated contribution of all
marginal asymptotic terms, effectively capturing each channel's correlation
characteristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于硬件限制，毫米波 MIMO 系统不能仅依赖数字预编码。混合预编码通过结合数字和射频技术，在性能和成本之间取得平衡，解决了信号混频器和模数转换器的局限性。此外，OFDM 在毫米波系统中会遇到高 PAPR 和 OOB 排放问题，射频预编码器和用户组合器中的相位控制管（PS）损伤也会导致相位误差。

Conclusion: 所提出的 WMMSE-BCD 方法可以有效地解决混合 MU-MIMO-OFDM 系统中的鲁棒数字-射频预编码优化问题，以最大化下行链路和速率。

Abstract: The deployment of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems cannot rely solely on digital precoding due to hardware
constraints. Instead, hybrid precoding, which combines digital and radio
frequency (RF) techniques, has emerged as a potential alternative. This
approach strikes a balance between performance and cost, addressing the
limitations of signal mixers and analog-to-digital converters in mmWave
systems. mmWave systems are designed to function in wideband channels with
frequency selectivity, necessitating the use of orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM) to mitigate dispersive channels. However, OFDM faces
several challenges. First, it suffers from a high peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR) due to the linear combination of subcarriers. Second, it suffers from
out-of-band (OOB) emissions due to the sharp spectral transitions of OFDM
subcarriers and windowing-induced spectral leakage. Furthermore, phase shifter
(PS) impairments at the RF transmitter precoder and the user combiner represent
a limitation in practical mmWave systems, leading to phase errors. This work
addresses these challenges.
  We study the problem of robust digital-RF precoding optimization for the
downlink sum-rate maximization in hybrid multi-user (MU) MIMO-OFDM systems
under maximum transmit power, PAPR, and OOB emission constraints. The
formulated maximization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve. We
propose a weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) based block coordinate
descent (BCD) method to iteratively optimize digital-RF precoders at the
transmitter and digital-RF combiners at the users. Low-cost and scalable
optimization approaches are proposed to efficiently solve the BCD subproblems.
Extensive simulation results are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the
proposed approaches and exhibit their superiority relative to well-known
benchmarks.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够从单个行波管频率产生正确的直流偏置，并实现了近乎垂直方向的单波束控制，但理论计算未考虑阻抗匹配的影响。

Conclusion: 波控RIS是一种有前景的技术，可以简化RIS设计并实现反射控制，但需要进一步研究阻抗匹配的影响和优化波束控制能力。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), an emerging technology proposed
for inclusion in next generation wireless communication systems, are
programmable surfaces that can adaptively reflect incident electromagnetic
radiation in different desired directions. To reduce the complexity and
physical profile of conventional RIS designs, a novel concept known as
Wave-Controlled RIS has been proposed, in which standing waves along a
transmission line are used to generate the required dc bias for reflective
control. This paper shows the design of such a Wave-Controlled RIS and its
biasing transmission line. The effectiveness of this approach in generating the
correct dc bias from a single standing wave frequency is analyzed through both
theoretical modeling and experimental validation, which uncovered a dependence
on impedance matching not accounted for by the theory. Additionally, the
potential for reflective control using only a single standing wave frequency on
the biasing transmission line is explored, demonstrating the ability of
single-beam steering toward angles near broadside.

*Lianming Hu,Xiaotong Zhang,Kamal Youcef-Toumi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种眼动特征引导的去基线漂移（FGD）方法，用于减轻眼电信号（EOG）中的漂移伪影，通过识别眼动特征来重建和校正基线漂移，从而提高EOG信号的准确性，并已在仿真和真实世界数据中得到验证。

Method: 提出一种眼动特征引导的去基线漂移（FGD）方法，利用主动眼动特征识别来重建提取的EOG基线，并自适应地校正信号漂移，同时保持EOG波形的形态完整性。

Result: 在仿真数据中，平均误差降低到0.896度（减少36.29%）；在真实世界数据中，平均误差降低到1.033度（减少26.53%）。

Conclusion: FGD方法能够有效减轻EOG信号的漂移伪影，在真实世界数据中表现优于传统去漂移技术，能够提高人类表现增强等实际应用的效果。

Abstract: Electrooculography (EOG) is widely used for gaze tracking in Human-Robot
Collaboration (HRC). However, baseline drift caused by low-frequency noise
significantly impacts the accuracy of EOG signals, creating challenges for
further sensor fusion. This paper presents an Eye Movement Feature-Guided
De-drift (FGD) method for mitigating drift artifacts in EOG signals. The
proposed approach leverages active eye-movement feature recognition to
reconstruct the feature-extracted EOG baseline and adaptively correct signal
drift while preserving the morphological integrity of the EOG waveform. The FGD
is evaluated using both simulation data and real-world data, achieving a
significant reduction in mean error. The average error is reduced to
0.896{\deg} in simulation, representing a 36.29% decrease, and to 1.033{\deg}
in real-world data, corresponding to a 26.53% reduction. Despite additional and
unpredictable noise in real-world data, the proposed method consistently
outperforms conventional de-drifting techniques, demonstrating its
effectiveness in practical applications such as enhancing human performance
augmentation.

Abstract: The design and technology development of 6G-enabled networked intelligent
systems needs an accurate real-time channel model as the cornerstone. However,
with the new requirements of 6G-enabled networked intelligent systems, the
conventional channel modeling methods face many limitations. Fortunately, the
multi-modal sensors equipped on the intelligent agents bring timely
opportunities, i.e., the intelligent integration and mutually beneficial
mechanism between communications and multi-modal sensing could be investigated
based on the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. In this case, the
mapping relationship between physical environment and electromagnetic channel
could be explored via Synesthesia of Machines (SoM). This article presents a
novel multi-modal intelligent channel modeling (MMICM) framework for 6G-enabled
networked intelligent systems, which establishes a nonlinear model between
multi-modal sensing and channel characteristics, including large-scale and
small-scale channel characteristics. The architecture and features of proposed
intelligent modeling framework are expounded and the key technologies involved
are also analyzed. Finally, the system-engaged applications and potential
research directions of MMICM framework are outlined.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: EHG信号结合KLT降噪和生理学特征提取可实现对早产的高精度预测，优于单独使用TOCO信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早产是新生儿死亡的主要原因，早期检测至关重要。现有EHG和TOCO预测模型存在类别不平衡、过采样不当和特征生理学意义有限等问题。

Method: 提出了一种结合了鲁棒预处理、生理学特征提取（MFCC、小波系数统计描述、功率谱峰值）和KLT降噪的机器学习流程。在TPEHGT数据集上评估了多种分类器（Logistic回归、SVM、随机森林、梯度提升、MLP、CatBoost）。

Result: CatBoost分类器结合KLT降噪在TPEHGT数据集固定区间段上达到了97.28%的准确率和0.9988的AUC。消融研究证实了KLT降噪和生理学特征的重要性。EHG信号单独预测效果与包含TOCO信号的效果相当，表明EHG信号足够用于早产检测。

Conclusion: 结合降噪和领域相关特征的机器学习模型可以实现高精度、鲁棒且临床可解释的早产预测，有助于开发成本效益高、易于获取的早产预测工具，尤其适用于资源匮乏的医疗环境。

Abstract: Preterm birth (PTB), defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation, is a
leading cause of neonatal mortality and long term health complications. Early
detection is essential for enabling timely medical interventions.
Electrohysterography (EHG) and tocography (TOCO) are promising non invasive
tools for PTB prediction, but prior studies often suffer from class imbalance,
improper oversampling, and reliance on features with limited physiological
relevance. This work presents a machine learning pipeline incorporating robust
preprocessing, physiologically grounded feature extraction, and rigorous
evaluation. Features were extracted from EHG (and TOCO) signals using Mel
frequency cepstral coefficients, statistical descriptors of wavelet
coefficients, and peaks of the normalized power spectrum. Signal quality was
enhanced via Karhunen Lo\`eve Transform (KLT) denoising through eigenvalue
based subspace decomposition. Multiple classifiers, including Logistic
Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting,
Multilayer Perceptron, and CatBoost, were evaluated on the TPEHGT dataset. The
CatBoost classifier with KLT denoising achieved the highest performance on
fixed interval segments of the TPEHGT dataset, reaching 97.28% accuracy and an
AUC of 0.9988. Ablation studies confirmed the critical role of both KLT
denoising and physiologically informed features. Comparative analysis showed
that including TOCO signals did not substantially improve prediction over EHG
alone, highlighting the sufficiency of EHG for PTB detection. These results
demonstrate that combining denoising with domain relevant features can yield
highly accurate, robust, and clinically interpretable models, supporting the
development of cost effective and accessible PTB prediction tools, particularly
in low resource healthcare settings.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: SA-OOSC是一个利用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）进行知识蒸馏的语义通信框架，通过情境感知的重要性分配，实现了高效的语义编码，解决了传统OOSC系统固定分配重要性值的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面向对象语义通信（OOSC）系统存在一个关键限制，即无论物体在当前情境下的相关性如何，都为其分配固定的重要性值。

Method: 该框架利用MLLM识别物体在图像中的情境增强（SA）语义重要性，并通过MLLM标注数据进行知识蒸馏，使向量化/去向量化网络和JSCC编码器/解码器能够根据情境重要性动态分配编码资源，区分高重要性与低重要性物体。框架包含三个核心创新：MLLM引导的知识蒸馏流程、重要性加权的变长JSCC框架以及促进JSCC框架内知识蒸馏的新型损失函数设计。

Result: 实验结果表明，与传统的语义通信系统相比，该框架在编码效率上表现更优，并发布了开源的MLLM标注和人工验证的数据集，为未来的语义通信研究树立了新的基准。

Conclusion: SA-OOSC框架通过情境感知的重要性分配，显著提高了语义通信的编码效率，并为该领域的研究提供了新的数据集和方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces SA-OOSC, a multimodal large language models
(MLLM)-distilled semantic communication framework that achieves efficient
semantic coding with scenario-aware importance allocations. This approach
addresses a critical limitation of existing object-oriented semantic
communication (OOSC) systems - assigning static importance values to specific
classes of objects regardless of their contextual relevance. Our framework
utilizes MLLMs to identify the scenario-augmented (SA) semantic importance for
objects within the image. Through knowledge distillation with the
MLLM-annotated data, our vectorization/de-vectorization networks and JSCC
encoder/decoder learn to dynamically allocate coding resources based on
contextual significance, i.e., distinguishing between high-importance objects
and low-importance according to the SA scenario information of the task. The
framework features three core innovations: a MLLM-guided knowledge distillation
pipeline, an importance-weighted variable-length JSCC framework, and novel loss
function designs that facilitate the knowledge distillation within the JSCC
framework. Experimental validation demonstrates our framework's superior coding
efficiency over conventional semantic communication systems, with open-sourced
MLLM-annotated and human-verified datasets established as new benchmarks for
future research in semantic communications.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method for accurately estimating the relative position
between two nodes with unknown locations in a diffusion-based molecular
communication environment. A specialized node structure is designed, combining
a central absorbing receiver with multiple transmitters placed at predefined
spherical coordinates. Pilot molecules are released, and their absorption time
and concentration are measured. By partitioning the spherical coordinate space,
these spatially distinct measurements serve as input to a multilayer perceptron
(MLP)-based model. The proposed method significantly improves the precision of
distance and direction estimation. Simulation results demonstrate localization
accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of the neural network model in capturing
the underlying physical characteristics.

*Ashish Patwari,Andrés Alayón Glazunov*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: MESAs不鲁棒，MFRSAs解决了传感器失效的问题，但仍有隐藏依赖。本研究提出了一种评估TRSLAs对双传感器失效鲁棒性的系统框架，并分析了现有TRSLAs的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最大化经济稀疏阵列（MESAs）虽然在孔洞自由差值协方差（DCA）方面经济高效，但对传感器故障非常敏感。多重冗余稀疏阵列（MFRSAs）通过冗余提高了鲁棒性，但仍存在隐藏依赖问题，限制了其完全鲁棒性。

Method: 提出一个系统框架来评估三倍冗余稀疏线性阵列（TRSLAs）在所有可能的双传感器失效情况下的鲁棒性。

Result: 对现有文献中代表性的TRSLAs进行了失效分析，发现它们在某些特定的传感器对失效时存在隐藏的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 现有的TRSLAs并非完全鲁棒，本研究提出的评估框架可以客观地评估任何TRSLAs的鲁棒性，并具有重要的参考价值。

Abstract: As the field of sparse arrays progressed, numerous array designs have been
introduced with a focus on larger apertures and higher degrees of freedom
(DOFs), resulting in maximally economic sparse arrays (MESAs) that operate with
the least number of sensors required to provide a given aperture while ensuring
a hole-free difference coarray (DCA). Consequently, MESAs are least robust to
sensor failures and cannot afford the failure of even a single sensor.
Multifold redundant sparse arrays (MFRSAs) provide a practical solution to the
problem of sensor failures in sparse arrays by making sure that the array
contains enough sensor pairs necessary to produce each spatial lag multiple
times. Owing to this property, a \b{eta}-fold redundant array can withstand
simultaneous failure of at least \b{eta}-1 sensors without losing the hole-free
DCA property. Nevertheless, MFRSAs are also prone to hidden dependencies that
prevent them from being fully robust. In this work, we present a systematic
framework to evaluate the robustness of triple redundant sparse linear arrays
(TRSLAs) against all possible two-sensor failures. After detailing the proposed
approach, we present the failure analysis of representative TRSLAs available in
existing literature. It is found that existing TRSLAs have some hidden
vulnerabilities against the failure of some peculiar sensor pairs.
Corresponding MATLAB programs and numerical simulations are provided for
evaluation and use by the array processing community. The proposed approach has
a great archival value as it can evaluate the robustness of any present or
future TRSLAs through objective means.

Motivation: 为了应对时变毫米波信道动态性的挑战，通信符号检测和空中计算（AirComp）操作与信道跟踪并行执行，解决了现有技术中通常假设信道信息完美已知的局限性。

Method: 提出一种联合信道和数据检测（JCDE）算法，使用双线性高斯信念传播（BiGaBP）算法，并结合信道预测（CP）算法，在每个估计窗口之前进行信道状态信息（CSI）和数据符号的并行估计。AirComp操作通过对残差信号进行最优组合来执行。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够有效地处理时变毫米波信道中的ICC问题，实现了通信和计算性能的最优平衡。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for integrated communication and computing (ICC)
transceiver design in time-varying millimeter-wave (mmWave) channels. In
particular, in order to cope with the dynamics of time-varying mmWave channels,
the detection of communication symbols and the execution of an over-the-air
computing (AirComp) operation are performed in parallel with channel tracking,
as opposed to existing state-of-the-art (SotA) on ICC where perfect knowledge
of the channel at all time instances is typically assumed. For clarity of
exposition, we consider a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) uplink scenario
where multiple single-antenna user equipment (UE) transmit to a base station
(BS) equipped with multiple antennas, such that each UE, or edge device (ED),
precodes its own transmit signal, while the BS, or access points (APs), also
performs receive beamforming. The proposed transceiver framework then estimates
channel state information (CSI) and data symbols in parallel, using a bilinear
Gaussian belief propagation (BiGaBP) algorithm for joint channel and data
detection (JCDE), aided by a channel prediction (CP) algorithm executed before
each estimation window at the BS. The AirComp operation is then executed by
means of an optimal combination of the residual signal. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in performing ICC in
challenging time-varying mmWave channels, with minimal degradation to both
communication and computing performance.

Abstract: In wireless sensor networks for reusable launchers, the electromagnetic
characterization and electromagnetic compatibility analyses are relevant due to
the reference operational scenario, which implies a complex, and sometimes
dynamic, electromagnetic environment. This work proposes a methodological
framework for the design of the network and for the analysis of the related
electromagnetic environment within the stages of a given launcher. Based on the
preliminary positioning of the network nodes, the framework prescribes a
workflow and the related toolset for determining the optimal network topology
focusing on the weights, the operation of the transceivers, and the overall
radiated power. The optimal network configuration is simulated by using
computational electromagnetics strategies in order to assess the
electromagnetic environment induced by the sensor network itself. The paper
provides some results concerning a case study for a specific launcher.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在超密集LEO卫星网络中更有效地减轻干扰并提高通信性能，需要一种能够灵活调整天线位置以重新配置天线几何形状的新型地面站天线架构。

Method: 提出了一种通过联合优化天线位置矢量（APV）和时变波束成形权重（AWV）来最大化地面站平均可实现速率的优化问题。利用拉格朗日对偶变换和二次变换将非凸优化问题转化为更易处理的形式，并开发了一种基于块坐标下降的迭代算法来交替优化APV和AWV直至收敛。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new architecture for the low-earth orbit (LEO)
satellite ground station aided by movable antenna (MA) array. Unlike
conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA), the MA array can flexibly adjust
antenna positions to reconfigure array geometry, for more effectively
mitigating interference and improving communication performance in ultra-dense
LEO satellite networks. To reduce movement overhead, we configure antenna
positions at the antenna initialization stage, which remain unchanged during
the whole communication period of the ground station. To this end, an
optimization problem is formulated to maximize the average achievable rate of
the ground station by jointly optimizing its antenna position vector (APV) and
time-varying beamforming weights, i.e., antenna weight vectors (AWVs). To solve
the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we adopt the Lagrangian dual
transformation and quadratic transformation to reformulate the objective
function into a more tractable form. Then, we develop an efficient block
coordinate descent-based iterative algorithm that alternately optimizes the APV
and AWVs until convergence is reached. Simulation results demonstrate that our
proposed MA scheme significantly outperforms traditional FPA by increasing the
achievable rate at ground stations under various system setups, thus providing
an efficient solution for interference mitigation in future ultra-dense LEO
satellite communication networks.

Abstract: In this work, we propose the design of modulation schemes that improve the
rate-energy region of fluid antenna-assisted simultaneous wireless information
and power transfer (SWIPT) systems. By considering the nonlinear
characteristics of practical energy harvesting circuits, we formulate a
dual-objective rate-energy (RE) region optimization problem to jointly maximize
the discrete-input mutual information (DIMI) and harvested current. The problem
is solved using the epsilon-constraint method and optimized constellations are
designed for various energy harvesting thresholds. We then evaluate the
performance of the optimized constellations under three different fluid antenna
(FA) port selection strategies: (i) Best Port, (ii) Fixed Port, and (iii)
Random Port. Our simulation results demonstrate significant performance gains
of optimized constellations over conventional constellations in both
information rate and energy harvesting.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication will be a key feature of future mobile
networks, enabling highly efficient systems and numerous new applications by
leveraging communication signals for sensing. In this paper, we analyze the
impact of arbitrary modulation alphabets on the sensing performance of
communication-centric OFDM systems as expected in the next-generation 6G

coherent successive target cancellation, and propose an enhanced version of
this algorithm. A systematic performance evaluation in multi-target scenarios,
including the effects of scattering, demonstrates that our proposed
interference mitigation methods achieve performance comparable to
sensing-optimal constant modulus signals while utilizing higher order
constellations for more efficient communications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决高速亚太赫兹无线通信中具有挑战性的同步约束问题，特别是为下一代星载通信系统提供超高数据速率的星际和深空通信。

Method: 提出了一种结合恒定模数算法（CMA）均衡器和盲定时误差检测器（TED）的波特间隔数字接收机架构。该TED利用CMA滤波器系数来估计定时误差，并驱动一个以符号速率两倍运行的Farrow插值器，从而在没有判决导向（DD）反馈或导频符号的情况下实现稳健的符号定时同步。

Result: 在140 GHz无线测试台和10 GHz带宽下，使用16-QAM调制进行了实验验证。结果表明，所提出的TED方案在比特误差率（BER）、误差向量幅度（EVM）和符号间干扰（ISI）抑制方面优于传统的盲TED，例如Gardner和Mueller & M"uller的盲实现。

Conclusion: 所提出的联合时钟恢复和均衡架构能够有效地实现高速亚太赫兹无线通信中的稳健符号定时同步，并且在BER、EVM和ISI抑制方面优于现有技术，这对于未来的空间通信系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper proposes and experimentally evaluates a joint clock recovery (CR)
and equalization architecture tailored for high-speed sub-terahertz (sub-THz)
wireless communication links. Specifically, a Baud-spaced digital receiver
architecture is investigated that combines a constant modulus algorithm (CMA)
equalizer with a blind timing error detector (TED), enabling robust symbol
timing synchronization without decision-directed (DD) feedback or pilot
symbols. The proposed TED leverages the CMA filter coefficients to estimate
timing errors, which are then used to drive a Farrow interpolator operating at
twice the symbol rate. The system is validated experimentally using a 140~GHz
wireless testbed with 16-QAM modulation over a 10~GHz bandwidth. Results show
that the proposed TED schemes outperform conventional blind TEDs, such as
Gardner and blind implementations of Mueller \& M\"uller, in terms of bit error
rate (BER), error vector magnitude (EVM), and intersymbol interference (ISI)
suppression. These capabilities are especially relevant to next-generation
spaceborne communication systems, where wideband sub-THz links are expected to
play a key role in enabling ultra-high-data-rate inter-satellite and deep-space
communications under challenging synchronization constraints.

Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) is a cornerstone of 6G,
enabling simultaneous environmental awareness and communication. This paper
explores radio SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) as a key ISAC

SLAM across different frequency bands, discussing trade-offs in coverage,
resolution, and hardware requirements. We also highlight opportunities for
integration with sensing, positioning, and cooperative networks. The findings
pave the way for standardized solutions in 6G applications such as autonomous

Abstract: We propose enhancements to score-based generative modeling techniques for
low-latency pilot-based channel estimation in a point-to-point single-carrier
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless system. Building on recent
advances in score-based models, we investigate a specific noise schedule design
and sampling acceleration by step-skipping to reduce the number of denoising
steps during inference. We additionally propose a single-step signal-to-noise
ratio informed denoiser as an extreme case of the step-skipping approach. Our
methods achieve significant latency reductions without performance degradation,
as demonstrated on a synthetic channel dataset representing an urban macrocell
MIMO communications scenario.
