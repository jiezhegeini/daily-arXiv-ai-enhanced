Industry-scale DLRMs are trained\nwith petabytes of recommendation data to serve billions of users every day. To\nutilize the rich user signals in the long user history, DLRMs have been scaled\nup to unprecedented complexity, up to trillions of floating-point operations\n(TFLOPs) per example. This scale, coupled with the huge amount of training\ndata, necessitates new storage and training algorithms to efficiently improve\nthe quality of these complex recommendation systems. In this paper, we present\na Request-Only Optimizations (ROO) training and modeling paradigm. ROO\nsimultaneously improves the storage and training efficiency as well as the\nmodel quality of recommendation systems. We holistically approach this\nchallenge through co-designing data (i.e., request-only data), infrastructure\n(i.e., request-only based data processing pipeline), and model architecture\n(i.e., request-only neural architectures). Our ROO training and modeling\nparadigm treats a user request as a unit of the training data. Compared with\nthe established practice of treating a user impression as a unit, our new\ndesign achieves native feature deduplication in data logging, consequently\nsaving data storage. Second, by de-duplicating computations and communications\nacross multiple impressions in a request, this new paradigm enables highly\nscaled-up neural network architectures to better capture user interest signals,\nsuch as Generative Recommenders (GRs) and other request-only friendly\narchitectures."}

Decomposition is done by applying machine learning to fit\na dual signal. Machine learning minimizes the loss function which compromises\nbetween fitting the original time series and penalizing irregularities of the\ndual signal. The latter includes terms based on the first and second order\nderivatives along time. To preserve special patterns, weighting of the\nregularization components of the loss function has been introduced based on\nStatistical Process Control methodology. The proposed decomposition can be\napplied as a smoothing algorithm against the mean and dispersion of the time\nseries. By isolating noise, the proposed decomposition can be seen as a\ndenoising algorithm. Two approaches of the learning process have been\nconsidered: sequential and jointly. The former approach learns the mean signal\nfirst and then dispersion. The latter approach fits the dual signal jointly.\nJointly learning can uncover complex relationships for the time series with\nheteroskedasticity. Learning has been set by solving the direct non-linear\nunconstrained optimization problem or by applying neural networks that have\nsequential or twin output architectures. Tuning of the loss function\nhyperparameters focuses on the isolated noise to be a stationary stochastic\nprocess without autocorrelation properties. Depending on the applications, the\nhyperparameters of the learning can be tuned towards either the discrete states\nby stepped signal or smoothed series. The decomposed dual signal can be\nrepresented on the 2D space and used to learn inherent structures, to forecast\nboth mean and dispersion, or to analyze cross effects in case of multiple time\nseries."}

This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more\nsophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more\nbroadly applicable.

In this paper, we move beyond\nsurface-level emotion tasks to investigate how LLMs reason about emotions\nthrough cognitive dimensions. Drawing from cognitive appraisal theory, we\nexamine whether LLMs produce coherent and plausible cognitive reasoning when\nreasoning about emotionally charged stimuli. We introduce a large-scale\nbenchmark on Cognitive Reasoning for Emotions - CoRE - to evaluate internal\ncognitive structures implicitly used by LLMs for emotional reasoning. Through a\nplethora of evaluation experiments and analysis, we seek to answer: (a) Are\nmodels more likely to implicitly rely on specific cognitive appraisal\ndimensions?, (b) What cognitive dimensions are important for characterizing\nspecific emotions?, and, (c) Can the internal representations of different\nemotion categories in LLMs be interpreted through cognitive appraisal\ndimensions? Our results and analyses reveal diverse reasoning patterns across\ndifferent LLMs. Our benchmark and code will be made publicly available."}

It is not a ``picture-in-the-head'' imagination. It is a faculty to\nmentally visualize coherent and holistic systems of concepts and causal links\nthat serve as semantic contexts for reasoning, decision making and prediction.\nOur position is that the role of cognitive imagination is still greatly\nunderestimated, and this creates numerous problems and diminishes the current\ncapabilities of AI. For instance, when reasoning, humans rely on imaginary\ncontexts to retrieve background info. They also constantly return to the\ncontext for semantic verification that their reasoning is still reasonable.\nThus, reasoning without imagination is blind. This paper is a call for greater\nattention to cognitive imagination as the next promising breakthrough in\nartificial intelligence. As an instrument for simulating cognitive imagination,\nwe propose semantic models -- a new approach to mathematical models that can\nlearn, like neural networks, and are based on probabilistic causal\nrelationships.
