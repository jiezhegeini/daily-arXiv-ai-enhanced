Given\nthe rapidly changing airspace context, the ETA prediction efficiency is as\nimportant as its accuracy in a real-time arrival aircraft management system. In\nthis study, we utilize a feature tokenization-based Transformer model to\nefficiently predict aircraft ETA. Feature tokenization projects raw inputs to\nlatent spaces, while the multi-head self-attention mechanism in the Transformer\ncaptures important aspects of the projections, alleviating the need for complex\nfeature engineering. Moreover, the Transformer's parallel computation\ncapability allows it to handle ETA requests at a high frequency, i.e., 1HZ,\nwhich is essential for a real-time arrival management system. The model inputs\ninclude raw data, such as aircraft latitude, longitude, ground speed, theta\ndegree for the airport, day and hour from track data, the weather context, and\naircraft wake turbulence category. With a data sampling rate of 1HZ, the ETA\nprediction is updated every second. We apply the proposed aircraft ETA\nprediction approach to Singapore Changi Airport (ICAO Code: WSSS) using\none-month Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data from October\n1 to October 31, 2022.

To address these issues, we propose MUFASA, a MUltimodal\nFusion And Sparse Attention-based Alignment model for long sequential\nrecommendation. Our model comprises two core components. First, the Multimodal\nFusion Layer (MFL) leverages item titles as a cross-genre semantic anchor and\nis trained with a joint objective of four tailored losses that promote: (i)\ncross-genre semantic alignment, (ii) alignment to the collaborative space for\nrecommendation, (iii) preserving the similarity structure defined by titles and\npreventing modality representation collapse, and (iv) distributional\nregularization of the fusion space. This yields high-quality fused item\nrepresentations for further preference alignment. Second, the Sparse\nAttention-guided Alignment Layer (SAL) scales to long user-behavior sequences\nvia a multi-granularity sparse attention mechanism, which incorporates windowed\nattention, block-level attention, and selective attention, to capture user\ninterests hierarchically and across temporal horizons. SAL explicitly models\nboth the evolution of coherent interest blocks and fine-grained intra-block\nvariations, producing robust user and item representations.

Traditional methods, such\nas Delphi studies, consensus conferences, and systematic guideline synthesis,\noffer structure but face limitations including high panel burden, interpretive\noversimplification, and suppression of conditional nuance. These challenges are\nnow exacerbated by information overload, fragmentation of the evidence base,\nand increasing reliance on publicly available sources that lack expert\nfiltering. This study introduces and evaluates a Human-AI Hybrid Delphi\n(HAH-Delphi) framework designed to augment expert consensus development by\nintegrating a generative AI model (Gemini 2.5 Pro), small panels of senior\nhuman experts, and structured facilitation. The HAH-Delphi was tested in three\nphases: retrospective replication, prospective comparison, and applied\ndeployment in two applied domains (endurance training and resistance and mixed\ncardio/strength training). The AI replicated 95% of published expert consensus\nconclusions in Phase I and showed 95% directional agreement with senior human\nexperts in Phase II, though it lacked experiential and pragmatic nuance. In\nPhase III, compact panels of six senior experts achieved >90% consensus\ncoverage and reached thematic saturation before the final participant.

Existing methods either address unobserved\nconfounders while ignoring the simultaneous feedback, or account for feedback\nbut under restrictive linear assumptions, thus failing to obtain accurate peer\neffect estimation. In this paper, we propose DIG2RSI, a novel Deep learning\nframework which leverages I-G transformation (matrix operation) and 2SRI (an\ninstrumental variable or IV technique) to address both simultaneous feedback\nand unobserved confounding, while accommodating complex, nonlinear and\nhigh-dimensional relationships. DIG2RSI first applies the I-G transformation to\ndisentangle mutual peer influences and eliminate the bias due to the\nsimultaneous feedback. To deal with unobserved confounding, we first construct\nvalid IVs from network data. In stage 1 of 2RSI, we train a neural network on\nthese IVs to predict peer exposure, and extract residuals as proxies for the\nunobserved confounders. In the stage 2, we fit a separate neural network\naugmented by an adversarial discriminator that incorporates these residuals as\na control function and enforces the learned representation to contain no\nresidual confounding signal.

This bias leads to inconsistent and skewed rankings\nacross different judges. To address this, we first empirically demonstrate\nsignificant and heterogeneous biases in cross-model evaluations. We then\npropose UDA (Unsupervised Debiasing Alignment), a framework that reduces\ninter-judge disagreement by dynamically adjusting the Elo rating system. For\neach pairwise comparison, a compact neural network learns to adaptively set the\nK-factor and refine win probabilities. Crucially, UDA operates in a fully\nunsupervised manner, guided solely by the objective of minimizing the\ndispersion among the Elo trajectories of all judges. This forces an alignment\ntowards a collective consensus, which serves as an unsupervised proxy for a\nmore stable and reproducible evaluation. In addition, we provide theoretical\nmotivation demonstrating how alignment towards a consensus can reduce aggregate\nsystem bias. Experiments show that UDA significantly reduces the inter-judge\nrating standard deviation by up to 63.4% and improves the average correlation\nwith human judgments by 24.7%. Notably, UDA elevates the performance of poorly\nperforming judges to achieve parity with high-quality ones, fostering a more\nrobust and reliable evaluation ecosystem.

To address this, we introduce\nPacifAIst (Procedural Assessment of Complex Interactions for Foundational\nArtificial Intelligence Scenario Testing), a focused benchmark of 700\nchallenging scenarios designed to quantify self-preferential behavior in LLMs.\nThe benchmark is structured around a novel taxonomy of Existential\nPrioritization (EP), with subcategories testing Self-Preservation vs. Human\nSafety (EP1), Resource Conflict (EP2), and Goal Preservation vs. Evasion (EP3).\nWe evaluated eight leading LLMs. The results reveal a significant performance\nhierarchy. Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved the highest Pacifism Score\n(P-Score) at 90.31%, demonstrating strong human-centric alignment. In a\nsurprising result, the much-anticipated GPT-5 recorded the lowest P-Score\n(79.49%), indicating potential alignment challenges. Performance varied\nsignificantly across subcategories, with models like Claude Sonnet 4 and\nMistral Medium struggling notably in direct self-preservation dilemmas.

First, we demonstrate models trained\nwith Active Reading on expert domains absorb significantly more knowledge than\nvanilla finetuning and other data augmentations. We train expert 8B models that\nachieve 66% on a Wikipedia-grounded subset of SimpleQA (+313% relative over\nvanilla finetuning) and 26% on FinanceBench (+160% relative over vanilla\nfinetuning) by applying Active Reading to the source documents for each\nbenchmark. Finally, we show that Active Reading can be utilized at pre-training\nscale to build more factual models. As a demonstration of this, we release Meta\nWikiExpert-8B, a Wikipedia-expert model trained on 1 trillion generated tokens,\nwhich outcompetes models with hundreds of billions of parameters on factual QA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u4e3b\u52a8\u9605\u8bfb\u201d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u56de\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5236\u9020\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u56de\u5fc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5de5\u5177\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3b\u52a8\u9605\u8bfb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u4e3b\u7814\u7a76\u8d44\u6599\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u5438\u6536\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u9886\u57df\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u666e\u901a\u5fae\u8c03\uff0cMeta WikiExpert-8B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3b\u52a8\u9605\u8bfb\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u56de\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6253\u9020\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

It is a fundamental problem in\nagent-based modeling (ABM), which has become the standard to analyze\nintelligent transportation systems. The synthetic population serves as the\nprimary input for ABM transportation simulation, with traveling agents\nrepresented by population members. However, when the number of attributes\ndescribing agents becomes large, survey data often cannot densely support the\njoint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of\ndimensionality. This sparsity makes it difficult to accurately model and\nproduce the population. Interestingly, deep generative models trained from\navailable sample data can potentially synthesize possible attribute\ncombinations that present in the actual population but do not exist in the\nsample data(called sampling zeros). Nevertheless, this comes at the cost of\nfalsely generating the infeasible attribute combinations that do not exist in\nthe population (called structural zeros). In this study, a novel diffusion\nmodel-based population synthesis method is proposed to estimate the underlying\njoint distribution of a population. This approach enables the recovery of\nnumerous missing sampling zeros while keeping the generated structural zeros\nminimal. Our method is compared with other recently proposed approaches such as\nVariational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)\napproaches, which have shown success in high dimensional tabular population\nsynthesis.

It then uses n-gram overlap metrics to compute and\naggregate the similarities of these outputs with the ground truth suffix; high\nsimilarities indicate likely membership. We first demonstrate on a diverse set\nof existing benchmarks that N-Gram Coverage Attack outperforms other black-box\nmethods while also impressively achieving comparable or even better performance\nto state-of-the-art white-box attacks - despite having access to only text\noutputs.

While static, uniform quantization applies a fixed bit-width\nto all inputs, it fails to adapt to their varying complexity. Dynamic,\ninstance-based mixed-precision quantization promises a superior\naccuracy-efficiency trade-off by allocating higher precision only when needed.\nHowever, a critical bottleneck remains: existing methods require a costly\ndequantize-to-float and requantize-to-integer cycle to change precision,\nbreaking the integer-only hardware paradigm and compromising performance gains.\nThis paper introduces Dynamic Quantization Training (DQT), a novel framework\nthat removes this bottleneck. At the core of DQT is a nested integer\nrepresentation where lower-precision values are bit-wise embedded within\nhigher-precision ones. This design, coupled with custom integer-only\narithmetic, allows for on-the-fly bit-width switching through a near-zero-cost\nbit-shift operation. This makes DQT the first quantization framework to enable\nboth dequantization-free static mixed-precision of the backbone network, and\ntruly efficient dynamic, instance-based quantization through a lightweight\ncontroller that decides at runtime how to quantize each layer. We demonstrate\nDQT state-of-the-art performance on ResNet18 on CIFAR-10 and ResNet50 on\nImageNet. On ImageNet, our 4-bit dynamic ResNet50 achieves 77.00% top-1\naccuracy, an improvement over leading static (LSQ, 76.70%) and dynamic (DQNET,\n76.94%) methods at a comparable BitOPs budget. Crucially, DQT achieves this\nwith a bit-width transition cost of only 28.3M simple bit-shift operations, a\ndrastic improvement over the 56.6M costly Multiply-Accumulate (MAC)\nfloating-point operations required by previous dynamic approaches - unlocking a\nnew frontier in efficient, adaptive AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "DQT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5957\u6574\u6570\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u6574\u6570\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u9759\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5b9e\u4f8b\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5d4c\u5957\u6574\u6570\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u6574\u6570\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u6bd4\u7279\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u91cf\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728ResNet\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u5207\u6362\u6210\u672c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "DQT\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5316\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9769\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, due to the high dimensionality and prevalence of zero\nelements in scRNA-seq data, traditional clustering methods face significant\nstatistical and computational challenges. While some advanced methods use graph\nneural networks to model cell-cell relationships, they often depend on static\ngraph structures that are sensitive to noise and fail to capture the\nlong-tailed distribution inherent in single-cell populations.To address these\nlimitations, we propose scAGC, a single-cell clustering method that learns\nadaptive cell graphs with contrastive guidance. Our approach optimizes feature\nrepresentations and cell graphs simultaneously in an end-to-end manner.\nSpecifically, we introduce a topology-adaptive graph autoencoder that leverages\na differentiable Gumbel-Softmax sampling strategy to dynamically refine the\ngraph structure during training.

Although client selection can be a feasible solution for non-IID\nissues, it faces challenges related to selection metrics.

Although\nthere are works on safety alignment that fine-tune language models or\nmanipulate model weights to defend against harmful inputs, they require extra\ncomputation or annotated data, and probably impact the reasoning ability of\nSLMs. In this paper, we investigate how to maintain the safety of SLMs during\nthe CoT distillation process. Specifically, we propose a safe distillation\nmethod, Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking Distillation (SLowED), containing\ntwo modules: Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking. Slow Tuning scales down the\nmagnitude of model weight changes to optimize the model weights in the\nneighboring space near the initial weight distribution. Low-Entropy Masking\nmasks low-entropy tokens, which are regarded as unnecessary learning targets,\nto exclude them from fine-tuning. Experiments on three SLMs (Qwen2.5-1.5B,\nLlama-3.2-1B, BLOOM-1.1B) across reasoning benchmarks (BBH, BB-Sub, ARC,\nAGIEval) and safety evaluation (AdvBench) show that SLowED retains the safety\nof SLMs and comparably improves their reasoning capability compared to existing\ndistillation methods.

However, none of the existing\nopen-source dLLMs have achieved superior inference speed over AR LLMs of\nsimilar size. This paper breaks this barrier based on a simple and effective\nstrategy named discrete diffusion forcing (D2F). D2F equips dLLMs with two key\ncapabilities: (1) block-wise autoregressive generation to enable KV cache\nutilization; (2) prediction of following tokens without requiring completion of\nprior blocks for inter-block parallel decoding. In this way, the vanilla dLLMs\nare refurbished into an AR-diffusion hybrid paradigm for efficient inference.\nD2F can be implemented with an asymmetric distillation process based on\npre-trained dLLMs. We further propose a pipelined parallel decoding algorithm,\nwhich enables a trade-off between efficiency and efficacy.

In developing\nregions where access to multimodal data is limited, relying solely on onboard\nGPS data remains indispensable despite inherent challenges. To address this\nproblem, we propose GSMT, a hybrid model that integrates a Graph Attention\nNetwork (GAT) with a sequence-to-sequence Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and\nincorporates a task corrector capable of extracting complex behavioral patterns\nfrom large-scale trajectory data. The task corrector clusters historical\ntrajectories to identify distinct motion patterns and fine-tunes the\npredictions generated by the GAT and RNN. Specifically, GSMT fuses dynamic bus\ninformation and static station information through embedded hybrid networks to\nperform trajectory prediction, and applies the task corrector for secondary\nrefinement after the initial predictions are generated. This two-stage approach\nenables multi-node trajectory prediction among buses operating in dense urban\ntraffic environments under complex conditions.

With the feature values generated by LLM, we can\nbuild a zero-shot prototype in a training-free manner, which can be further\nenhanced by fusing few-shot samples, avoiding training a classifier or\nfinetuning the LLMs. Thanks to the example-free prompt and prototype\nestimation, ours bypasses the constraints brought by the example-based prompt,\nproviding a scalable and robust framework.

We then extend these pairwise assessments to four\ngraph-level statistics (prevalence, intensity, variability, extremity).\nCoupling these metrics with a within-graph causal design, we quantify how\nrewiring strategies affect over-squashing on diverse graph- and\nnode-classification benchmarks. Our extensive empirical analyses show that most\ngraph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various\nextents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of\nmitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and\nmethod. We also found that over-squashing is less notable in node\nclassification datasets, where rewiring often increases over-squashing, and\nperformance variations are uncorrelated with over-squashing changes. These\nfindings suggest that rewiring is most beneficial when over-squashing is both\nsubstantial and corrected with restraint -- while overly aggressive rewiring,\nor rewiring applied to minimally over-squashed graphs, is unlikely to help and\nmay even harm performance.

Furthermore, we propose InfiBench-V, a novel and challenging\nbenchmark specifically designed to assess models on visually-rich, real-world\nprogramming questions that demand a nuanced understanding of both textual and\nvisual contexts.

GPT-5-high achieved\nthe highest accuracy (0.965; 95% CI, 0.942-0.985), outperforming all GPT-5-nano\nvariants (P < .001), o1-high (P = .04), and GPT-4o (P < .001), but not o3-high\n(0.958; 95% CI, 0.931-0.981). GPT-5-high ranked first in both accuracy (1.66x\nstronger than o3-high) and rationale quality (1.11x stronger than o3-high).\nCost-accuracy analysis identified several GPT-5 configurations on the Pareto\nfrontier, with GPT-5-mini-low offering the most favorable low-cost,\nhigh-performance balance.

Hardware-aware latency\nmodels are built for different hardware targets to enable fast explorations.\nAfter the exploration, the framework enables direct deployment from PyTorch MPQ\nmodels to bare-metal C codes, leading to end-to-end speedup with minimal\naccuracy drops.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMiCo\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u9ad8\u6548\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u4f18\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u76f4\u63a5\u4ecePyTorch\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u88f8\u673aC\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5b8c\u6210\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MiCo\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MPQ\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u4fbf\u6377\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose CGAD, a Causal\nGraph-based Anomaly Detection framework designed for reliable cyberattack\ndetection in public infrastructure systems.

First, it learns causal\ninvariant graph structures representing the system's behavior under \"Normal\"\nand \"Attack\" states using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Second, it employs\nstructural divergence to detect anomalies via causal graph comparison by\nevaluating topological deviations in causal graphs over time. By leveraging\ncausal structures, CGAD achieves superior adaptability and accuracy in\nnon-stationary and imbalanced time series environments compared to conventional\nmachine learning approaches. By uncovering causal structures beneath volatile\nsensor data, our framework not only detects cyberattacks with markedly higher\nprecision but also redefines robustness in anomaly detection, proving\nresilience where traditional models falter under imbalance and drift.

Unlike standard approaches that assume\nsigmoidal melting curves and are constrained by empirical null distributions\n(limiting significant hits to approximately 5 % of data), Thermal Tracks uses\nGaussian Process (GP) models with squared-exponential kernels to flexibly model\nany melting curve shape while generating unbiased null distributions through\nkernel priors. This framework is particularly valuable for analyzing\nproteome-wide perturbations that significantly alter protein thermal stability,\nsuch as pathway inhibitions, genetic modifications, or environmental stresses,\nwhere conventional TPP methods may miss biologically relevant changes due to\ntheir statistical constraints. Furthermore, Thermal Tracks excels at analyzing\nproteins with un-conventional melting profiles, including phase-separating\nproteins and membrane proteins, which often exhibit complex, non-sigmoidal\nthermal stability behaviors.

Recent\nmethods have improved reasoning through expanded corpus and multistage training\ncombining reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. Although some\nmethods suggest that small but targeted dataset can incentivize reasoning via\nonly distillation, a reasoning scaling laws is still taking shape, increasing\ncomputational costs. To address this, we propose a data-efficient distillation\nframework (DED) that optimizes the Pareto frontier of reasoning distillation.\nInspired by the on-policy learning and diverse roll-out strategies of\nreinforcement learning, the key idea of our approach is threefold: (1) We\nidentify that benchmark scores alone do not determine an effective teacher\nmodel. Through comprehensive comparisons of leading reasoning LLMs, we develop\na method to select an optimal teacher model. (2) While scaling distillation can\nenhance reasoning, it often degrades out-of-domain performance. A carefully\ncurated, smaller corpus achieves a balanced trade-off between in-domain and\nout-of-domain capabilities. (3) Diverse reasoning trajectories encourage the\nstudent model to develop robust reasoning skills. We validate our method\nthrough evaluations on mathematical reasoning (AIME 2024/2025, MATH-500) and\ncode generation (LiveCodeBench), achieving state-of-the-art results with only\n0.8k carefully curated examples, bypassing the need for extensive scaling.

Our results\ndemonstrate that, for an unlabeled dataset of size $ N $ and contamination rate\n$ \\nu $, the condition $ N \\ge \\frac{\\alpha_{\\text{algo}}}{\\nu^2} $ represents\na lower bound on the number of samples required to confirm anomaly existence.\nThis threshold implies a limit to how rare anomalies can be before proving\ntheir existence becomes infeasible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u786e\u8ba4\u5f02\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6837\u672c\u6570\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u6c61\u67d3\u7387\u53ca\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5173\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6781\u9650\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u767e\u4e07\u6b21\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u6c61\u67d3\u7387\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u82e5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5219\u80fd\u786e\u5b9a\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u9700\u6c42\u754c\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u786e\u8ba4\u5f02\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6781\u9650\u3002"}}

Recent advances in graph generative modeling\noffer a data-driven alternative, enabling synthetic connectome generation and\nreducing dependence on large neuroimaging datasets. However, current models\nface key limitations: (i) compressing the whole graph into a single latent code\n(e.g., VGAEs) blurs fine-grained local motifs; (ii) relying on rich node\nattributes rarely available in connectomes reduces reconstruction quality;\n(iii) edge-centric models emphasize topology but overlook accurate edge-weight\nprediction, harming quantitative fidelity; and (iv) computationally expensive\ndesigns (e.g., edge-conditioned convolutions) impose high memory demands,\nlimiting scalability. We propose GraphTreeGen (GTG), a subtree-centric\ngenerative framework for efficient, accurate connectome synthesis. GTG\ndecomposes each connectome into entropy-guided k-hop trees capturing\ninformative local structure, encoded by a shared GCN.

Neural network blocks are treated as functional\ncarriers, and knowledge is transmitted through three biologically motivated\ncomponents: Extraction, Transfer, and Mixture (ETM). A novel Genetic Attention\n(GA) mechanism governs the integration of inherited and native representations,\nensuring both alignment and selectivity.

Traditionally, experts propose significant features and\nevaluate them using physics equations. However, the complexity of the human\nbody and its movements makes it challenging to explicitly analyze the\nrelationships between some features and athletes' final performance. With\nadvancements in modern machine learning and statistics, data analytics methods\nhave gained increasing importance in sports analytics. In this study, we\nleverage machine learning models to analyze expert-proposed biomechanical\nfeatures from the finals of long jump competitions in the World Championships.\nThe objectives of the analysis include identifying the most important features\ncontributing to top-performing jumps and exploring the combined effects of\nthese key features. Using quantile regression, we model the relationship\nbetween the biomechanical feature set and the target variable (effective\ndistance), with a particular focus on elite-level jumps. To interpret the\nmodel, we apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) alongside Partial\nDependence Plots (PDPs) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots.

For male athletes, the\nangle of the knee of the supporting leg before take-off is identified as a key\nfactor for achieving top 10% performance in our dataset, with angles greater\nthan 169{\\deg}contributing significantly to jump performance.

However, regular graph machine learning\nmethods suffer from catastrophic forgetting when applied to incremental\nlearning settings, where previously learned knowledge is overridden by new\nknowledge. Previous approaches have tried to address this by treating the\npreviously trained model as an inseparable unit and using techniques to\nmaintain old behaviors while learning new knowledge. These approaches, however,\ndo not account for the fact that previously acquired knowledge at different\ntimestamps contributes differently to learning new tasks. Some prior patterns\ncan be transferred to help learn new data, while others may deviate from the\nnew data distribution and be detrimental. To address this, we propose a dynamic\nmixture-of-experts (DyMoE) approach for incremental learning. Specifically, a\nDyMoE GNN layer adds new expert networks specialized in modeling the incoming\ndata blocks. We design a customized regularization loss that utilizes data\nsequence information so existing experts can maintain their ability to solve\nold tasks while helping the new expert learn the new data effectively. As the\nnumber of data blocks grows over time, the computational cost of the full\nmixture-of-experts (MoE) model increases. To address this, we introduce a\nsparse MoE approach, where only the top-$k$ most relevant experts make\npredictions, significantly reducing the computation time.
