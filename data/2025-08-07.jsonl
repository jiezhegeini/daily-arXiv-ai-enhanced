The system is built on a\nprevalent Two Tower retrieval framework, representing products using textual\nand structured attributes, which enables efficient retrieval via Approximate\nNearest Neighbour search. We demonstrate how the same model architecture can be\nadapted to serve three distinct recommendation tasks: similarity search,\ncomplementary product suggestions, and inspirational content discovery, by\nmodifying only a handful of components in either the model or the serving\nlogic. Extensive A/B testing over two years confirms significant gains in\nengagement and profit-based metrics across desktop and mobile app channels. Our\nresults show that a flexible, scalable architecture can serve diverse user\nintents with minimal maintenance overhead."}

We expand on that research by\nconducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded\nrepresentational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of\nidentity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about\nsignificant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to\nencourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious\nand caste representation in the outputs against the actual population\ndistribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and\n\"stickiness\" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We\nfind that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups\nfar beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to\nencourage representational diversity.

They primarily benefit a small subset of\nusers with abundant search behavior, while offering limited improvements for\nthe majority of users who exhibit only sparse search activity. To address the\nproblem of sparse search data in search-enhanced recommendation, we face two\nkey challenges: (1) how to learn useful search features for users with sparse\nsearch interactions, and (2) how to design effective training objectives under\nsparse conditions. Our idea is to leverage the features of users with rich\nsearch interactions to enhance those of users with sparse search interactions.\nBased on this idea, we propose GSERec, a method that utilizes message passing\non the User-Code Graphs to alleviate data sparsity in Search-Enhanced\nRecommendation. Specifically, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) with\nvector quantization to generate discrete codes, which connect similar users and\nthereby construct the graph. Through message passing on this graph, embeddings\nof users with rich search data are propagated to enhance the embeddings of\nusers with sparse interactions. To further ensure that the message passing\ncaptures meaningful information from truly similar users, we introduce a\ncontrastive loss to better model user similarities.

The review emphasizes\nthe need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting\nstrategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of\nthe recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and\nmitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction\ntuning, multi-agent reasoning, and external knowledge access via RAG\nframeworks. Key findings highlight the limitations of current metrics, the\nvalue of grounding outputs with validated external evidence, and the importance\nof domain-specific customization to improve factual consistency. Overall, the\nreview underlines the importance of building LLMs that are not only accurate\nand explainable but also tailored for domain-specific fact-checking. These\ninsights contribute to the advancement of research toward more trustworthy and\ncontext-aware language models."}

In this paper, we introduce a compositional on-the-fly synthesis\nframework that integrates the strengths of both approaches, focusing on large\nconjunctions of smaller LTLf formulas common in practice. This framework\napplies composition during game solving instead of automata (game arena)\nconstruction. While composing all intermediate results may be necessary in the\nworst case, pruning these results simplifies subsequent compositions and\nenables early detection of unrealizability. Specifically, the framework allows\ntwo composition variants: pruning before composition to take full advantage of\nminimization or pruning during composition to guide on-the-fly synthesis.\nCompared to state-of-the-art synthesis solvers, our framework is able to solve\na notable number of instances that other solvers cannot handle. A detailed\nanalysis shows that both composition variants have unique merits."}

A Comprehensive Analysis on Multimodal Representations for Recommendation", "comment": "Accepted as Full Research Papers at CIKM 2025", "summary": "Multimodal Recommender Systems aim to improve recommendation accuracy by\nintegrating heterogeneous content, such as images and textual metadata. While\neffective, it remains unclear whether their gains stem from true multimodal\nunderstanding or increased model complexity. This work investigates the role of\nmultimodal item embeddings, emphasizing the semantic informativeness of the\nrepresentations. Initial experiments reveal that embeddings from standard\nextractors (e.g., ResNet50, Sentence-Bert) enhance performance, but rely on\nmodality-specific encoders and ad hoc fusion strategies that lack control over\ncross-modal alignment. To overcome these limitations, we leverage Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generate multimodal-by-design embeddings via\nstructured prompts. This approach yields semantically aligned representations\nwithout requiring any fusion. Experiments across multiple settings show notable\nperformance improvements. Furthermore, LVLMs embeddings offer a distinctive\nadvantage: they can be decoded into structured textual descriptions, enabling\ndirect assessment of their multimodal comprehension. When such descriptions are\nincorporated as side content into recommender systems, they improve\nrecommendation performance, empirically validating the semantic depth and\nalignment encoded within LVLMs outputs. Our study highlights the importance of\nsemantically rich representations and positions LVLMs as a compelling\nfoundation for building robust and meaningful multimodal representations in\nrecommendation tasks."}

First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization\nprocess that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more\nuniform and disentangled IDs.

HarmonyGuard\nfeatures a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental\ncapabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent\nwithin HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured\nsecurity policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously\nupdating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective\nOptimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility\nAgent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning\nto evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their\noptimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that\nHarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up\nto 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance\nacross all tasks. Our project is available here:\nhttps://github.com/YurunChen/HarmonyGuard."}

Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of\ntransfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets\nand find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail\noff as more target points are selected for inclusion in training.

Although this challenge is critical, current research\nremains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios,\nlacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and\nutility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a\nmulti-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and\nobjective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard\nfeatures a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental\ncapabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent\nwithin HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured\nsecurity policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously\nupdating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective\nOptimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility\nAgent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning\nto evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their\noptimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that\nHarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up\nto 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance\nacross all tasks.

We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse.\nWe attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions\nin certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that\npreserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates\nthe style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation\nspace via an orthogonal deflation process.

However, a common challenge observed across\nmany replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses\nunder a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or\nincorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to\nvanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for\nlearning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.\nTo address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization\nframework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome\nconsistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs\nshow high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives\nmeaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and\nself-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective.

Object detection is an extension of classification that includes\nlocalization of the object via a bounding box within the sample.\nClassification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by\ncounting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the\nground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as\nequivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy\nwith a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or\noperator valuation of misclassifications.

The paper\nconcludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a\nnew domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of\nemergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology. This\nperspective shifts the focus from purely phenomenological definitions of\nemergence to understanding the internal dynamic transformations that enable\nthese systems to acquire capabilities that transcend their individual\ncomponents."}

First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization\nprocess that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more\nuniform and disentangled IDs.

A Comprehensive Analysis on Multimodal Representations for Recommendation", "comment": "Accepted as Full Research Papers at CIKM 2025", "summary": "Multimodal Recommender Systems aim to improve recommendation accuracy by\nintegrating heterogeneous content, such as images and textual metadata. While\neffective, it remains unclear whether their gains stem from true multimodal\nunderstanding or increased model complexity. This work investigates the role of\nmultimodal item embeddings, emphasizing the semantic informativeness of the\nrepresentations. Initial experiments reveal that embeddings from standard\nextractors (e.g., ResNet50, Sentence-Bert) enhance performance, but rely on\nmodality-specific encoders and ad hoc fusion strategies that lack control over\ncross-modal alignment. To overcome these limitations, we leverage Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generate multimodal-by-design embeddings via\nstructured prompts. This approach yields semantically aligned representations\nwithout requiring any fusion. Experiments across multiple settings show notable\nperformance improvements. Furthermore, LVLMs embeddings offer a distinctive\nadvantage: they can be decoded into structured textual descriptions, enabling\ndirect assessment of their multimodal comprehension. When such descriptions are\nincorporated as side content into recommender systems, they improve\nrecommendation performance, empirically validating the semantic depth and\nalignment encoded within LVLMs outputs. Our study highlights the importance of\nsemantically rich representations and positions LVLMs as a compelling\nfoundation for building robust and meaningful multimodal representations in\nrecommendation tasks."}

To achieve this goal, we\ndesign a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a\nCurriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.\nThe agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of\nadversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) on successful ones.
