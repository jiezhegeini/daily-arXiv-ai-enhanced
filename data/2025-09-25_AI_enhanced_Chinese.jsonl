When EV charging happens behind the meter (BTM), the\ncharging occurs on the customer side of the meter, which measures the overall\nelectricity consumption. In other words, the charging of the EV is considered\npart of the customer's load and not separately measured by the Distribution\nNetwork Operators (DNOs). DNOs require complete knowledge about the EV presence\nin their network. Identifying the EV charging demand is essential to better\nplan and manage the distribution grid. Unlike supervised methods, this paper\naddresses the problem of EV charging load identification in a non-nonintrusive\nmanner from low-frequency smart meter using an unsupervised learning approach\nbased on anomaly detection technique. Our approach does not require prior\nknowledge of EV charging profiles. It only requires real power consumption data\nof non-EV users, which are abundant in practice. We propose a deep temporal\nconvolution encoding decoding (TAE) network.

We design and evaluate\nthree new deep learning models, including a CNN classifier with\nSqueeze-and-Excitation blocks for channel-wise feature recalibration, a ResNet\nclassifier with dilated convolutions for multiscale temporal dependency\ncapture, and a novel CNNTransformer hybrid combining convolutional feature\nextraction with attention mechanisms for long-range temporal relationship\nmodeling. Tested on data from 54 subjects for six activities, all three models\nachieve over 94% accuracy for seen subjects, while CNNTransformer hybrid\nreaching the best accuracy of 72% for unseen subjects, a result that can be\nfurther improved by increasing the training population. This study demonstrates\nthe first successful ECG-only activity classification in multiple physical\nactivities, offering significant potential for developing next-generation\nwearables capable of simultaneous cardiac monitoring and activity recognition\nwithout additional motion sensors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe(ECG)\u8fdb\u884c\u516d\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u5355\u5143(IMU)\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5e26\u6709Squeeze-and-Excitation\u5757\u7684CNN\u3001\u5e26\u81a8\u80c0\u5377\u79ef\u7684ResNet\u4ee5\u53caCNN-Transformer\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u4f9d\u8d56IMU\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u548c\u9700\u8981\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eECG\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u4f5c\u4e3aIMU\u7684\u8865\u5145\u6216\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u4ec5\u7528ECG\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1. \u5e26\u6709Squeeze-and-Excitation\u5757\u7684CNN\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u9053\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u6821\u51c6\u30022. \u5e26\u6709\u81a8\u80c0\u5377\u79ef\u7684ResNet\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u6355\u83b7\u30023. \u65b0\u9896\u7684CNN-Transformer\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5377\u79ef\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u7a0b\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u572854\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5bf9\u516d\u79cd\u6d3b\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u89c1\u8fc7\uff08seen\uff09\u7684\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5747\u8d85\u8fc794%\u3002CNN-Transformer\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\uff08unseen\uff09\u7684\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u51c6\u786e\u738772%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8eECG\u7684\u5fc3\u810f\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u5fc3\u7535\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Based on the EEG signals from four frontal lobe channels, the network\naims to generate virtual channel EEG signals for other 13 important brain\nregions. The architecture of the network is a two-dimensional convolutional\nneural network and it includes a parallel module for temporal and spatial\ndomain feature extraction, followed by a feature fusion module. The public\nPRED+CT database, which includes multi-channel EEG signals from 119 subjects,\nwas selected to verify the constructed network. The results showed that the\naverage correlation coefficient between the generated virtual channel EEG\nsignals and the original real signals was 0.6724, with an average absolute\nerror of 3.9470.

A noise injection training strategy is further designed to\nenhance robustness against channel estimation errors. Since the proposed\nframework operates solely on estimated CSI without modifying waveforms or\nsignal processing pipelines, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing\ncommunication systems as a plugin.

Solely\nrelying on the multi-beam reference signal receiving power (RSRP), LSCM aims to\nmodel the localized statistical propagation environment by estimating the\nchannel angular power spectrum (APS). However, existing methods rely heavily on\ndrive test data with high collection costs and limited spatial coverage. In\nthis paper, we propose a measurement report (MR) data-driven framework for\nLSCM, exploiting the low-cost and extensive collection of MR data. The\nframework comprises two novel modules. The MR localization module addresses the\nissue of missing locations in MR data by introducing a semi-supervised method\nbased on hypergraph neural networks, which exploits multi-modal information via\ndistance-aware hypergraph modeling and hypergraph convolution for location\nextraction.

This study highlights that these errors often tend to be biased when\nusing mobile devices as sensors. We introduce a novel framework that models\nthese errors together with spatial correlation in radio propagation by\nembedding them as tunable parameters in the marginal log-likelihood function.\nThis enables ex-post calibration of location uncertainty during radio map\nconstruction.

By employing a simple port-selection mechanism\nthat leverages random channel superposition, CUMA can suppress inter-user\ninterference while keeping hardware costs low. Nevertheless, its ad-hoc\nport-selection strategy leaves considerable room for optimization. In this\nwork, we revisit CUMA and propose two adaptive single-RF port-selection schemes\nthat retain its simplicity while significantly enhancing performance. The first\none, referred to as exact optimal half-space (EOHS), dynamically selects the\nprojection direction that maximizes the instantaneous signal build-up across\nactive ports. To reduce complexity while preserving most of the gains, we\nfurthermore introduce a principal component analysis (PCA)-based scheme, which\naligns port partitioning with the dominant statistical direction of per-port\nchannel vectors. This method yields a closed-form low-complexity solution,\ncomplemented by a tractable analytical framework that provides a closed-form\nexpression for the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) probability density\nfunction (PDF). Simulation results corroborate the analysis, demonstrating that\nboth EOHS and PCA consistently outperform conventional CUMA across diverse user\ndensities, port counts, and FAS aperture sizes. Notably, PCA achieves\nperformance close to EOHS at a fraction of the computational cost. The proposed\nschemes scale effectively to large-user regimes, offering a compelling\ncomplexity-performance trade-off for next-generation multiple access systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "CUMA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u4f53\u5929\u7ebf\uff08FA\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u5740\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b83\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684FAMA\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0a\u652f\u6301\u6d77\u91cf\u8fde\u63a5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u4fe1\u9053\u53e0\u52a0\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u7aef\u53e3\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0cCUMA\u53ef\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u7528\u6237\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5176\u4e34\u65f6\u7aef\u53e3\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u4ecd\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5355\u5c04\u9891\u7aef\u53e3\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6848\uff08EOHS\u548cPCA\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301CUMA\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002EOHS\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u591f\u6700\u5927\u5316\u77ac\u65f6\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u800cPCA\u5219\u5229\u7528\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06\u7aef\u53e3\u5212\u5206\u4e0e\u5404\u7aef\u53e3\u4fe1\u9053\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002PCA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff08SIR\uff09\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\uff08PDF\uff09\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEOHS\u548cPCA\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u7528\u6237\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u7aef\u53e3\u6570\u91cf\u548cFA\u5b54\u5f84\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0b\uff0c\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684CUMA\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662fPCA\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1EOHS\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684CUMA\u6280\u672f\u867d\u7136\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0a\u652f\u6301\u6d77\u91cf\u8fde\u63a5\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e34\u65f6\u7aef\u53e3\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5355\u5c04\u9891\u7aef\u53e3\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6848\uff1a1. \u7cbe\u786e\u6700\u4f18\u534a\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08EOHS\uff09\uff1a\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u5411\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u77ac\u65f6\u4fe1\u53f7\u589e\u76ca\u3002 2. \u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\uff08PCA\uff09\uff1a\u5229\u7528PCA\u5c06\u7aef\u53e3\u5212\u5206\u4e0e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEOHS\u548cPCA\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u7528\u6237\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u7aef\u53e3\u6570\u91cf\u548cFA\u5b54\u5f84\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0b\uff0c\u5747\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfCUMA\u3002PCA\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4ec5\u4e3aEOHS\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1EOHS\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684EOHS\u548cPCA\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347CUMA\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u591a\u5740\u63a5\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
