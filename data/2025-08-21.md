### [1] [From Image Captioning to Visual Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14045)
*Admitos Passadakis,Yingjin Song,Albert Gatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种融合图片描述和故事叙述的方法，通过将视觉到语言的模型与语言到语言的转换结合，提升视觉故事讲述的质量，并引入了新的评估指标“理想度”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉故事讲述中内容关联与叙事连贯的平衡问题，提升生成故事的质量和效率。

Method: 采用vision-to-language模型生成图片描述，再通过语言到语言的方法将描述转化为连贯的故事，同时引入“理想度”指标评估类似人类的表现。

Result: 该方法在多项评估中表现良好，提升故事质量，训练更快，具备可复制性，还能通过“理想度”衡量人类相似度。

Conclusion: 融合图像描述与故事生成的统一框架有效改善视觉故事讲述，并通过新指标增强效果评估的多样性和贴近人类标准的能力。

Abstract: Visual Storytelling is a challenging multimodal task between Vision &
Language, where the purpose is to generate a story for a stream of images. Its
difficulty lies on the fact that the story should be both grounded to the image
sequence but also narrative and coherent. The aim of this work is to balance
between these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image
Captioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant
studies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for
obtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are
transformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our
multifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling
under a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced
stories. In addition, compared to numerous previous studies, this approach
accelerates training time and makes our framework readily reusable and
reproducible by anyone interested. Lastly, we propose a new metric/tool, named
ideality, that can be used to simulate how far some results are from an oracle
model, and we apply it to emulate human-likeness in visual storytelling.

Abstract: We introduce the first taxonomy-guided evaluation of Swahili NLP, addressing
gaps in sociolinguistic diversity. Drawing on health-related psychometric
tasks, we collect a dataset of 2,170 free-text responses from Kenyan speakers.
The data exhibits tribal influences, urban vernacular, code-mixing, and
loanwords. We develop a structured taxonomy and use it as a lens for examining
model prediction errors across pre-trained and instruction-tuned language
models. Our findings advance culturally grounded evaluation frameworks and
highlight the role of sociolinguistic variation in shaping model performance.

Result: Not available

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: Based on comparable English-Chinese news corpora annotated by Large Language
Model (LLM), this paper attempts to explore the differences in constituent
order of English-Chinese news from the perspective of functional chunks with
adverbial roles, and analyze their typical positional preferences and
distribution patterns. It is found that: (1) English news prefers linear
narrative of core information first, and functional chunks are mostly
post-positioned, while Chinese news prefers overall presentation mode of
background first, and functional chunks are often pre-positioned; (2) In SVO
structure, both English and Chinese news show differences in the distribution
of functional chunks, but the tendency of Chinese pre-positioning is more
significant, while that of English post-positioning is relatively mild; (3)
When function blocks are co-occurring, both English and Chinese news show high
flexibility, and the order adjustment is driven by information and pragmatic
purposes. The study reveals that word order has both systematic preference and
dynamic adaptability, providing new empirical support for contrastive study of
English-Chinese information structure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于模型生成的SQL缺乏可靠性评估，本研究旨在探索有效的置信度估计策略，提高模型输出的可信度。

Method: 本文比较了黑盒和白盒两种置信度估计策略，采用一致性和SQL语法感知方法，并结合执行基础的信号进行综合评估。

Result: 一致性方法在黑盒场景中表现更优，SQL语法感知在白盒场景中优势明显；引入执行基础信号进一步提升了估计效果。

Conclusion: 多策略结合能有效提升文本转SQL的置信度估计，为实际应用提供更可靠的模型输出评估手段。

Abstract: Confidence estimation for text-to-SQL aims to assess the reliability of
model-generated SQL queries without having access to gold answers. We study
this problem in the context of large language models (LLMs), where access to
model weights and gradients is often constrained. We explore both black-box and
white-box confidence estimation strategies, evaluating their effectiveness on
cross-domain text-to-SQL benchmarks. Our evaluation highlights the superior
performance of consistency-based methods among black-box models and the
advantage of SQL-syntax-aware approaches for interpreting LLM logits in
white-box settings. Furthermore, we show that execution-based grounding of
queries provides a valuable supplementary signal, improving the effectiveness
of both approaches.

### [6] [Assessing and Mitigating Data Memorization Risks in Fine-Tuned Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14062)
*Badrinath Ramakrishnan,Akshaya Balaji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文实证分析了大规模语言模型在微调过程中对敏感数据的记忆风险，提出了多层次隐私保护框架，有效降低信息泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大模型在微调中存在的隐私泄露问题，确保数据安全。

Result: 微调敏感数据显著增加隐私泄露率，提出的保护措施能在极大程度上降低泄露风险，同时保持模型性能。

Conclusion: 多层次隐私保护策略有效平衡模型性能与数据隐私，为大模型安全应用提供保障。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their tendency to memorize
training data poses significant privacy risks, particularly during fine-tuning
processes. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of data
memorization in fine-tuned LLMs and introduces a novel multi-layered privacy
protection framework. Through controlled experiments on modern LLM
architectures including GPT-2, Phi-3, and Gemma-2, we demonstrate that
fine-tuning with repeated sensitive data increases privacy leakage rates from
baseline levels of 0-5% to 60-75%, representing a 64.2% average increase across
tested models. We propose and rigorously evaluate four complementary privacy
protection methods: semantic data deduplication, differential privacy during
generation, entropy-based filtering, and pattern-based content filtering. Our
experimental results show that these techniques can reduce data leakage to 0%
while maintaining 94.7% of original model utility.

### [7] [Punctuation and Predicates in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14067)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨大型语言模型中信息的收集与传播机制，重点分析了标点符号在不同模型中的作用、不同输入组件的处理方式，以及不同推理规则的处理差异，揭示了模型的内在机制及其对可解释性的影响。

Motivation: 理解大型语言模型内部信息处理方式，特别是标点符号和推理规则的作用，提升模型解释性和性能。

Method: 采用干预技术和层交换实验，分析标点符号的重要性、不同输入组成部分的处理策略以及推理规则的差异。

Result: 不同模型中标点符号的重要性差异明显，部分模型依赖标点实现信息提取，不同输入组件和推理规则在各层表现出不同的处理方式。

Conclusion: 模型在信息处理上存在模型特异性，标点和推理规则的处理方式影响模型理解和推理能力，为模型解释性提供新见解。

Abstract: In this paper we explore where information is collected and how it is
propagated throughout layers in large language models (LLMs). We begin by
examining the surprising computational importance of punctuation tokens which
previous work has identified as attention sinks and memory aids. Using
intervention-based techniques, we evaluate the necessity and sufficiency (for
preserving model performance) of punctuation tokens across layers in GPT-2,
DeepSeek, and Gemma. Our results show stark model-specific differences: for
GPT-2, punctuation is both necessary and sufficient in multiple layers, while
this holds far less in DeepSeek and not at all in Gemma. Extending beyond
punctuation, we ask whether LLMs process different components of input (e.g.,
subjects, adjectives, punctuation, full sentences) by forming early static
summaries reused across the network, or if the model remains sensitive to
changes in these components across layers. Extending beyond punctuation, we
investigate whether different reasoning rules are processed differently by
LLMs. In particular, through interchange intervention and layer-swapping
experiments, we find that conditional statements (if, then), and universal
quantification (for all) are processed very differently. Our findings offer new
insight into the internal mechanisms of punctuation usage and reasoning in LLMs
and have implications for interpretability.

### [8] [DLLMQuant: Quantizing Diffusion-based Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14090)
*Chen Xu,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对扩散式大规模语言模型（DLLMs）的PTQ框架DLLMQuant，有效缓解量化带来的性能下降，提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决DLLMs在实用中受到模型大和计算成本高的限制，探讨量化对其性能的影响及改进方法。

Method: 开发了三种新技术：TMAS、IA-AQ和CGQ，分别应对分布变化、交互信息和权重量化问题，并结合这些技术设计DLLMQuant。

Result: 实验验证DLLMQuant显著提升DLLMs的性能和效率，减缓量化带来的性能损失。

Conclusion: DLLMQuant为DLLMs的量化提供了一种有效方案，有助推动其更广泛应用。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (DLLMs) have shown promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, but their deployment is constrained by
large model sizes and heavy computational costs. Post-training quantization
(PTQ), a widely used method for compressing and accelerating Large Language
Models (LLMs), suffers from severe accuracy degradation and reduced
generalization performance when directly applied to DLLMs (e.g., AWQ suffers a
16% accuracy drop on LLADA under W4A4). This paper explores how DLLMs' key
mechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention -
clash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation
and dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding
steps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods;
2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during
iteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps
progress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic,
making overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To
address these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs,
which incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling
(TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with
the capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware
Activation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's
interaction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3)
Certainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token
scores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight
quantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves
significant performance gains while enhancing efficiency.

### [9] [MMReview: A Multidisciplinary and Multimodal Benchmark for LLM-Based Peer Review Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14146)
*Xian Gao,Jiacheng Ruan,Zongyun Zhang,Jingsheng Gao,Ting Liu,Yuzhuo Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MMReview，涵盖多学科多模态评审任务，用于评估大量语言模型的评审能力，推动自动化同行评审发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着学术出版快速增长，同行评审成为繁重任务，亟需自动化辅助工具，现有模型缺乏统一评估标准。

Method: 设计涵盖多学科多模态内容的评审基准MMReview，包括17个领域240篇论文，设置13个任务以评估模型的评审生成、结果制定、偏好对齐以及鲁棒性。

Result: 在多款开源和闭源模型上进行广泛测试，验证了基准的全面性和有效性。

Conclusion: MMReview为自动化同行评审系统提供了标准化评估平台，促进相关技术发展。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of academic publications, peer review has become an
essential yet time-consuming responsibility within the research community.
Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been adopted to assist in the
generation of review comments; however, current LLM-based review tasks lack a
unified evaluation benchmark to rigorously assess the models' ability to
produce comprehensive, accurate, and human-aligned assessments, particularly in
scenarios involving multimodal content such as figures and tables. To address
this gap, we propose \textbf{MMReview}, a comprehensive benchmark that spans
multiple disciplines and modalities. MMReview includes multimodal content and
expert-written review comments for 240 papers across 17 research domains within
four major academic disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Sciences,
Engineering Sciences, and Social Sciences. We design a total of 13 tasks
grouped into four core categories, aimed at evaluating the performance of LLMs
and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in step-wise review generation, outcome
formulation, alignment with human preferences, and robustness to adversarial
input manipulation. Extensive experiments conducted on 16 open-source models
and 5 advanced closed-source models demonstrate the thoroughness of the
benchmark. We envision MMReview as a critical step toward establishing a
standardized foundation for the development of automated peer review systems.

*Xinhua Chen,Sitao Huang,Cong Guo,Chiyue Wei,Yintao He,Jianyi Zhang,Hai "Hellen" Li,Yiran Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种名为DPad的无训练新方法，通过限制注意力范围显著提升Diffusion-based LLMs的速度，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Diffusion-based Large Language Models中预测所有未来符号带来的计算开销问题。

Method: 引入滑动窗口和距离衰减dropout策略，限制注意力范围，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DPad实现了高达61.4倍的速度提升，保持了模型的准确性。

Conclusion: DPad是一种高效且易实现的技术，显著提升长序列推理的效率，具有推广应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) parallelize text generation by
framing decoding as a denoising process, but suffer from high computational
overhead since they predict all future suffix tokens at each step while
retaining only a small fraction. We propose Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad), a
training-free method that restricts attention to a small set of nearby suffix
tokens, preserving fidelity while eliminating redundancy. DPad integrates two
strategies: (i) a sliding window, which maintains a fixed-length suffix window,
and (ii) distance-decay dropout, which deterministically removes distant suffix
tokens before attention computation. This simple design is compatible with
existing optimizations such as prefix caching and can be implemented with only
a few lines of code. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks on
LLaDA-1.5 and Dream models demonstrate that DPad delivers up to
$\mathbf{61.4\times}$ speedup over vanilla dLLMs while maintaining comparable
accuracy, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable long-sequence
inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/Crys-Chen/DPad.

### [11] [Comparing energy consumption and accuracy in text classification inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14170)
*Johannes Zschache,Tilman Hartwig*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估了各种模型架构和硬件配置下文本分类推理的能耗与准确度的权衡，发现大模型虽能提升准确率但耗能更高，并且推理时间可作为能耗的有效代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大规模语言模型在自然语言处理中的能耗问题，尤其是推理阶段的能源效率，旨在推动可持续的AI发展。

Method: 系统实证分析不同模型架构和硬件条件下的能耗与准确性，研究能耗与模型运行时间的关系。

Result: 最优性能模型同时具有较高能效。大模型耗能显著增加，且推理能耗变异大。推理时间与能耗高度相关，后者可用作能耗的预测指标。

Conclusion: 研究为追求性能与资源效率平衡提供策略建议，有助于实现可持续AI应用。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing (NLP) tasks raises concerns about energy efficiency and
sustainability. While prior research has largely focused on energy consumption
during model training, the inference phase has received comparatively less
attention. This study systematically evaluates the trade-offs between model
accuracy and energy consumption in text classification inference across various
model architectures and hardware configurations. Our empirical analysis shows
that the best-performing model in terms of accuracy can also be
energy-efficient, while larger LLMs tend to consume significantly more energy
with lower classification accuracy. We observe substantial variability in
inference energy consumption ($<$mWh to $>$kWh), influenced by model type,
model size, and hardware specifications. Additionally, we find a strong
correlation between inference energy consumption and model runtime, indicating
that execution time can serve as a practical proxy for energy usage in settings
where direct measurement is not feasible. These findings have implications for
sustainable AI development, providing actionable insights for researchers,
industry practitioners, and policymakers seeking to balance performance and
resource efficiency in NLP applications.

Abstract: As researchers increasingly adopt LLMs as writing assistants, generating
high-quality research paper introductions remains both challenging and
essential. We introduce Scientific Introduction Generation (SciIG), a task that
evaluates LLMs' ability to produce coherent introductions from titles,
abstracts, and related works. Curating new datasets from NAACL 2025 and ICLR
2025 papers, we assess five state-of-the-art models, including both open-source
(DeepSeek-v3, Gemma-3-12B, LLaMA 4-Maverick, MistralAI Small 3.1) and
closed-source GPT-4o systems, across multiple dimensions: lexical overlap,
semantic similarity, content coverage, faithfulness, consistency, citation
correctness, and narrative quality. Our comprehensive framework combines
automated metrics with LLM-as-a-judge evaluations. Results demonstrate LLaMA-4
Maverick's superior performance on most metrics, particularly in semantic
similarity and faithfulness. Moreover, three-shot prompting consistently
outperforms fewer-shot approaches. These findings provide practical insights
into developing effective research writing assistants and set realistic
expectations for LLM-assisted academic writing. To foster reproducibility and
future research, we will publicly release all code and datasets.

TL;DR: 利用稀疏自编码器脱钩概念语义以提升大规模语言模型的知识理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型中语义与句法信息混杂的问题，提高模型对概念语义的理解和解释能力

Method: 通过平均多个语言版本（英语、法语、汉语）的概念激活，利用稀疏自编码器提取，并与知识本体中的真实关系进行相关分析

Result: 概念激活的平均值更好地反映了概念间的真实关系，提示此方法可以增强内在网络状态的机制解释性

Conclusion: 脱钩概念语义的平均技术可以提高模型的语义理解和解释能力，有助于推动语言模型的可解释性研究

Abstract: Connecting LLMs with formal knowledge representation and reasoning is a
promising approach to address their shortcomings. Embeddings and sparse
autoencoders are widely used to represent textual content, but the semantics
are entangled with syntactic and language-specific information. We propose a
method that isolates concept semantics in Large Langue Models by averaging
concept activations derived via Sparse Autoencoders. We create English text
representations from OWL ontology classes, translate the English into French
and Chinese and then pass these texts as prompts to the Gemma 2B LLM. Using the
open source Gemma Scope suite of Sparse Autoencoders, we obtain concept
activations for each class and language version. We average the different
language activations to derive a conceptual average. We then correlate the
conceptual averages with a ground truth mapping between ontology classes. Our
results give a strong indication that the conceptual average aligns to the true
relationship between classes when compared with a single language by itself.
The result hints at a new technique which enables mechanistic interpretation of
internal network states with higher accuracy.

Method: 构建GRILE基准测试，包括1151道从罗马尼亚高考中提取的选择题，评估模型答题和解释能力，分析错误类型。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro模型在准确率达83%，但大多数开源模型低于65%，部分解释存在事实和教育瑕疵，系统性弱点在形态学和 orthographic norms上。

Abstract: LLMs (Large language models) have revolutionized NLP (Natural Language
Processing), yet their pedagogical value for low-resource languages remains
unclear. We present GRILE (Grammar Romanian Inference and Language
Explanations) , the first open benchmark of 1,151 multiple-choice questions
harvested from Romanian high-stakes exams (National Evaluation, Baccalaureate,
university admissions). GRILE enables us to probe two complementary abilities
of seven state-of-the-art multilingual and Romanian-specific LLMs: (i)
selecting the correct answer, and (ii) producing linguistically accurate
explanations. While Gemini 2.5 Pro reaches 83% accuracy, most open-weight
models stay below 65%, and 48% of their explanations contain factual or
pedagogical flaws according to expert review. A detailed error analysis
pinpoints systematic weaknesses in morphology and in applying the latest DOOM3
orthographic norms. All data, code and a public web demo are released to
catalyze future research. Our findings expose open challenges for trustworthy
educational NLP in low-resource settings and establish GRILE as a new test-bed
for controllable explanation generation and evaluation.

Result: 在四个科学领域的实验证明，SurveyGen-I优于现有方法，在内容质量、一致性和引用全面性方面取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过创新的检索和记忆机制，实现了自动化综述的高质量生成，有助于推动科学文献的快速总结和传播。

Abstract: Survey papers play a critical role in scientific communication by
consolidating progress across a field. Recent advances in Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer a promising solution by automating key steps in the
survey-generation pipeline, such as retrieval, structuring, and summarization.
However, existing LLM-based approaches often struggle with maintaining
coherence across long, multi-section surveys and providing comprehensive
citation coverage. To address these limitations, we introduce SurveyGen-I, an
automatic survey generation framework that combines coarse-to-fine retrieval,
adaptive planning, and memory-guided generation. SurveyGen-I first performs
survey-level retrieval to construct the initial outline and writing plan, and
then dynamically refines both during generation through a memory mechanism that
stores previously written content and terminology, ensuring coherence across
subsections. When the system detects insufficient context, it triggers
fine-grained subsection-level retrieval. During generation, SurveyGen-I
leverages this memory mechanism to maintain coherence across subsections.
Experiments across four scientific domains demonstrate that SurveyGen-I
consistently outperforms previous works in content quality, consistency, and
citation coverage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统子词方法在形态丰富语言中表现欠佳，需改进以更好结合语言结构信息。

Method: 结合语音归一化、词根词缀字典和新算法，平衡词素保存与词汇效率，加入特殊标记，并融入BPE实现OOV覆盖。

Conclusion: 该方法语言无关，适应性强，有助于实现更具表现力和可解释性的多语言NLP系统。

Abstract: Tokenization plays a pivotal role in natural language processing (NLP),
shaping how text is segmented and interpreted by language models. While subword
methods such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece have been effective,
they often struggle with morphologically rich and agglutinative languages
because they rely on frequency rather than linguistic structure. We introduce a
hybrid tokenization framework that combines rule-based morphological analysis
with statistical subword segmentation. The method uses phonological
normalization, root-affix dictionaries, and a novel algorithm that balances
morpheme preservation with vocabulary efficiency. It assigns shared identifiers
to phonologically variant affixes (e.g., -ler and -lar) and altered root forms
(e.g., kitap vs. kitab{\i}), reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic
integrity. Special tokens are added for whitespace and case, including an
UPPERCASE marker to avoid vocabulary inflation from capitalization. BPE is
integrated for out-of-vocabulary coverage without harming morphological
coherence. On the TR-MMLU benchmark, the tokenizer achieves the highest Turkish
Token Percentage (90.29\%) and Pure Token Percentage (85.8\%). Comparisons with
tokenizers from LLaMA, Gemma, and GPT show more linguistically meaningful and
coherent tokens. Although demonstrated on Turkish, the approach is
language-independent and adaptable to other languages, offering a practical
path toward more interpretable and effective multilingual NLP systems.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在生成内容时容易出现的幻觉问题，提升其输出的真实性与可靠性。

Method: 引入跨模型一致性检测策略，通过比较不同模型针对相同提示的响应揭示细粒度的不准确性，并采用针对性修正技术校正问题部分。

Result: 在FELM和GPQA-diamond数据集上，Finch-Zk显著提升幻觉检测的F1分数和答案的准确率，证明其在实际部署中的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: Finch-Zk提供了一种切实可行的无外部知识源、基于模型的对抗幻觉的解决方案，适用于实际生产环境中增强LLM的事实可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
diverse tasks, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations--generating
content that appears plausible but contains factual inaccuracies. We present
Finch-Zk, a black-box framework that leverages FINe-grained Cross-model
consistency to detect and mitigate Hallucinations in LLM outputs without
requiring external knowledge sources. Finch-Zk introduces two key innovations:
1) a cross-model consistency checking strategy that reveals fine-grained
inaccuracies by comparing responses generated by diverse models from
semantically-equivalent prompts, and 2) a targeted mitigation technique that
applies precise corrections to problematic segments while preserving accurate
content. Experiments on the FELM dataset show Finch-Zk improves hallucination
detection F1 scores by 6-39\% compared to existing approaches. For mitigation,
Finch-Zk achieves 7-8 absolute percentage points improvement in answer accuracy
on the GPQA-diamond dataset when applied to state-of-the-art models like Llama
4 Maverick and Claude 4 Sonnet. Extensive evaluation across multiple models
demonstrates that Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready safeguard for
enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems.

Result: 显著减少错误调用，同时保持任务性能，提升效率和降低成本。

Conclusion: 行为对齐的检索策略有效提升工具增强大模型的调用准确性和成本效益。

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverage external functions to
extend their capabilities, but inaccurate function calls can lead to
inefficiencies and increased costs.Existing methods address this challenge by
fine-tuning LLMs or using demonstration-based prompting, yet they often suffer
from high training overhead and fail to account for inconsistent demonstration
samples, which misguide the model's invocation behavior. In this paper, we
trained a behavior-aligned retriever (BAR), which provides behaviorally
consistent demonstrations to help LLMs make more accurate tool-using decisions.
To train the BAR, we construct a corpus including different function-calling
behaviors, i.e., calling or non-calling.We use the contrastive learning
framework to train the BAR with customized positive/negative pairs and a
dual-negative contrastive loss, ensuring robust retrieval of behaviorally
consistent examples.Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces erroneous function calls while maintaining high task performance,
offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for tool-augmented LLMs.

Motivation: 弥补当前大语言模型在教育应用中对学生认知水平匹配评估不足的空白，特别是在中文教育中。

Method: 设计ZPD-SCA基准并由顶尖教师进行标注，测试多种大模型的零样本和示例引导性能，分析模型偏差和多样性表现。

Result: 模型在零样本中表现不佳，示范引导显著提升，但仍存在系统偏差和类别差异，凸显模型评估能力的潜力和局限。

Conclusion: ZPD-SCA有助于推动LLMs在认知评估中的研究，促进其在教育中的合理应用，需关注模型偏差和任务复杂性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in educational
applications, yet their capacity to accurately assess the cognitive alignment
of reading materials with students' developmental stages remains insufficiently
explored. This gap is particularly critical given the foundational educational
principle of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which emphasizes the need
to match learning resources with Students' Cognitive Abilities (SCA). Despite
the importance of this alignment, there is a notable absence of comprehensive
studies investigating LLMs' ability to evaluate reading comprehension
difficulty across different student age groups, especially in the context of
Chinese language education. To fill this gap, we introduce ZPD-SCA, a novel
benchmark specifically designed to assess stage-level Chinese reading
comprehension difficulty. The benchmark is annotated by 60 Special Grade
teachers, a group that represents the top 0.15% of all in-service teachers
nationwide. Experimental results reveal that LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot
learning scenarios, with Qwen-max and GLM even falling below the probability of
random guessing. When provided with in-context examples, LLMs performance
improves substantially, with some models achieving nearly double the accuracy
of their zero-shot baselines. These results reveal that LLMs possess emerging
abilities to assess reading difficulty, while also exposing limitations in
their current training for educationally aligned judgment. Notably, even the
best-performing models display systematic directional biases, suggesting
difficulties in accurately aligning material difficulty with SCA. Furthermore,
significant variations in model performance across different genres underscore
the complexity of task. We envision that ZPD-SCA can provide a foundation for
evaluating and improving LLMs in cognitively aligned educational applications.

Motivation: 确保大语言模型的置信度与其实际正确性一致是关键，现有方法存在需要额外监督或参数更新的问题。

Result: 在多个模型和配置下，实验显示该方法在校准指标上具有持续改善效果。

Conclusion: 游戏式prompt策略是一种有效的LLM校准新途径。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in
decision-critical domains, it becomes essential to ensure that their confidence
estimates faithfully correspond to their actual correctness. Existing
calibration methods have primarily focused on post-hoc adjustments or auxiliary
model training; however, many of these approaches necessitate additional
supervision or parameter updates. In this work, we propose a novel prompt-based
calibration framework inspired by the Credence Calibration Game. Our method
establishes a structured interaction loop wherein LLMs receive feedback based
on the alignment of their predicted confidence with correctness. Through
feedback-driven prompting and natural language summaries of prior performance,
our framework dynamically improves model calibration. Extensive experiments
across models and game configurations demonstrate consistent improvements in
evaluation metrics. Our results highlight the potential of game-based prompting
as an effective strategy for LLM calibration. Code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在关系抽取中存在的虚假关联和不可靠的问题，提升知识图谱的质量与 downstream 任务的准确性。

Method: DEPTH结合依存句法句子简化和两层次的关系预测修正，采用因果奖励模型进行强化学习微调。

Result: 大幅降低虚假关系率（至7.0%），F1分数比现有方法提升17.2%。

Conclusion: DEPTH通过多层次、依存语法引导和强化学习，有效提升关系抽取的准确性，减少虚假关系，增强知识图谱的可靠性。

Abstract: Relation extraction enables the construction of structured knowledge for many
downstream applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown great
promise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation
classification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related
entity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine
whether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence
structures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such
hallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the
integrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these
challenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware
sEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the
relation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,
DEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for
each pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence
into a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise
while preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local
predictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,
correcting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a
causality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling
spurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning
with human feedback. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DEPTH
reduces the average hallucination rate to 7.0\% while achieving a 17.2\%
improvement in average F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 通过引入Cognitive Surgery框架，有效激发LLMs的隐性自我识别潜能，改善其在单一文本环境下的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to possess a degree of
self-recognition capability-the ability to identify whether a given text was
generated by themselves. Prior work has demonstrated that this capability is
reliably expressed under the Pair Presentation Paradigm (PPP), where the model
is presented with two texts and asked to choose which one it authored. However,
performance deteriorates sharply under the Individual Presentation Paradigm
(IPP), where the model is given a single text to judge authorship. Although
this phenomenon has been observed, its underlying causes have not been
systematically analyzed. In this paper, we first replicate existing findings to
confirm that LLMs struggle to distinguish self- from other-generated text under
IPP. We then investigate the reasons for this failure and attribute it to a
phenomenon we term Implicit Territorial Awareness (ITA)-the model's latent
ability to distinguish self- and other-texts in representational space, which
remains unexpressed in its output behavior. To awaken the ITA of LLMs, we
propose Cognitive Surgery (CoSur), a novel framework comprising four main
modules: representation extraction, territory construction, authorship
discrimination and cognitive editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method improves the performance of three different LLMs in the IPP
scenario, achieving average accuracies of 83.25%, 66.19%, and 88.01%,
respectively.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problems of missing reasoning chains and
insufficient entity-level semantic understanding in large language models when
dealing with tasks that require structured knowledge. It proposes a fine-tuning
algorithm framework based on knowledge graph injection. The method builds on
pretrained language models and introduces structured graph information for
auxiliary learning. A graph neural network is used to encode entities and their
relations, constructing a graph-based semantic representation. A fusion
mechanism is then designed to jointly model the knowledge graph embeddings with
the contextual representations from the language model. To enhance the
robustness of knowledge integration, a gating mechanism is introduced to
dynamically balance the contributions of linguistic semantics and structural
knowledge. This effectively mitigates conflicts between different
representational spaces. During training, a joint loss function is constructed
to account for both task performance and structural alignment objectives. This
helps improve the accuracy of entity prediction and semantic reasoning. The
study also includes a series of systematic sensitivity experiments. It
evaluates the effects of learning rate, graph coverage, and structural
perturbations on model performance. The results further validate the
effectiveness and stability of the proposed method across tasks such as entity
recognition, question answering, and language generation. Experimental findings
show that the proposed structure-aware fine-tuning framework significantly
enhances the model's ability to represent complex semantic units. It
demonstrates better semantic consistency and contextual logic modeling in
scenarios involving structural reasoning and entity extraction.

Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the

Abstract: Convincing someone of the truth value of a premise requires understanding and
articulating the core logical structure of the argument which proves or
disproves the premise. Understanding the logical structure of an argument
refers to understanding the underlying "reasons" which make up the proof or
disproof of the premise - as a function of the "logical atoms" in the argument.
While it has been shown that transformers can "chain" rules to derive simple
arguments, the challenge of articulating the "reasons" remains. Not only do
current approaches to chaining rules suffer in terms of their interpretability,
they are also quite constrained in their ability to accommodate extensions to
theoretically equivalent reasoning tasks - a model trained to chain rules
cannot support abduction or identify contradictions. In this work we suggest
addressing these shortcomings by identifying an intermediate representation
(which we call the Representation of the Logical Structure (RLS) of the
argument) that possesses an understanding of the logical structure of a natural
language argument - the logical atoms in the argument and the rules
incorporating them. Given the logical structure, reasoning is deterministic and
easy to compute. Therefore, our approach supports all forms of reasoning that
depend on the logical structure of the natural language argument, including
arbitrary depths of reasoning, on-the-fly mistake rectification and interactive
discussion with respect to an argument. We show that we can identify and
extract the logical structure of natural language arguments in three popular
reasoning datasets with high accuracies, thus supporting explanation generation
and extending the reasoning capabilities significantly.

Abstract: While multiple emotional speech corpora exist for commonly spoken languages,
there is a lack of functional datasets for smaller (spoken) languages, such as

the only other database of Danish emotional speech. We present EmoTale; a
corpus comprising Danish and English speech recordings with their associated
enacted emotion annotations. We demonstrate the validity of the dataset by
investigating and presenting its predictive power using speech emotion
recognition (SER) models. We develop SER models for EmoTale and the reference
datasets using self-supervised speech model (SSLM) embeddings and the openSMILE
feature extractor. We find the embeddings superior to the hand-crafted
features. The best model achieves an unweighted average recall (UAR) of 64.1%
on the EmoTale corpus using leave-one-speaker-out cross-validation, comparable

Abstract: One of the main challenges in neural sign language production (SLP) lies in
the high intra-class variability of signs, arising from signer morphology and
stylistic variety in the training data. To improve robustness to such
variations, we propose two enhancements to the standard Progressive
Transformers (PT) architecture (Saunders et al., 2020). First, we encode poses
using bone rotations in quaternion space and train with a geodesic loss to
improve the accuracy and clarity of angular joint movements. Second, we
introduce a contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings by semantic
similarity, using either gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity,
aiming to filter out anatomical and stylistic features that do not convey
relevant semantic information. On the Phoenix14T dataset, the contrastive loss
alone yields a 16% improvement in Probability of Correct Keypoint over the PT
baseline. When combined with quaternion-based pose encoding, the model achieves
a 6% reduction in Mean Bone Angle Error. These results point to the benefit of
incorporating skeletal structure modeling and semantically guided contrastive
objectives on sign pose representations into the training of Transformer-based
SLP models.

Abstract: Southern Uzbek (uzs) is a Turkic language variety spoken by around 5 million
people in Afghanistan and differs significantly from Northern Uzbek (uzn) in
phonology, lexicon, and orthography. Despite the large number of speakers,
Southern Uzbek is underrepresented in natural language processing. We present

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis is widely used to quantify sentiment in text, but its
application to literary texts poses unique challenges due to figurative
language, stylistic ambiguity, as well as sentiment evocation strategies.
Traditional dictionary-based tools often underperform, especially for
low-resource languages, and transformer models, while promising, typically
output coarse categorical labels that limit fine-grained analysis. We introduce
a novel continuous sentiment scoring method based on concept vector projection,
trained on multilingual literary data, which more effectively captures nuanced
sentiment expressions across genres, languages, and historical periods. Our
approach outperforms existing tools on English and Danish texts, producing
sentiment scores whose distribution closely matches human ratings, enabling
more accurate analysis and sentiment arc modeling in literature.

Result: SSA显著改善了目标任务的表现，适用于不同类型的变换器模型，在多项语言任务中优于传统Softmax。

Conclusion: 软最大化限制了模型推理能力，采用SSA可以有效缓解这一问题，提升模型推理性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a remarkable capacity to learn by
analogy, known as in-context learning (ICL). However, recent studies have
revealed limitations in this ability. In this paper, we examine these
limitations on tasks involving first-order quantifiers such as {\em all} and
{\em some}, as well as on ICL with linear functions. We identify Softmax, the
scoring function in attention mechanism, as a contributing factor to these
constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{scaled signed averaging
(SSA)}, a novel alternative to Softmax. Empirical results show that SSA
dramatically improves performance on our target tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate
both encoder-only and decoder-only transformers models with SSA, demonstrating
that they match or exceed their Softmax-based counterparts across a variety of
linguistic probing tasks.

Conclusion: ShizhenGPT突破中医多模态挑战，为未来中医诊断智能化提供新可能。

Abstract: Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in various domains, their
potential in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains largely underexplored
due to two critical barriers: (1) the scarcity of high-quality TCM data and (2)
the inherently multimodal nature of TCM diagnostics, which involve looking,
listening, smelling, and pulse-taking. These sensory-rich modalities are beyond
the scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present
ShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data
scarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text
and 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and
physiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to
achieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect
recent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for
Medicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that
ShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger
proprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among
existing multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities
like sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal
perception and diagnosis in TCM. Datasets, models, and code are publicly
available. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in this field.

Abstract: We established a rigorous benchmark for text-based recipe generation, a
fundamental task in natural language generation. We present a comprehensive
comparative study contrasting a fine-tuned GPT-2 large (774M) model against the
GPT-2 small (124M) model and traditional LSTM/RNN baselines on the 5-cuisine
corpus from RecipeDB. Our key contribution is a targeted tokenization strategy
that augments the vocabulary with 23 common fraction tokens and custom
structural markers. This approach addresses a critical limitation of generic
tokenizers by preserving essential recipe structures and precise numerical
quantities, thereby enhancing domain specificity. Performance is evaluated
using a comprehensive suite of seven automatic metrics spanning fluency
(BLEU-4, METEOR), coherence (ROUGE-L), semantic relevance (BERTScore), and
diversity. Our experiments show that the large transformer-based approach
yields a >20% relative improvement in BERTScore (F1) (0.92 vs 0.72) over the
best recurrent baseline, while reducing perplexity by 69.8%. We conclude with a
discussion of remaining challenges, particularly regarding factual accuracy,
and outline how this foundational study paves the way for integrating
real-world constraints and multi-modal inputs in advanced recipe generation
research.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a critical technique in deep learning. Traditional
methods like Back-translation typically focus on lexical-level rephrasing,
which primarily produces variations with the same semantics. While large
language models (LLMs) have enhanced text augmentation by their "knowledge
emergence" capability, controlling the style and structure of these outputs
remains challenging and requires meticulous prompt engineering. In this paper,
we propose LMTransplant, a novel text augmentation paradigm leveraging LLMs.
The core idea of LMTransplant is transplant-then-regenerate: incorporating seed
text into a context expanded by LLM, and asking the LLM to regenerate a variant
based on the expanded context. This strategy allows the model to create more
diverse and creative content-level variants by fully leveraging the knowledge
embedded in LLMs, while preserving the core attributes of the original text. We
evaluate LMTransplant across various text-related tasks, demonstrating its
superior performance over existing text augmentation methods. Moreover,
LMTransplant demonstrates exceptional scalability as the size of augmented data
grows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in multilingual
contexts, yet their capacity for consistent, logically grounded alignment
across languages remains underexplored. We present a controlled evaluation
framework for multilingual natural language inference (NLI) that generates
synthetic, logic-based premise-hypothesis pairs and translates them into a
typologically diverse set of languages. This design enables precise control
over semantic relations and allows testing in both monolingual and
mixed-language (code-switched) conditions. Surprisingly, code-switching does
not degrade, and can even improve, performance, suggesting that
translation-induced lexical variation may serve as a regularization signal. We
validate semantic preservation through embedding-based similarity analyses and
cross-lingual alignment visualizations, confirming the fidelity of translated
pairs. Our findings expose both the potential and the brittleness of current
LLM cross-lingual reasoning, and identify code-switching as a promising lever
for improving multilingual robustness. Code available at:

Abstract: Urban transportation systems encounter diverse challenges across multiple
tasks, such as traffic forecasting, electric vehicle (EV) charging demand
prediction, and taxi dispatch. Existing approaches suffer from two key
limitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and
data-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while
large language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural
language interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical
reasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose
TransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal
modeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our
approach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex
dependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph
attention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured
embeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via
reinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input
characteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework
operates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations,
dynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and
projecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to
generate task-specific predictions. Experiments across seven datasets and three
tasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised
and zero-shot settings. Compared to ten baseline models, it delivers
competitive performance on both regression and planning problems, showing
strong generalization and cross-task adaptability. Our code is available at

Motivation: 电子健康记录冗长且噪声多，挑战病历信息提取与理解。大语言模型（LLMs）虽有潜力，但受限于长文本的处理能力。

Result: RAG在性能上接近或优于仅使用最新病历，同时大幅减轻输入负担。

Conclusion: RAG作为一种高效且具有竞争力的方法，有望在未来更长文本处理能力增强时保持优势。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are long, noisy, and often redundant, posing
a major challenge for the clinicians who must navigate them. Large language
models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for extracting and reasoning over this
unstructured text, but the length of clinical notes often exceeds even
state-of-the-art models' extended context windows. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) offers an alternative by retrieving task-relevant passages
from across the entire EHR, potentially reducing the amount of required input
tokens. In this work, we propose three clinical tasks designed to be replicable
across health systems with minimal effort: 1) extracting imaging procedures, 2)
generating timelines of antibiotic use, and 3) identifying key diagnoses. Using
EHRs from actual hospitalized patients, we test three state-of-the-art LLMs
with varying amounts of provided context, using either targeted text retrieval
or the most recent clinical notes. We find that RAG closely matches or exceeds
the performance of using recent notes, and approaches the performance of using
the models' full context while requiring drastically fewer input tokens. Our
results suggest that RAG remains a competitive and efficient approach even as
newer models become capable of handling increasingly longer amounts of text.

Abstract: Scaling inference through long chains-of-thought (CoTs) has unlocked
impressive reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), yet the
reasoning process remains almost exclusively English-centric. We construct
translated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen
2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT
generation across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments
reveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot
language varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves
performance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and
proves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning
remain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but
does not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune
using only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\% in Swahili. Third,
data quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully
curated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier
corpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results
clarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated
datasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research.

Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown
impressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research
systems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking
and synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown
impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain
challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited
accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model
lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the
framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored
for medical contexts.We present a medical deep research agent that addresses
these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data
synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest
chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex
multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private
medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate
medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse
trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool
interactions.Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised
fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our
MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing
new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining
competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates
that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and
training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform
much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a
promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language
generation tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding
strategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains
challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands.
While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted
technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing
diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of
activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that
dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit
quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority
of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model
variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width,
quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this
multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization
behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide
a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and
experimental setups will be released to support the community.

Conclusion: 该基准为金融领域复杂任务中的LLM检索行为研究奠定基础，将在公开数据集基础上扩展至更广泛范围。

Abstract: Accurate information retrieval (IR) is critical in the financial domain,
where investors must identify relevant information from large collections of
documents. Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in
retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but
also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and
domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the
model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is
most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate
such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce
FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with
multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The
benchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&P-100 listed firms
and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document
type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected
document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning
steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a
quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance.
We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how
targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance.
Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior
in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance. We will release the dataset
publicly upon acceptance of the paper and plan to expand and share dataset for
the full S&P 500 and beyond.

Abstract: The explosive growth of the video game industry has created an urgent need
for recommendation systems that can scale with expanding catalogs and maintain
user engagement. While prior work has explored accuracy and diversity in
recommendations, existing models underutilize playtime, a rich behavioral
signal unique to gaming platforms, and overlook the potential of multimodal
information to enhance diversity. In this paper, we propose DP2Rec, a novel
Dual-Phase Playtime-guided Recommendation model designed to jointly optimize
accuracy and diversity. First, we introduce a playtime-guided interest
intensity exploration module that separates strong and weak preferences via
dual-beta modeling, enabling fine-grained user profiling and more accurate
recommendations. Second, we present a playtime-guided multimodal random walks
module that simulates player exploration using transitions guided by both
playtime-derived interest similarity and multimodal semantic similarity. This
mechanism preserves core preferences while promoting cross-category discovery
through latent semantic associations and adaptive category balancing. Extensive
experiments on a real-world game dataset show that DP2Rec outperforms existing
methods in both recommendation accuracy and diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统压缩方法如gzip难以压缩结构性但语义重复的域特定文件。

Method: 提出基于GPT-2的预处理管道，将域特定文件转化为更适合压缩的格式，然后用gzip压缩。

Result: 在日志和HTML文件上分别提升0.34%和5.8%的压缩效率。

Conclusion: GPT预处理能有效增强传统压缩算法对域特定结构文件的压缩能力。

Abstract: In the modern era, large volumes of data are being produced continuously,
especially in domain-specific fields such as medical records and clinical
files, defence logs and HTML-based web traffic. Data with such volume and
complexity needs to be compressed before storing and transmitting efficiently.
Data compression has gained significant attention from modern researchers,
resulting in the development of fast and efficient compression algorithms such
as Gzip. However, since gzip works on the principle of repetition of binary
patterns, one of the limitations of gzip is that domain-specific formats like
JSON, XML, HTML, and log files, while structured, may have semantic repetition
but not syntactic repetition, which gzip finds difficult to compress. In this
article, we propose a GPT-based preprocessor for such domain-specific files. We
propose a pipeline made up of GPT-2 taking domain-specific files as input,
which pattern-based compressors like gzip find difficult to work on. The
preprocessor results are output in a file that is designed for compressors like
gzip. After preprocessing, the gzip works on the other end of the pipeline and
compresses the data as usual. We used different types of both real-world and
synthetically generated data, such as logs and HTML files, for the experiment
of the proposed model. We found promising results and an improvement of the
Defence logs by 0.34 per cent and HTML files by 5.8 per cent.

Result: 多智能体系统大幅提高模型准确率，解决模型性能不均问题，验证于多项数据集。

Conclusion: 结构化多智能体方法能显著增强AI在复杂医学推理中的表现，为临床医学AI辅助提供新途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical domains, but their
ability to handle specialized neurological reasoning requires systematic
evaluation. We developed a comprehensive benchmark using 305 questions from
Israeli Board Certification Exams in Neurology, classified along three
complexity dimensions: factual knowledge depth, clinical concept integration,
and reasoning complexity. We evaluated ten LLMs using base models,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a novel multi-agent system. Results
showed significant performance variation. OpenAI-o1 achieved the highest base
performance (90.9% accuracy), while specialized medical models performed poorly
(52.9% for Meditron-70B). RAG provided modest benefits but limited
effectiveness on complex reasoning questions. In contrast, our multi-agent
framework, decomposing neurological reasoning into specialized cognitive
functions including question analysis, knowledge retrieval, answer synthesis,
and validation, achieved dramatic improvements, especially for mid-range
models. The LLaMA 3.3-70B-based agentic system reached 89.2% accuracy versus
69.5% for its base model, with substantial gains on level 3 complexity
questions. The multi-agent approach transformed inconsistent subspecialty
performance into uniform excellence, addressing neurological reasoning
challenges that persisted with RAG enhancement. We validated our approach using
an independent dataset of 155 neurological cases from MedQA. Results confirm
that structured multi-agent approaches designed to emulate specialized
cognitive processes significantly enhance complex medical reasoning, offering
promising directions for AI assistance in challenging clinical contexts.

Abstract: In daily fantasy sports, players enter into "contests" where they compete
against each other by building teams of athletes that score fantasy points
based on what actually occurs in a real-life sports match. For any given sports
match, there are a multitude of contests available to players, with substantial
variation across 3 main dimensions: entry fee, number of spots, and the prize
pool distribution. As player preferences are also quite heterogeneous, contest
personalization is an important tool to match players with contests. This paper
presents a scalable contest recommendation system, powered by a Wide and Deep
Interaction Ranker (WiDIR) at its core. We productionized this system at our
company, one of the large fantasy sports platforms with millions of daily
contests and millions of players, where online experiments show a marked

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a well-established and rapidly
evolving field within AI that enhances the outputs of large language models by
integrating relevant information retrieved from external knowledge sources.
While industry adoption of RAG is now beginning, there is a significant lack of
research on its practical application in industrial contexts. To address this
gap, we conducted a semistructured interview study with 13 industry
practitioners to explore the current state of RAG adoption in real-world
settings. Our study investigates how companies apply RAG in practice, providing
(1) an overview of industry use cases, (2) a consolidated list of system
requirements, (3) key challenges and lessons learned from practical
experiences, and (4) an analysis of current industry evaluation methods. Our
main findings show that current RAG applications are mostly limited to
domain-specific QA tasks, with systems still in prototype stages; industry
requirements focus primarily on data protection, security, and quality, while
issues such as ethics, bias, and scalability receive less attention; data
preprocessing remains a key challenge, and system evaluation is predominantly

Conclusion: 基于反事实奖励学习的行为建模框架有效改善排名质量，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Traditional ranking systems rely on proxy loss functions that assume
simplistic user behavior, such as users preferring a rank list where items are
sorted by hand-crafted relevance. However, real-world user interactions are
influenced by complex behavioral biases, including position bias, brand
affinity, decoy effects, and similarity aversion, which these objectives fail
to capture. As a result, models trained on such losses often misalign with
actual user utility, such as the probability of any click or purchase across
the ranked list. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for modeling
user behavior through counterfactual reward learning. Our method, RewardRank,
first trains a deep utility model to estimate user engagement for entire item
permutations using logged data. Then, a ranking policy is optimized to maximize
predicted utility via differentiable soft permutation operators, enabling
end-to-end training over the space of factual and counterfactual rankings. To
address the challenge of evaluation without ground-truth for unseen
permutations, we introduce two automated protocols: (i) $\textit{KD-Eval}$,
using a position-aware oracle for counterfactual reward estimation, and (ii)
$\textit{LLM-Eval}$, which simulates user preferences via large language
models. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks, including Baidu-ULTR and the
Amazon KDD Cup datasets, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
strong baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling user behavior
dynamics for utility-optimized ranking. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: YOLOR通过创新架构，有效解决了多阶段方法中的效果效率不一致问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Reranking plays a crucial role in modern recommender systems by capturing the
mutual influences within the list. Due to the inherent challenges of
combinatorial search spaces, most methods adopt a two-stage search paradigm: a
simple General Search Unit (GSU) efficiently reduces the candidate space, and
an Exact Search Unit (ESU) effectively selects the optimal sequence. These
methods essentially involve making trade-offs between effectiveness and
efficiency, while suffering from a severe \textbf{inconsistency problem}, that
is, the GSU often misses high-value lists from ESU. To address this problem, we
propose YOLOR, a one-stage reranking method that removes the GSU while
retaining only the ESU. Specifically, YOLOR includes: (1) a Tree-based Context
Extraction Module (TCEM) that hierarchically aggregates multi-scale contextual
features to achieve "list-level effectiveness", and (2) a Context Cache Module
(CCM) that enables efficient feature reuse across candidate permutations to
achieve "permutation-level efficiency". Extensive experiments across public and
industry datasets validate YOLOR's performance, and we have successfully
deployed YOLOR on the Meituan food delivery platform.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Not available

Method: Not available

Result: Not available

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: Implicit collaborative filtering recommenders are usually trained to learn
user positive preferences. Negative sampling, which selects informative
negative items to form negative training data, plays a crucial role in this
process. Since items are often clustered in the latent space, existing negative
sampling strategies normally oversample negative items from the dense regions.
This leads to homogeneous negative data and limited model expressiveness. In
this paper, we propose Diverse Negative Sampling (DivNS), a novel approach that
explicitly accounts for diversity in negative training data during the negative
sampling process. DivNS first finds hard negative items with large preference
scores and constructs user-specific caches that store unused but highly
informative negative samples. Then, its diversity-augmented sampler selects a
diverse subset of negative items from the cache while ensuring dissimilarity
from the user's hard negatives. Finally, a synthetic negatives generator
combines the selected diverse negatives with hard negatives to form more
effective training data. The resulting synthetic negatives are both informative
and diverse, enabling recommenders to learn a broader item space and improve
their generalisability. Extensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of DivNS in improving recommendation quality
while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: 引入分布引导的多模态兴趣自编码器，在行为层面实现多模态兴趣的交叉融合。

Result: 实验证明DMAE优于现有方法，具有更强的推荐性能。

Conclusion: DMAE通过动态行为层次上的多模态兴趣融合，有效增强推荐系统的性能，拓展了多模态推荐的研究路径。

Abstract: Traditional recommendation methods rely on correlating the embedding vectors
of item IDs to capture implicit collaborative filtering signals to model the
user's interest in the target item. Consequently, traditional ID-based methods
often encounter data sparsity problems stemming from the sparse nature of ID
features. To alleviate the problem of item ID sparsity, recommendation models
incorporate multimodal item information to enhance recommendation accuracy.
However, existing multimodal recommendation methods typically employ early
fusion approaches, which focus primarily on combining text and image features,
while neglecting the contextual influence of user behavior sequences. This
oversight prevents dynamic adaptation of multimodal interest representations
based on behavioral patterns, consequently restricting the model's capacity to
effectively capture user multimodal interests. Therefore, this paper proposes
the Distribution-Guided Multimodal-Interest Auto-Encoder (DMAE), which achieves
the cross fusion of user multimodal interest at the behavioral
level.Ultimately, extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DMAE.

Result: 实验验证GSVR显著增强了多场景推荐模型的表现，能学习更鲁棒的表示。

Conclusion: GSVR有效缓解数据稀疏，提升多场景推荐模型的适应性和精度。

Abstract: With the emergence of e-commerce, the recommendations provided by commercial
platforms must adapt to diverse scenarios to accommodate users' varying
shopping preferences. Current methods typically use a unified framework to
offer personalized recommendations for different scenarios. However, they often
employ shared bottom representations, which partially hinders the model's
capacity to capture scenario uniqueness. Ideally, users and items should
exhibit specific characteristics in different scenarios, prompting the need to
learn scenario-specific representations to differentiate scenarios. Yet,
variations in user and item interactions across scenarios lead to data sparsity
issues, impeding the acquisition of scenario-specific representations. To learn
robust scenario-specific representations, we introduce a Global-Distribution
Aware Scenario-Specific Variational Representation Learning Framework (GSVR)
that can be directly applied to existing multi-scenario methods. Specifically,
considering the uncertainty stemming from limited samples, our approach employs
a probabilistic model to generate scenario-specific distributions for each user
and item in each scenario, estimated through variational inference (VI).
Additionally, we introduce the global knowledge-aware multinomial distributions
as prior knowledge to regulate the learning of the posterior user and item
distributions, ensuring similarities among distributions for users with akin
interests and items with similar side information. This mitigates the risk of
users or items with fewer records being overwhelmed in sparse scenarios.
Extensive experimental results affirm the efficacy of GSVR in assisting
existing multi-scenario recommendation methods in learning more robust
representations.

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合生成模型优势，显著改善CTR预测表现，为推荐系统提供新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have inspired the field of recommender
systems to explore generative approaches, but most existing research focuses on
sequence generation, a paradigm ill-suited for click-through rate (CTR)
prediction. CTR models critically depend on a large number of cross-features
between the target item and the user to estimate the probability of clicking on
the item, and discarding these cross-features will significantly impair model
performance. Therefore, to harness the ability of generative models to
understand data distributions and thereby alleviate the constraints of
traditional discriminative models in label-scarce space, diverging from the
item-generation paradigm of sequence generation methods, we propose a novel
sample-level generation paradigm specifically designed for the CTR task: a
two-stage Discrete Diffusion-Based Generative CTR training framework (DGenCTR).
This two-stage framework comprises a diffusion-based generative pre-training
stage and a CTR-targeted supervised fine-tuning stage for CTR. Finally,
extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing conclusively validate the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Large-scale industrial recommendation systems typically employ a two-stage
paradigm of retrieval and ranking to handle huge amounts of information. Recent
research focuses on improving the performance of retrieval model. A promising
way is to introduce extensive information about users and items. On one hand,
lifelong sequential behavior is valuable. Existing lifelong behavior modeling
methods in ranking stage focus on the interaction of lifelong behavior and
candidate items from retrieval stage. In retrieval stage, it is difficult to
utilize lifelong behavior because of a large corpus of candidate items. On the
other hand, existing retrieval methods mostly relay on interaction information,
potentially disregarding valuable multi-modal information. To solve these
problems, we represent the pioneering exploration of leveraging multi-modal
information and lifelong sequence model within the advanced tree-based
retrieval model. We propose Multi-modal Indexing and Searching with lifelong
Sequence (MISS), which contains a multi-modal index tree and a multi-modal
lifelong sequence modeling module. Specifically, for better index structure, we
propose multi-modal index tree, which is built using the multi-modal embedding
to precisely represent item similarity. To precisely capture diverse user
interests in user lifelong sequence, we propose collaborative general search
unit (Co-GSU) and multi-modal general search unit (MM-GSU) for
multi-perspective interests searching.

Conclusion: OneLoc有效结合地理信息和多目标优化，推动本地生活服务推荐技术向前发展。

Abstract: Local life service is a vital scenario in Kuaishou App, where video
recommendation is intrinsically linked with store's location information. Thus,
recommendation in our scenario is challenging because we should take into
account user's interest and real-time location at the same time. In the face of
such complex scenarios, end-to-end generative recommendation has emerged as a
new paradigm, such as OneRec in the short video scenario, OneSug in the search
scenario, and EGA in the advertising scenario. However, in local life service,
an end-to-end generative recommendation model has not yet been developed as
there are some key challenges to be solved. The first challenge is how to make
full use of geographic information. The second challenge is how to balance
multiple objectives, including user interests, the distance between user and
stores, and some other business objectives. To address the challenges, we
propose OneLoc. Specifically, we leverage geographic information from different
perspectives: (1) geo-aware semantic ID incorporates both video and geographic
information for tokenization, (2) geo-aware self-attention in the encoder
leverages both video location similarity and user's real-time location, and (3)
neighbor-aware prompt captures rich context information surrounding users for
generation. To balance multiple objectives, we use reinforcement learning and
propose two reward functions, i.e., geographic reward and GMV reward. With the
above design, OneLoc achieves outstanding offline and online performance. In
fact, OneLoc has been deployed in local life service of Kuaishou App. It serves
400 million active users daily, achieving 21.016% and 17.891% improvements in
terms of gross merchandise value (GMV) and orders numbers.

Result: 模型在提升真正的正向推荐效果的同时，有效减少了错误推广负项的数量，优于现有的方法。

Conclusion: 引入负反馈结合创新损失设计，增强序列推荐的准确性和用户满意度。

Abstract: We consider the task of learning from both positive and negative feedback in
a sequential recommendation scenario, as both types of feedback are often
present in user interactions. Meanwhile, conventional sequential learning
models usually focus on considering and predicting positive interactions,
ignoring that reducing items with negative feedback in recommendations improves
user satisfaction with the service. Moreover, the negative feedback can
potentially provide a useful signal for more accurate identification of true
user interests. In this work, we propose to train two transformer encoders on
separate positive and negative interaction sequences. We incorporate both types
of feedback into the training objective of the sequential recommender using a
composite loss function that includes positive and negative cross-entropy as
well as a cleverly crafted contrastive term, that helps better modeling
opposing patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in terms
of increasing true-positive metrics compared to state-of-the-art sequential
recommendation methods while reducing the number of wrongly promoted negative
items.

Conclusion: LLMs能较好理解情感类别，但在情感强度方面仍存在偏差，强调了人工与生物情感认知的差异。

Abstract: Emotions exert an immense influence over human behavior and cognition in both
commonplace and high-stress tasks. Discussions of whether or how to integrate
large language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for,
or interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of
how these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's
alignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of
LLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we
elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images
that were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that
when performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human
participants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or
higher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between
human and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall
LLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear,
disgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence)
organization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than
human ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents
interpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among
biological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补单一方法在复杂决策解释中的不足，结合符号推理和自然语言理解以增强解释能力。

Method: 结合SAT求解器和LLMs，设计用于解释Hitori谜题的工具，采用短释焊和视觉说明相结合。

Result: 展现工具在帮助人类解决Hitori谜题方面的有效性，提供实验验证。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了符号推理和语言模型，为复杂决策的解释提供了新的解决思路。

Abstract: We propose a neurosymbolic approach to the explanation of complex sequences
of decisions that combines the strengths of decision procedures and Large
Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate this approach by producing explanations
for the solutions of Hitori puzzles. The rules of Hitori include local
constraints that are effectively explained by short resolution proofs. However,
they also include a connectivity constraint that is more suitable for visual
explanations. Hence, Hitori provides an excellent testing ground for a flexible
combination of SAT solvers and LLMs. We have implemented a tool that assists
humans in solving Hitori puzzles, and we present experimental evidence of its
effectiveness.

Abstract: Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making
problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily
relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in
addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations:
high benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42\%, narrow evaluation
scope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to
heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we
first enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more
comprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization
modeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems
with standardized annotations. Furthermore, we present ORThought, a novel
framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through
chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ORThought outperforms existing
approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with particularly significant
advantages on complex optimization problems. Finally, we provide a systematic
analysis of our method, identifying critical success factors and failure modes,
providing valuable insights for future research on LLM-based optimization
modeling.

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注动态认知治理、行为差异量化和元治理协议，以推动安全可信的人机合作发展。

Abstract: Advancements in AI have led to agents in networked environments increasingly
mirroring human behavior, thereby blurring the boundary between artificial and
human actors in specific contexts. This shift brings about significant
challenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, security and etc. The difficulty
in supervising of agent behaviors may lead to issues such as data contamination
and unclear accountability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes
the "Network Behavior Lifecycle" model, which divides network behavior into 6
stages and systematically analyzes the behavioral differences between humans
and agents at each stage. Based on these insights, the paper further introduces
the "Agent for Agent (A4A)" paradigm and the "Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity
(HABD)" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and
agent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency,
intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns.
The effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red
team penetration and blue team defense. Finally, the paper discusses future
research directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral
disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to
provide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and
trustworthy human-agent collaboration.

Motivation: 旨在增强自动代理的视角理解和合作能力，应对当前LLM系统在主动感知和合作推理中的局限。

Method: 利用Fast Downward规划器生成的解决方案图，构建三类示例（目标路径、信息路径、逐步决策序列），并将其转化为“思考-行动”示例，以促进LLM的推理训练。

Result: 结构化示例在一些基本任务中表现不错，但在需要隐喻、成本评估等更复杂的认知任务中效果有限，提出需要更全面的信念追踪和成本模型。

Conclusion: 单靠结构化示例难以实现稳健的视角理解，应结合更丰富的推理机制和环境设计，推动社会化合作能力的提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have
opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of
autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative
reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or
knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study
investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed
solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the
performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a
structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct
categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths
(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative
actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''
examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each
decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and
overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are
successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in
scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs
of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are
insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit
belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially
grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Geometry problems are a crucial testbed for AI reasoning capabilities. Most
existing geometry solving systems cannot express problems within a unified
framework, thus are difficult to integrate with other mathematical fields.
Besides, since most geometric proofs rely on intuitive diagrams, verifying
geometry problems is particularly challenging. To address these gaps, we
introduce LeanGeo, a unified formal system for formalizing and solving
competition-level geometry problems within the Lean 4 theorem prover. LeanGeo
features a comprehensive library of high-level geometric theorems with Lean's
foundational logic, enabling rigorous proof verification and seamless
integration with Mathlib. We also present LeanGeo-Bench, a formal geometry
benchmark in LeanGeo, comprising problems from the International Mathematical
Olympiad (IMO) and other advanced sources. Our evaluation demonstrates the
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models on this
benchmark, highlighting the need for further advancements in automated
geometric reasoning. We open source the theorem library and the benchmark of
LeanGeo at https://github.com/project-numina/LeanGeo/tree/master.

Motivation: 城市极端降雨频发带来交通阻塞和安全风险，传统决策方法无法动态应对环境变化，急需一种更智能且适应性强的解决方案。

Method: 引入基于知识引导提示、熵约束生成和反馈驱动优化的多层次多智能体框架H-J，构建闭环决策流程，从感知到策略执行不断优化。

Conclusion: 基于不确定性和知识约束的LLM策略，有望提升城市应急系统的韧性和自适应能力，有助于应对未来复杂极端天气挑战。

Abstract: In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme urban rainfall events
has posed significant challenges to emergency scheduling systems. Urban
flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,
threatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making
remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among
competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)
requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental
conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies
frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.
Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent
coordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates
knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven
optimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from
multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We
evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three
representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily
light rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and
reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and
system robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware,
knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban
flood response.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Model Context Protocol成为连接大语言模型与外部数据源的标准，现有评测不足以反映实际应用中的长远推理和复杂工具空间的挑战，亟需更具真实性和挑战性的评估方式。

Method: 设计了涵盖六大领域的多域、多任务的MCP-Universe基准，采用多种执行型评估手段，包括格式、静态和动态评估，同时开放源代码框架，支持多平台扩展。

Result: 实测显示顶尖模型在复杂任务中表现依然有限，尤其在长上下文和未知工具的场景中表现不佳，验证了基准的挑战性和现实意义。

Conclusion: MCP-Universe有效揭示了大模型在实际复杂环境中的局限性，为未来模型优化和工具集成提供了重要参考，推动MCP生态的创新发展。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for
connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly
gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,
existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application
challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To
address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks
through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6
core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository
Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web
Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based
evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static
evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that
automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.
Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models
such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit
significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a
significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input
tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it
introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity
with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents
like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.
Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI
support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new
agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP
ecosystem.

Result: 成功验证该方法在自动车道保持系统中的有效性，能在有限时间步内估算系统的安全概率，并提供置信度。

Conclusion: 该数据驱动、主动学习结合PAC的框架为CPS系统的安全分析提供了一种有效且具有置信度的解决方案。

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex systems that require powerful models
for tasks like verification, diagnosis, or debugging. Often, suitable models
are not available and manual extraction is difficult. Data-driven approaches
then provide a solution to, e.g., diagnosis tasks and verification problems
based on data collected from the system. In this paper, we consider CPS with a
discrete abstraction in the form of a Mealy machine. We propose a data-driven
approach to determine the safety probability of the system on a finite horizon
of n time steps. The approach is based on the Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning paradigm. Thus, we elaborate a connection between discrete logic
and probabilistic reachability analysis of systems, especially providing an
additional confidence on the determined probability. The learning process
follows an active learning paradigm, where new learning data is sampled in a
guided way after an initial learning set is collected. We validate the approach
with a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.

Result: 实验显示模型记录表面似乎具备轻量内省，但在满足新定义的深层次内省方面表现不足。

Conclusion: 需要更严格的内省定义以准确评估AI的自我认知能力，现有模型难以实现真正意义上的内省。

Abstract: Whether AI models can introspect is an increasingly important practical
question. But there is no consensus on how introspection is to be defined.
Beginning from a recently proposed ''lightweight'' definition, we argue instead
for a thicker one. According to our proposal, introspection in AI is any
process which yields information about internal states through a process more
reliable than one with equal or lower computational cost available to a third
party. Using experiments where LLMs reason about their internal temperature
parameters, we show they can appear to have lightweight introspection while
failing to meaningfully introspect per our proposed definition.

Abstract: Student dropout is a significant challenge in educational systems worldwide,
leading to substantial social and economic costs. Predicting students at risk
of dropout allows for timely interventions. While traditional Machine Learning
(ML) models operating on tabular data have shown promise, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) offer a potential advantage by capturing complex relationships inherent
in student data if structured as graphs. This paper investigates whether
transforming tabular student data into graph structures, primarily using
clustering techniques, enhances dropout prediction accuracy. We compare the
performance of GNNs (a custom Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE)
on these generated graphs against established tabular models (Random Forest
(RF), XGBoost, and TabNet) using a real-world student dataset. Our experiments
explore various graph construction strategies based on different clustering
algorithms (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques
(Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP)). Our findings demonstrate that a specific GNN configuration,
GraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieved superior
performance, notably improving the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage
points and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points over the strongest tabular
baseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction
methods did not consistently surpass tabular models, emphasizing the critical
role of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This
highlights both the potential of GNNs and the challenges in optimally
transforming tabular data for graph-based learning in this domain.

Abstract: Sparsity, defined as the presence of missing or zero values in a dataset,
often poses a major challenge while operating on real-life datasets. Sparsity
in features or target data of the training dataset can be handled using various
interpolation methods, such as linear or polynomial interpolation, spline,
moving average, or can be simply imputed. Interpolation methods usually perform
well with Strict Sense Stationary (SSS) data. In this study, we show that an
approximately 62\% sparse dataset with hourly load data of a power plant can be
utilized for load forecasting assuming the data is Wide Sense Stationary (WSS),
if augmented with Gaussian interpolation. More specifically, we perform
statistical analysis on the data, and train multiple machine learning and deep
learning models on the dataset. By comparing the performance of these models,
we empirically demonstrate that Gaussian interpolation is a suitable option for
dealing with load forecasting problems. Additionally, we demonstrate that Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network model offers the best performance
among a diverse set of classical and neural network-based models.

Abstract: This research proposes a hybrid Machine Learning and metaheuristic mechanism
that is designed to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). The main of our
method is an edge solution selector model, which classifies solution edges to
identify prohibited moves during the local search, hence guiding the search
process within metaheuristic baselines. Two learning-based mechanisms are used
to develop the edge selector: a simple tabular binary classifier and a Graph
Neural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier employs Gradient Boosting Trees
and Feedforward Neural Network as the baseline algorithms. Adjustments to the
decision threshold are also applied to handle the class imbalance in the
problem instance. An alternative mechanism employs the GNN to utilize graph
structure for direct solution edge prediction, with the objective of guiding
local search by predicting prohibited moves. These hybrid mechanisms are then
applied in state-fo-the-art metaheuristic baselines. Our method demonstrates
both scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements
across different baseline metaheuristics, various problem sizes and variants,
including the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and CVRP with Time
Windows (CVRPTW). Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets up to 30,000
customer nodes, supported by pair-wise statistical analysis, verify the
observed improvements.

integrates a fast minimal package for Exact Gaussian Processes (GPs) capable of
efficiently handling the full dimensionality of sparse molecular fingerprints

outperforms traditional methods like GP-BO by fully leveraging fingerprint
dimensionality, leading to the identification of higher-quality and valid

GP-MOBO yields higher geometric mean values across 20 Bayesian optimization

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been validated as an effective technique for
detecting Parkinson's disease,particularly in its early stages.However,the high
cost of EEG data annotation often results in limited dataset size and
considerable discrepancies across datasets,including differences in acquisition
protocols and subject demographics,significantly hinder the robustness and
generalizability of models in cross-dataset detection scenarios.To address such
challenges,this paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework named
MCLPD,which integrates multi-view contrastive pre-training with lightweight
supervised fine-tuning to enhance cross-dataset PD detection performance.During
pre-training,MCLPD uses self-supervised learning on the unlabeled UNM
dataset.To build contrastive pairs,it applies dual augmentations in both time
and frequency domains,which enrich the data and naturally fuse time-frequency
information.In the fine-tuning phase,only a small proportion of labeled data
from another two datasets (UI and UC)is used for supervised
optimization.Experimental results show that MCLPD achieves F1 scores of 0.91 on
UI and 0.81 on UC using only 1%of labeled data,which further improve to 0.97
and 0.87,respectively,when 5%of labeled data is used.Compared to existing
methods,MCLPD substantially improves cross-dataset generalization while
reducing the dependency on labeled data,demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

disease detection methods have shown significant success within individual
datasets, however, the variability in detection methods across different EEG
datasets and the small size of each dataset pose challenges for training a
generalizable model for cross-dataset scenarios. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a GAN-enhanced generalizable model, named GEPD, specifically for
EEG-based cross-dataset classification of Parkinson's disease.First, we design
a generative network that creates fusion EEG data by controlling the
distribution similarity between generated data and real data.In addition, an
EEG signal quality assessment model is designed to ensure the quality of
generated data great.Second, we design a classification network that utilizes a
combination of multiple convolutional neural networks to effectively capture
the time-frequency characteristics of EEG signals, while maintaining a
generalizable structure and ensuring easy convergence.This work is dedicated to
utilizing intelligent methods to study pathological manifestations, aiming to
facilitate the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological diseases.The evaluation
results demonstrate that our model performs comparably to state-of-the-art
models in cross-dataset settings, achieving an accuracy of 84.3% and an
F1-score of 84.0%, showcasing the generalizability of the proposed model.

Conclusion: 该方法有望推动更有效的个性化大型语言模型发展。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs), which are central to existing post-training methods, aim
to align LLM outputs with human values by providing feedback signals during
fine-tuning. However, existing RMs struggle to capture nuanced, user-specific
preferences, especially under limited data and across diverse domains. Thus, we
introduce PersRM-R1, the first reasoning-based reward modeling framework
specifically designed to identify and represent personal factors from only one
or a few personal exemplars. To address challenges including limited data
availability and the requirement for robust generalization, our approach
combines synthetic data generation with a two-stage training pipeline
consisting of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning.
Experimental results demonstrate that PersRM-R1 outperforms existing models of
similar size and matches the performance of much larger models in both accuracy
and generalizability, paving the way for more effective personalized LLMs.

Abstract: This study revisits label smoothing via a form of information bottleneck.
Under the assumption of sufficient model flexibility and no conflicting labels
for the same input, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the
model output obtained through label smoothing explores the optimal solution of
the information bottleneck. Based on this, label smoothing can be interpreted
as a practical approach to the information bottleneck, enabling simple
implementation. As an information bottleneck method, we experimentally show
that label smoothing also exhibits the property of being insensitive to factors
that do not contain information about the target, or to factors that provide no
additional information about it when conditioned on another variable.

Abstract: This research introduces a new ML framework designed to enhance the
robustness of out-of-sample hydrocarbon production forecasting, specifically
addressing multivariate time series analysis. The proposed methodology
integrates Productivity Index (PI)-driven feature selection, a concept derived
from reservoir engineering, with Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) for
rigorous uncertainty quantification. Utilizing historical data from the Volve
(wells PF14, PF12) and Norne (well E1H) oil fields, this study investigates the
efficacy of various predictive algorithms-namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) - in forecasting historical oil production rates (OPR_H).
All the models achieved "out-of-sample" production forecasts for an upcoming
future timeframe. Model performance was comprehensively evaluated using
traditional error metrics (e.g., MAE) supplemented by Forecast Bias and
Prediction Direction Accuracy (PDA) to assess bias and trend-capturing
capabilities. The PI-based feature selection effectively reduced input
dimensionality compared to conventional numerical simulation workflows. The
uncertainty quantification was addressed using the ICP framework, a
distribution-free approach that guarantees valid prediction intervals (e.g.,
95% coverage) without reliance on distributional assumptions, offering a
distinct advantage over traditional confidence intervals, particularly for
complex, non-normal data. Results demonstrated the superior performance of the
LSTM model, achieving the lowest MAE on test (19.468) and genuine out-of-sample
forecast data (29.638) for well PF14, with subsequent validation on Norne well
E1H. These findings highlight the significant potential of combining
domain-specific knowledge with advanced ML techniques to improve the
reliability of hydrocarbon production forecasts.

Abstract: Deep learning models operating in the image domain are vulnerable to small
input perturbations. For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by
training models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using
specialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more
efficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are
adapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust
fine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the
model update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss
objective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size,
and the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust
generalization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when
exposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these
design choices influence generalization remains an open question with
significant practical implications. In response, we present an empirical study
spanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3
adaptation protocols, yielding 1,440 training configurations and 7,200
robustness measurements across five perturbation types. To our knowledge, this
is the most diverse and comprehensive benchmark of robust fine-tuning to date.
While attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are
increasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in
a supervised manner on large datasets often perform best. Our analysis both
confirms and challenges prior design assumptions, highlighting promising
research directions and offering practical guidance.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a popular multimodal task that
aims to accurately detect target objects within a single image based on a given
textual expression. However, due to the limitations of earlier models,
traditional REC benchmarks either rely solely on intra-image cues or lack
sufficiently fine-grained instance annotations, making them inadequate for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC,
characterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world
knowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image.
Secondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via
fine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and
anti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics
to systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate
16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results
showing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual
grounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual
understanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are
significantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely
affect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning.
We anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards
developing more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding
frameworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal
systems for complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained using Equilibrium Propagation (EP),
a biologically plausible training algorithm, have demonstrated strong
performance in various tasks such as image classification and reinforcement
learning. However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous
learning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is
overwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the
human brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided
by processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of
learned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a
sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs. We found
that SRC significantly improves RNN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting in
continuous learning scenarios. In class-incremental learning with SRC
implemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model
(MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks
incorporating several well-established regularization techniques. The MRNN-EP
performed on par with MRNN trained using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
when both were equipped with SRC on MNIST data and surpassed BPTT-based models
on the Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.
Combining SRC with rehearsal, also known as "awake replay", further boosted the
network's ability to retain long-term knowledge while continuing to learn new
tasks. Our study reveals the applicability of sleep-like replay techniques to
RNNs and highlights the potential for integrating human-like learning behaviors
into artificial neural networks (ANNs).

Abstract: Semi-supervised regression (SSR), which aims to predict continuous scores of
samples while reducing reliance on a large amount of labeled data, has recently
received considerable attention across various applications, including computer
vision, natural language processing, and audio and medical analysis. Existing
semi-supervised methods typically apply consistency regularization on the
general regression task by generating pseudo-labels. However, these methods
heavily rely on the quality of pseudo-labels, and direct regression fails to
learn the label distribution and can easily lead to overfitting. To address
these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end Decoupled Representation
distillation framework (DRILL) which is specially designed for the
semi-supervised regression task where we transform the general regression task
into a Discrete Distribution Estimation (DDE) task over multiple buckets to
better capture the underlying label distribution and mitigate the risk of
overfitting associated with direct regression. Then we employ the Decoupled
Distribution Alignment (DDA) to align the target bucket and non-target bucket
between teacher and student on the distribution of buckets, encouraging the
student to learn more robust and generalized knowledge from the teacher.
Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from diverse domains demonstrate
that the proposed DRILL has strong generalization and outperforms the competing
methods.

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) is pivotal
for effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite
this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data
quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI.
This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a
critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key
factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The
intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad
correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.
  To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a
self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a
novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for
\underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates
with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and
their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to
exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped
prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph
from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is
fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two
real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy
data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.

Abstract: We present a scalable, parameter-aware sparse regression framework for
discovering interpretable partial differential equations and subgrid-scale
closures from multi-parameter simulation data. Building on SINDy (Sparse
Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our approach addresses key limitations
through four innovations: symbolic parameterisation enabling physical
parameters to vary within unified regression; Dimensional Similarity Filter
enforcing unit-consistency whilst reducing candidate libraries;
memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation enabling batch processing; and
ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis for robust model
identification.
  Validation on canonical one-dimensional benchmarks demonstrates reliable
recovery of governing equations across parameter ranges. Applied to filtered
Burgers datasets, the framework discovers an SGS closure $\tau_{\mathrm{SGS}} =
0.1603\cdot\Delta^2\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)^2$,
corresponding to a Smagorinsky constant of approximately 0.4004. This
represents autonomous discovery of Smagorinsky-type closure structure from data
without prior theoretical assumptions.
  The discovered model achieves $R^2 = 0.886$ across filter scales and
demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to classical closures. The
framework's ability to identify physically meaningful SGS forms and calibrate
coefficients offers a complementary approach to existing turbulence modelling
methods, contributing to the growing field of data-driven closure discovery.

Abstract: While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the
brain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning
meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to
limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation
models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer
architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language
models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG
data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large
models often incurred high computational costs during both training and
inference, with only marginal performance improvements as model size increases.
In this work, we proposed EEG representation learning framework building upon
Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed structured
state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the
temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the architecture using a Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Model. The resulting latent EEG representations were
then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion
transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used the multi-event Temple
University EEG Event Corpus and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art
approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method
outperformed existing methods while being approximately 19x more lightweight.
These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current
FMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling
large, generalizable models trained through self-supervision. This paradigm has
inspired the development of scientific foundation models (FMs). However,
applying this capability to experimental particle physics is challenging due to
the sparse, spatially distributed nature of detector data, which differs
dramatically from natural language. This work addresses if an FM for particle
physics can scale and generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce a new
dataset with more than 11 million particle collision events and a suite of
downstream tasks and labeled data for evaluation. We propose a novel
self-supervised training method for detector data and demonstrate its neural
scalability with models that feature up to 188 million parameters. With frozen
weights and task-specific adapters, this FM consistently outperforms baseline
models across all downstream tasks. The performance also exhibits robust
data-efficient adaptation. Further analysis reveals that the representations
extracted by the FM are task-agnostic but can be specialized via a single
linear mapping for different downstream tasks.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in human mobility is essential for applications such as
public safety and urban planning. While traditional anomaly detection methods
primarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at
home at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in
collective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home
alone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge.
Unlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling
spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional
complexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to
capture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first
formulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences
(CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event
sequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention
mechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions
across multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior
data through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to
detect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies
and absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior
work. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that
CoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving
an improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR. All source code is

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are often used for the task of link prediction:
predicting missing binary facts in knowledge graphs (KGs). To address the lack
of explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs
with provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to
explain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the
expressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a
form of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph
encoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular
approach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN
output into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be
adapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for
explaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules
that scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining
equivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring
functions. Our experiments show that, on link prediction benchmarks, monotonic
GNNs and scoring functions perform well in practice and yield many sound rules.

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) provide a structured way to specify non-Markovian
rewards in reinforcement learning (RL), thereby improving both expressiveness
and programmability. Viewed more broadly, they separate what is known about the
environment, captured by the reward mechanism, from what remains unknown and
must be discovered through sampling. This separation supports techniques such
as counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping, which reduce sample
complexity and speed up learning. We introduce physics-informed reward machines
(pRMs), a symbolic machine designed to express complex learning objectives and
reward structures for RL agents, thereby enabling more programmable,
expressive, and efficient learning. We present RL algorithms capable of
exploiting pRMs via counterfactual experiences and reward shaping. Our
experimental results show that these techniques accelerate reward acquisition
during the training phases of RL. We demonstrate the expressiveness and
effectiveness of pRMs through experiments in both finite and continuous
physical environments, illustrating that incorporating pRMs significantly
improves learning efficiency across several control tasks.

Abstract: Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is
expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be
procured. We investigate a critical question for resource-constrained
alignment: under a fixed acquisition budget, should practitioners prioritize
examples that are easy, medium, hard, or of random difficulty? We study Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning across different model sizes
and families, comparing four subset selection policies chosen from the same
unlabeled pool using base-model difficulty estimates obtained via multi-sample
evaluation. Our experiments reveal that training on the hardest examples yields
the largest performance gains, up to 47%, while training on easy examples yield
the smallest gains. Analysis reveals that this effect arises from harder
examples providing more learnable opportunities during GRPO training. These
findings provide practical guidance for budget-constrained post-training:
prioritizing hard examples yields substantial performance gains on reasoning
tasks when using GRPO.

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order
relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains,
including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural
networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn
latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive
tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small
number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then
utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a
cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego
long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly
increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also
degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.
  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture
long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance.
Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency
issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing
hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more
information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit
Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns
fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end
manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we
introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model
efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node
classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in
most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.

Abstract: Trust region-based optimization methods have become foundational
reinforcement learning algorithms that offer stability and strong empirical
performance in continuous control tasks. Growing interest in scalable and
reusable control policies translate also in a demand for morphological
generalization, the ability of control policies to cope with different
kinematic structures. Graph-based policy architectures provide a natural and
effective mechanism to encode such structural differences. However, while these
architectures accommodate variable morphologies, the behavior of trust region
methods under varying action space dimensionality remains poorly understood. To
this end, we conduct a theoretical analysis of trust region-based policy
optimization methods, focusing on both Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
and its widely used first-order approximation, Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO). The goal is to demonstrate how varying action space dimensionality
influence the optimization landscape, particularly under the constraints
imposed by KL-divergence or policy clipping penalties. Complementing the
theoretical insights, an empirical evaluation under morphological variation is
carried out using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment. This benchmark offers a
systematically controlled setting for varying the kinematic structure without
altering the underlying task, making it particularly well-suited to study
morphological generalization.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping scientific discovery, evolving from

Agentic Science as a pivotal stage within the broader AI for Science paradigm,
where AI systems progress from partial assistance to full scientific agency.
Enabled by large language models (LLMs), multimodal systems, and integrated

experimental design, execution, analysis, and iterative refinement -- behaviors
once regarded as uniquely human. This survey provides a domain-oriented review
of autonomous scientific discovery across life sciences, chemistry, materials
science, and physics. We unify three previously fragmented perspectives --
process-oriented, autonomy-oriented, and mechanism-oriented -- through a
comprehensive framework that connects foundational capabilities, core
processes, and domain-specific realizations. Building on this framework, we (i)
trace the evolution of AI for Science, (ii) identify five core capabilities
underpinning scientific agency, (iii) model discovery as a dynamic four-stage
workflow, (iv) review applications across the above domains, and (v) synthesize
key challenges and future opportunities. This work establishes a

Abstract: As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in
managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly
pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking
spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability
of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing
efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a
smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps,
mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture
parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive
days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require
any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to
provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location
services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to
specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear
Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR),
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was
employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of
Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142
and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an
LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.

Abstract: Designing shape memory alloys (SMAs) that meet performance targets while
remaining affordable and sustainable is a complex challenge. In this work, we
focus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start
temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning
models as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to
search for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine
learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of
experimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The
tree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the
neural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a
gradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR). Our results show that while both
models predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural
network finds better solutions more consistently. COBYLA often converged to
suboptimal results, especially when the starting guess was far from the target.
The TRUST-CONSTR method showed more stable behavior and was better at reaching
alloy compositions that met both objectives. This study demonstrates a
practical approach to exploring new SMA compositions by combining
physics-informed data, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms.
Although the scale of our dataset is smaller than simulation-based efforts, the
use of experimental data improves the reliability of the predictions. The
approach can be extended to other materials where design trade-offs must be
made with limited data.

Conclusion: ERIS通过结合语义指导和结构约束，提出了一种有效的时间序列特征解缠方案，有助于模型在实际应用中的稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant
representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models
inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in
spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this,
current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required
to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\textbf{ERIS}) framework
to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that
effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also
semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key
mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an
energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance
for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a
weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between
domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their
interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances
robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that
ERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy
across four benchmarks.

Abstract: Modal testing plays a critical role in structural analysis by providing
essential insights into dynamic behaviour across a wide range of engineering
industries. In practice, designing an effective modal test campaign involves
complex experimental planning, comprising a series of interdependent decisions
that significantly influence the final test outcome. Traditional approaches to
test design are typically static-focusing only on global tests without
accounting for evolving test campaign parameters or the impact of such changes
on previously established decisions, such as sensor configurations, which have
been found to significantly influence test outcomes. These rigid methodologies
often compromise test accuracy and adaptability. To address these limitations,
this study introduces an agent-based decision support framework for adaptive
sensor placement across dynamically changing modal test environments. The
framework formulates the problem using an underspecified partially observable
Markov decision process, enabling the training of a generalist reinforcement
learning agent through a dual-curriculum learning strategy. A detailed case
study on a steel cantilever structure demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed
method in optimising sensor locations across frequency segments, validating its
robustness and real-world applicability in experimental settings.

Conclusion: 提出的元学习框架有效缓解了检测器稀缺问题，具有良好的迁移学习能力，为城市交通管理提供新的技术手段。

Abstract: The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram is a popular tool used to describe
traffic dynamics in an aggregated way, with applications ranging from traffic
control to incident analysis. However, estimating the MFD for a given network
requires large numbers of loop detectors, which is not always available in
practice. This article proposes a framework harnessing meta-learning, a
subcategory of machine learning that trains models to understand and adapt to
new tasks on their own, to alleviate the data scarcity challenge. The developed
model is trained and tested by leveraging data from multiple cities and
exploiting it to model the MFD of other cities with different shares of
detectors and topological structures. The proposed meta-learning framework is
applied to an ad-hoc Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network, specifically
designed to estimate the MFD. Results show an average MSE improvement in flow
prediction ranging between ~ 17500 and 36000 (depending on the subset of loop
detectors tested). The meta-learning framework thus successfully generalizes
across diverse urban settings and improves performance on cities with limited
data, demonstrating the potential of using meta-learning when a limited number
of detectors is available. Finally, the proposed framework is validated against
traditional transfer learning approaches and tested with FitFun, a
non-parametric model from the literature, to prove its transferability.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，显著降低能耗并提升准确率，优于前沿模型。

Conclusion: STAS框架有效推动SNNs在视觉任务中的应用，兼顾能效与性能。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural
networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to
their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation
methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or
architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the
principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a
unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is
hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity
prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its
principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal
Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that
co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS
introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish
temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving
the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn,
allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform
two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes.
Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%,
and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA
models.

Abstract: The structure of biological neural circuits-modular, hierarchical, and
sparsely interconnected-reflects an efficient trade-off between wiring cost,
functional specialization, and robustness. These principles offer valuable
insights for artificial neural network (ANN) design, especially as networks
grow in depth and scale. Sparsity, in particular, has been widely explored for
reducing memory and computation, improving speed, and enhancing generalization.
Motivated by systems neuroscience findings, we explore how patterns of
functional connectivity in the mouse visual cortex-specifically,
ensemble-to-ensemble communication, can inform ANN design. We introduce G2GNet,
a novel architecture that imposes sparse, modular connectivity across
feedforward layers. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than fully
connected models, G2GNet achieves superior accuracy on standard vision
benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first architecture to incorporate
biologically observed functional connectivity patterns as a structural bias in
ANN design. We complement this static bias with a dynamic sparse training (DST)
mechanism that prunes and regrows edges during training. We also propose a
Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations, drawing on
principles of biological plasticity. G2GNet achieves up to 75% sparsity while
improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on benchmarks, including Fashion-MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, outperforming dense baselines with far fewer
computations.

Conclusion: MAI作为一种结合生物启发与结构重用的认知模型，具有重要的理论意义和应用潜力，推动AI向更高效、更智能的方向发展。

Abstract: Intelligence is fundamentally non-ergodic: it emerges not from uniform
sampling or optimization from scratch, but from the structured reuse of prior
inference trajectories. We introduce Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) as a
formal framework in which cognition is modeled as inference over latent cycles
in memory, rather than recomputation through gradient descent. MAI systems
encode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling
context-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive
systems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent
manifolds, guided by persistent topological memory. Through the lens of
delta-homology, we show that MAI provides a principled foundation for
Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, modeling each cortical column as a
local inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states. Furthermore, we
establish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning:
whereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes
backward from memory. This inversion paves a path toward energy-efficient
inference and addresses the computational bottlenecks facing modern AI. MAI
thus offers a unified, biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on
structure, reuse, and memory. We also briefly discuss the profound implications
of MAI for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptaion (LoRA) is a
cost-effective way to incorporate information from a specific dataset. However,
it is often unclear how well the fine-tuned LLM will generalize, i.e., how well
it will perform on unseen datasets. Methods have been proposed to improve
generalization by optimizing with in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning
to fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and
computation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of
parameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these
challenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This
method builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting
this approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency. We
reframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a
set of new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity
of task-specific parameters to the global ones. ABMLL provides effective
generalization and scales to large models such as Llama3-8B. Furthermore, as a
result of using a Bayesian framework, ABMLL provides improved uncertainty
quantification. We test ABMLL on Unified-QA and CrossFit datasets and find that
it outperforms existing methods on these benchmarks in terms of both accuracy
and expected calibration error.

Conclusion: 强调结合交通场景复杂度的评估方法，有助于开发更可靠的船舶轨迹预测模型，提升水路交通安全和效率。

Abstract: This contribution addresses vessel trajectory prediction (VTP), focusing on
the evaluation of different deep learning-based approaches. The objective is to
assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the
reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific
traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research
uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in
varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution
analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to
their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics
and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this
comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and
weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability
in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be
guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel
trajectory prediction approaches, enhancing safety and efficiency in future
inland waterways navigation.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge hardware demands aggressive,
prompt-aware dynamic pruning to reduce computation without degrading quality.
Static or predictor-based schemes either lock in a single sparsity pattern or
incur extra runtime overhead, and recent zero-shot methods that rely on
statistics from a single prompt fail on short prompt and/or long generation
scenarios. We introduce A/I-GLASS: Activation- and Impact-based Global-Local
neural importance Aggregation for feed-forward network SparSification, two
training-free methods that dynamically select FFN units using a
rank-aggregation of prompt local and model-intrinsic global neuron statistics.
Empirical results across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that GLASS
significantly outperforms prior training-free methods, particularly in
challenging long-form generation scenarios, without relying on auxiliary
predictors or adding any inference overhead.

Motivation: Not available

Method: Not available

Result: Not available

Conclusion: Not available

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide explicit interpretations for deep
neural networks through concepts and allow intervention with concepts to adjust
final predictions. Existing CBMs assume concepts are conditionally independent
given labels and isolated from each other, ignoring the hidden relationships
among concepts. However, the set of concepts in CBMs often has an intrinsic
structure where concepts are generally correlated: changing one concept will
inherently impact its related concepts. To mitigate this limitation, we propose
GraphCBMs: a new variant of CBM that facilitates concept relationships by
constructing latent concept graphs, which can be combined with CBMs to enhance
model performance while retaining their interpretability. Our experiment
results on real-world image classification tasks demonstrate Graph CBMs offer
the following benefits: (1) superior in image classification tasks while
providing more concept structure information for interpretability; (2) able to
utilize latent concept graphs for more effective interventions; and (3) robust
in performance across different training and architecture settings.

the learning of time-varying convexifications of multiple fairness measures
with limited graph-structured feedback.

Conclusion: 将 RL 训练中学习到的奖励函数作为一本强大、经济的奖励模型，增强推理的稳定性和泛化能力，推动大模型推理能力提升。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen
into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods
that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low
sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently
trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or
LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this
paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and
search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function
learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding
downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to
learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely
eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the
resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a
heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning
chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task
generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including
mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our
unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,
matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,
our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.
These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best
PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex
reasoning tasks in LLMs.

Conclusion: 教师指导在自主网络安全中的应用潜力巨大，有助于提升ACO的训练效率。

Abstract: Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) rely on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
train agents to make effective decisions in the cybersecurity domain. However,
existing ACO applications require agents to learn from scratch, leading to slow
convergence and poor early-stage performance. While teacher-guided techniques
have demonstrated promise in other domains, they have not yet been applied to
ACO. In this study, we implement four distinct teacher-guided techniques in the
simulated CybORG environment and conduct a comparative evaluation. Our results
demonstrate that teacher integration can significantly improve training
efficiency in terms of early policy performance and convergence speed,

Conclusion: 所提方法有效应对数据不足和检测不完美的问题，为野生动物保护中的偷猎预测提供了一种具有潜力的解决方案。

Abstract: Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable
step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform
patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching
prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the
expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent
advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more
flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data
faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited
data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an
occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the
underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite
flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which
is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving
generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show
consistent gains in predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Sub-grid parameterisations in climate models are traditionally static and
tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving states. This work introduces
FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors
the spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by
assigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with
periodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance
climate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble
(ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under
different FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent
baselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and
mid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to
transfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited
for geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a
scalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for
physically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a
changing climate. Code accessible at

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new
possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce
Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via
LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g.,
cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on
system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination
using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from
7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution
trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high
simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and
robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU
patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution
shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical
multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with
coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care
physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert
ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations
under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and
APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early
warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops
(<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results
position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital
twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in
critical care.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various
real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social
media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to
their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant
computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and
processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce
these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the
essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's
predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation
approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level
optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and
original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this
sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn
linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent
and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph
condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a
novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition
(GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an
informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance.
Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD
effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up
to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive
performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches. Our code is

Conclusion: NeRC通过创新训练策略和端到端学习，有效改善城市环境下的GNSS定位，为移动设备导航提供了有力解决方案。

Abstract: GNSS localization using everyday mobile devices is challenging in urban
environments, as ranging errors caused by the complex propagation of satellite
signals and low-quality onboard GNSS hardware are blamed for undermining
positioning accuracy. Researchers have pinned their hopes on data-driven
methods to regress such ranging errors from raw measurements. However, the
grueling annotation of ranging errors impedes their pace. This paper presents a
robust end-to-end Neural Ranging Correction (NeRC) framework, where
localization-related metrics serve as the task objective for training the
neural modules. Instead of seeking impractical ranging error labels, we train
the neural network using ground-truth locations that are relatively easy to
obtain. This functionality is supported by differentiable moving horizon
location estimation (MHE) that handles a horizon of measurements for
positioning and backpropagates the gradients for training. Even better, as a
blessing of end-to-end learning, we propose a new training paradigm using
Euclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps, which alleviates the demands on
labeled locations. We evaluate the proposed NeRC on public benchmarks and our
collected datasets, demonstrating its distinguished improvement in positioning
accuracy. We also deploy NeRC on the edge to verify its real-time performance
for mobile devices.

Result: 在CAGE-2基准测试中，MOBAL在适应性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOBAL是一种有效的网络攻防响应工具，能动态适应模型误设，提高应急响应的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Effective responses to cyberattacks require fast decisions, even when
information about the attack is incomplete or inaccurate. However, most
decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system
model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In
this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for
incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL:
Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture
about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available,
which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine
effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite
Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic
programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with
respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on
misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark
show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and
robustness to model misspecification.

Conclusion: DuPO为LLM偏好优化提供了一个高效、普适、无需标注的解决方案，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: We present DuPO, a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that
generates annotation-free feedback via a generalized duality. DuPO addresses
two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s
reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and
traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g.,
translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal
task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task
to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information
(e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening
applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction
serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing
with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically,
DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average
translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical
reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks,
and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading
computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general,
and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.

Abstract: This paper studies the interplay between learning algorithms and graph
structure for graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing theoretical studies on the
learning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning
algorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude
connection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum
degree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk
(generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the
generalization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional
settings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine
how graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several
key contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure
and learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and
Ridge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure
through spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further
explore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the
performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we
extend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing
non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights
into the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning
algorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions,
\emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs
and learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and
selection in practice.}

underexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are
governed by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a
system of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are
governed by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing
convergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present
the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the
convergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph
generation paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)
graph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation
of both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique
factors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph
structure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer
theoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling
steps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to
improve convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a
controlled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align
with our theoretical predictions. This work deepens the theoretical
understanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their applicability in critical domains,
and provides practical guidance for designing effective models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对图生成模型在大规模图和不同规模泛化方面的局限性，推动模型的扩大应用和适应性提升。

Conclusion: SBGD通过分解复杂图结构，有效提升了扩展性和泛化能力，为生成模型的模块化发展提供新的思路。

Abstract: Graph diffusion generative models (GDGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
generating high-quality graphs. However, their broader adoption faces
challenges in \emph{scalability and size generalization}. GDGMs struggle to
scale to large graphs due to their high memory requirements, as they typically
operate in the full graph space, requiring the entire graph to be stored in
memory during training and inference. This constraint limits their feasibility
for large-scale real-world graphs. GDGMs also exhibit poor size generalization,
with limited ability to generate graphs of sizes different from those in the
training data, restricting their adaptability across diverse applications. To
address these challenges, we propose the stochastic block graph diffusion
(SBGD) model, which refines graph representations into a block graph space.
This space incorporates structural priors based on real-world graph patterns,
significantly reducing memory complexity and enabling scalability to large
graphs. The block representation also improves size generalization by capturing
fundamental graph structures. Empirical results show that SBGD achieves
significant memory improvements (up to 6$\times$) while maintaining comparable
or even superior graph generation performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that SBGD better generalizes to
unseen graph sizes. The significance of SBGD extends beyond being a scalable
and effective GDGM; it also exemplifies the principle of modularization in
generative modeling, offering a new avenue for exploring generative models by
decomposing complex tasks into more manageable components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Shapley值在高维特征空间中的计算复杂度问题，特别是在概率模型如高斯过程中的应用限制。

Method: 利用FANOVA GP的结构特性，结合封闭形式的(Möbius)表示和递归算法，计算局部与全局Shapley值的期望与方差。

Result: 实现了在二次时间内精确计算局部与全局Shapley值，提供了不确定性编码的解释方法，验证了其效率和实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了结构化概率模型的可解释性，为复杂模型的可解释AI发展提供新的解决方案。

Abstract: Shapley values are widely recognized as a principled method for attributing
importance to input features in machine learning. However, the exact
computation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features,
severely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The
challenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as
in Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather
than point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling
higher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class
of GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and
interactions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global
explanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise
explanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components
and compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only,
capturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global
explanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and
compute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the
model's overall sensitivity. Our methods leverage a closed-form (stochastic)
M\"{o}bius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive
algorithms, inspired by Newton's identities, to efficiently compute the mean
and variance of Shapley values. Our work enhances the utility of explainable
AI, as demonstrated by empirical studies, by providing more scalable,
axiomatically sound, and uncertainty-aware explanations for predictions
generated by structured probabilistic models.

Conclusion: 极少潜在状态甚至单潜在状态的训练扩散模型在保持性能的同时，大幅提升训练速度，为扩散模型的应用提供新的可能。

Abstract: We challenge a fundamental assumption of diffusion models, namely, that a
large number of latent-states or time-steps is required for training so that
the reverse generative process is close to a Gaussian. We first show that with
careful selection of a noise schedule, diffusion models trained over a small
number of latent states (i.e. $T \sim 32$) match the performance of models
trained over a much large number of latent states ($T \sim 1,000$). Second, we
push this limit (on the minimum number of latent states required) to a single
latent-state, which we refer to as complete disentanglement in T-space. We show
that high quality samples can be easily generated by the disentangled model
obtained by combining several independently trained single latent-state models.
We provide extensive experiments to show that the proposed disentangled model
provides 4-6$\times$ faster convergence measured across a variety of metrics on
two different datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的神经网络难以高效表示复杂的价值函数，应探索更优的特征表示方法。

Method: 在DQN中集成切比雪夫多项式基，利用其优良的逼近能力，提升学习效率和性能。

Result: 在CartPole-v1环境中，中等阶数(4次)的Ch-DQN显著优于标准DQN，性能提升约39%。过高阶数反而影响学习效果。

Conclusion: 使用正交多项式基方法具有潜力，但需权衡模型复杂度以优化性能。

Abstract: The performance of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is critically dependent on the
ability of its underlying neural network to accurately approximate the
action-value function. Standard function approximators, such as multi-layer
perceptrons, may struggle to efficiently represent the complex value landscapes
inherent in many reinforcement learning problems. This paper introduces a novel
architecture, the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates a Chebyshev
polynomial basis into the DQN framework to create a more effective feature
representation. By leveraging the powerful function approximation properties of
Chebyshev polynomials, we hypothesize that the Ch-DQN can learn more
efficiently and achieve higher performance. We evaluate our proposed model on
the CartPole-v1 benchmark and compare it against a standard DQN with a
comparable number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that the Ch-DQN with a
moderate polynomial degree (N=4) achieves significantly better asymptotic
performance, outperforming the baseline by approximately 39\%. However, we also
find that the choice of polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter, as a
high degree (N=8) can be detrimental to learning. This work validates the
potential of using orthogonal polynomial bases in deep reinforcement learning
while also highlighting the trade-offs involved in model complexity.

Abstract: Wearable sensor data offer opportunities for personalized health monitoring,
yet deriving actionable insights from their complex, longitudinal data streams
is challenging. This paper introduces a framework to learn personalized
counterfactual models from multivariate wearable data. This enables exploring
what-if scenarios to understand potential individual-specific outcomes of
lifestyle choices. Our approach first augments individual datasets with data
from similar patients via multi-modal similarity analysis. We then use a
temporal PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm adaptation to discover predictive
relationships, modeling how variables at time t-1 influence physiological
changes at time t. Gradient Boosting Machines are trained on these discovered
relationships to quantify individual-specific effects. These models drive a
counterfactual engine projecting physiological trajectories under hypothetical
interventions (e.g., activity or sleep changes). We evaluate the framework via
one-step-ahead predictive validation and by assessing the plausibility and
impact of interventions. Evaluation showed reasonable predictive accuracy
(e.g., mean heart rate MAE 4.71 bpm) and high counterfactual plausibility
(median 0.9643). Crucially, these interventions highlighted significant
inter-individual variability in response to hypothetical lifestyle changes,
showing the framework's potential for personalized insights. This work provides
a tool to explore personalized health dynamics and generate hypotheses on
individual responses to lifestyle changes.

Motivation: 优化大规模语言模型（LLM）推理调度以降低延迟和能耗，解决输出长度不确定的问题。

Result: 自适应算法在数值模拟中接近最佳调度，表现出高效和鲁棒性，且仅依赖于预测下界。

Conclusion: 提出的算法有效应对输出长度不确定性，提升LLM推理调度效率，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference
scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task
service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM
processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore,
it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power
consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key
challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known
upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and
processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms
that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the
prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each
request.
  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which
schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to
prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as
prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to
potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted
lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during
inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale
competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler,
highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios.
Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the
prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output
length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的符号回归评估主要关注单一表达式形式的重现，且常采用计算机代数系统，导致评估偏颇，且未考虑提前停止的问题。

Method: 引入合理表达式列表和回调机制，改进现有基准检测流程，对两个SR工具进行了重新评估。

Result: 新方法显著提升了两工具的重现率，同时降低了计算开销，尤其是对SymbolicRegression.jl和TiSR。

Conclusion: 改进后的基准方法更全面有效，有助于公正评估符号回归算法性能。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) uncovers mathematical models from data. Several
benchmarks have been proposed to compare the performance of SR algorithms.
However, existing ground-truth rediscovery benchmarks overemphasize the
recovery of "the one" expression form or rely solely on computer algebra
systems (such as SymPy) to assess success. Furthermore, existing benchmarks
continue the expression search even after its discovery. We improve upon these
issues by introducing curated lists of acceptable expressions, and a callback
mechanism for early termination. As a starting point, we use the symbolic
regression for scientific discovery (SRSD) benchmark problems proposed by
Yoshitomo et al., and benchmark the two SR packages SymbolicRegression.jl and
TiSR. The new benchmarking method increases the rediscovery rate of
SymbolicRegression.jl from 26.7%, as reported by Yoshitomo et at., to 44.7%.
Performing the benchmark takes 41.2% less computational expense. TiSR's
rediscovery rate is 69.4%, while performing the benchmark saves 63% time.

Motivation: 特征工程在时间序列预测中至关重要，但手工操作耗时且依赖经验，现有自动化方法缺乏效率和行业知识整合。

Method: ELATE结合语言模型和进化框架，利用统计 Measures 和特征重要性指标指导特征选择，生成新的特征变换。

Result: 在多个领域的实验中，ELATE平均提升预测准确率8.4%，表现优异。

Conclusion: ELATE成功实现了时间序列特征工程的自动化，提升了模型性能，有助于实际应用。

Abstract: Time-series prediction involves forecasting future values using machine
learning models. Feature engineering, whereby existing features are transformed
to make new ones, is critical for enhancing model performance, but is often
manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive
enumeration, which can be computationally costly and lacks domain-specific
insights. We introduce ELATE (Evolutionary Language model for Automated
Time-series Engineering), which leverages a language model within an
evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data.
ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics
to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new,
contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that
ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various
domains.

Conclusion: 引入对抗生成模型，动态生成符合医学背景的基线，有效改善模型解释性，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: The explainability of deep learning models remains a significant challenge,
particularly in the medical domain where interpretable outputs are critical for
clinical trust and transparency. Path attribution methods such as Integrated
Gradients rely on a baseline input representing the absence of relevant
features ("missingness"). Commonly used baselines, such as all-zero inputs, are
often semantically meaningless, especially in medical contexts where
missingness can itself be informative. While alternative baseline choices have
been explored, existing methods lack a principled approach to dynamically
select baselines tailored to each input. In this work, we examine the notion of
missingness in the medical setting, analyze its implications for baseline
selection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the
limitations of conventional baselines. We argue that a clinically normal but
input-close counterfactual represents a more accurate representation of a
meaningful absence of features in medical data. To implement this, we use a
Variational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines, though our
concept is generative-model-agnostic and can be applied with any suitable
counterfactual method. We evaluate the approach on three distinct medical data
sets and empirically demonstrate that counterfactual baselines yield more
faithful and medically relevant attributions compared to standard baseline
choices.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，语义能量显著提升了幻觉检测和不确定性估计的准确性，为后续应用提供更可靠的信号。

Conclusion: 语义能量框架有效弥补了语义熵在捕获模型固有不确定性方面的不足，增强了大语言模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce
fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making.
Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations.
For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic
diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations.
However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to
capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in
certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel
uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs
by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic
clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better
captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across
multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves
hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable
signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.

Conclusion: AFABench为AFA研究提供了重要的评估工具，推动相关方法的优化与创新。

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, acquiring all features of a data instance can
be expensive or impractical due to monetary cost, latency, or privacy concerns.
Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) addresses this challenge by dynamically
selecting a subset of informative features for each data instance, trading
predictive performance against acquisition cost. While numerous methods have
been proposed for AFA, ranging from greedy information-theoretic strategies to
non-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of
these methods has been hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this
paper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our
benchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports
a wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that
enables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate
representative algorithms from all major categories, including static, greedy,
and reinforcement learning-based approaches. To test the lookahead capabilities
of AFA policies, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset, AFAContext, designed
to expose the limitations of greedy selection. Our results highlight key
trade-offs between different AFA strategies and provide actionable insights for
future research. The benchmark code is available at:

Abstract: This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer
architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address
the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in
cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer
module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using
a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual
semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to
extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and
parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to
dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision,
enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input
modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed,
covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task
scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's
temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate
performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity
analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios,
and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision,
recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection
performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior
capability in complex cloud environments.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of road user movement is increasingly required by many
applications ranging from advanced driver assistance systems to autonomous
driving, and especially crucial for road safety. Even though most traffic
accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention,
as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this
work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal
trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both
physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based
modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual
nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph
attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future
trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from
psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed
ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions --
and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds
state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling
experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle
trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.

Abstract: Current SMILES-based diffusion models for molecule generation typically
support only unimodal constraint. They inject conditioning signals at the start
of the training process and require retraining a new model from scratch
whenever the constraint changes. However, real-world applications often involve
multiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints
may emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a
pre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but
also to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we
propose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion
Language Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities:
molecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure
Control Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two
distinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM
to inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively
anchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further
introducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated
molecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets.
Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
adaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement
in molecular generation for drug discovery applications.

Abstract: Designing therapeutic peptides with tailored properties is hindered by the
vastness of sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor
interpretability of current generative models. To address these challenges, we
introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language
models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly
reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling
interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological
properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity
and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence
variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with
significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming
existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both
optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first
LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with
RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent
peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.

Motivation: 解决跨设备联邦学习中由不同类型漂移导致的模型性能下降，特别是在高度异质性数据环境中。

Result: 实验证明FedEve在异质性强的非独立同分布数据上优于现有方法，有效改善模型性能。

Conclusion: 提出的FedEve框架能有效缓解数据异质性带来的客户端漂移与周期漂移问题，增强跨设备联邦学习的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows multiple
clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exposing their private
data. Data heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in FL, which can result in
poor convergence and performance degradation. Client drift has been recognized
as one of the factors contributing to this issue resulting from the multiple
local updates in FedAvg. However, in cross-device FL, a different form of drift
arises due to the partial client participation, but it has not been studied
well. This drift, we referred as period drift, occurs as participating clients
at each communication round may exhibit distinct data distribution that
deviates from that of all clients. It could be more harmful than client drift
since the optimization objective shifts with every round.
  In this paper, we investigate the interaction between period drift and client
drift, finding that period drift can have a particularly detrimental effect on
cross-device FL as the degree of data heterogeneity increases. To tackle these
issues, we propose a predict-observe framework and present an instantiated
method, FedEve, where these two types of drift can compensate each other to
mitigate their overall impact. We provide theoretical evidence that our
approach can reduce the variance of model updates. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms alternatives on non-iid data in
cross-device settings.

Result: 该框架在理论上提供了更优或等同的收敛保证，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 动态拓扑和非均匀节点贡献策略对提升分布式训练性能具有重要意义。

Abstract: One of the most common methods to train machine learning algorithms today is
the stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In a distributed setting, SGD-based
algorithms have been shown to converge theoretically under specific
circumstances. A substantial number of works in the distributed SGD setting
assume a fixed topology for the edge devices. These papers also assume that the
contribution of nodes to the global model is uniform. However, experiments have
shown that such assumptions are suboptimal and a non uniform aggregation
strategy coupled with a dynamically shifting topology and client selection can
significantly improve the performance of such models. This paper details a
unified framework that covers several Local-Update SGD-based distributed
algorithms with dynamic topologies and provides improved or matching
theoretical guarantees on convergence compared to existing work.

Result: 不同密度比估计核心会显著影响公平性测量的结果，甚至导致不同算法公平性排序的不一致。

Conclusion: 当前基于密度比的公平测量方法存在核心选择敏感性问题，亟需改进以提升其可靠性。

Abstract: The prevalence of algorithmic bias in Machine Learning (ML)-driven approaches
has inspired growing research on measuring and mitigating bias in the ML
domain. Accordingly, prior research studied how to measure fairness in
regression which is a complex problem. In particular, recent research proposed
to formulate it as a density-ratio estimation problem and relied on a Logistic
Regression-driven probabilistic classifier-based approach to solve it. However,
there are several other methods to estimate a density ratio, and to the best of
our knowledge, prior work did not study the sensitivity of such fairness
measurement methods to the choice of underlying density ratio estimation
algorithm. To fill this gap, this paper develops a set of fairness measurement
methods with various density-ratio estimation cores and thoroughly investigates
how different cores would affect the achieved level of fairness. Our
experimental results show that the choice of density-ratio estimation core
could significantly affect the outcome of fairness measurement method, and
even, generate inconsistent results with respect to the relative fairness of
various algorithms. These observations suggest major issues with density-ratio
estimation based fairness measurement in regression and a need for further
research to enhance their reliability.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效融合结构优化与信息压缩，为动态图学习提供新途径。

Abstract: Temporal graph learning is crucial for dynamic networks where nodes and edges
evolve over time and new nodes continuously join the system. Inductive
representation learning in such settings faces two major challenges:
effectively representing unseen nodes and mitigating noisy or redundant graph
information. We propose GTGIB, a versatile framework that integrates Graph
Structure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). We
design a novel two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize
node neighborhoods and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through
theoretical proofs and experiments. The TGIB refines the optimized graph by
extending the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs, regularizing
both edges and features based on our derived tractable TGIB objective function
via variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization.
GTGIB-based models are evaluated to predict links on four real-world datasets;
they outperform existing methods in all datasets under the inductive setting,
with significant and consistent improvement in the transductive setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着背后能源源如太阳能和电池存储的应用增加，传统的NILM方法在检测中受到干扰，性能下降。

Method: 提出基于Transformer的DualNILM框架，结合序列到点和序列到序列策略，实现用电状态识别与注入能量识别双任务。

Result: 在自采集和合成数据集上验证，DualNILM显著优于传统方法，保持优异性能。

Conclusion: DualNILM有效应对背后能源源干扰，提升NILM应用的适应性和准确性。

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain
fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building
applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter energy
sources, such as solar panels and battery storage, poses new challenges for
conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The injected
energy from the behind-the-meter sources can obscure the power signatures of
individual appliances, leading to a significant decline in NILM performance. To
address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning
framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and
injected energy identification in NILM. By integrating sequence-to-point and
sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture,
DualNILM can effectively capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in the
aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state
recognition and energy injection identification. We conduct validation of
DualNILM using both self-collected and synthesized open NILM datasets that
include both appliance-level energy consumption and energy injection. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that DualNILM maintains an excellent
performance for the dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出两种检验相似性选择中违反无关替代假设（IIA）的方法：经典的拟合优度检验和基于后验预测检测（PPC）的贝叶斯方法。实验证明在两个数据集都存在显著的IIA违反，且该违反由上下文效应引起，强调需要考虑上下文影响的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究相似性选择中的IIA假设被频繁违反，然而缺乏有效检验手段，特别是在目标依赖的情况下。

Method: 提出经典的拟合优度检验和贝叶斯的PPC检验，用以检测IIA的违反，并开发新的PPC检验以检测群体同质性。

Result: 在两个不同数据集上检验均发现显著的IIA违反，且上下文效应是主要原因。

Conclusion: 需要开发考虑上下文影响的相似性选择模型，以更准确描述实际行为。

Abstract: Similarity choice data occur when humans make choices among alternatives
based on their similarity to a target, e.g., in the context of information
retrieval and in embedding learning settings. Classical metric-based models of
similarity choice assume independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), a
property that allows for a simpler formulation. While IIA violations have been
detected in many discrete choice settings, the similarity choice setting has
received scant attention. This is because the target-dependent nature of the
choice complicates IIA testing. We propose two statistical methods to test for
IIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian counterpart based on the
framework of Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our
main technical contribution, quantifies the degree of IIA violation beyond its
mere significance. We curate two datasets: one with choice sets designed to
elicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated choice sets from the
same item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations on both
datasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between them.
Further, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity. Results show that
the population is indeed homogenous, suggesting that the IIA violations are
driven by context effects -- specifically, interactions within the choice sets.
These results highlight the need for new similarity choice models that account
for such context effects.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种结合模糊逻辑、可解释AI和SHAP分析的模型，用于分析和改善连续下降操作（CDO）的性能，确保其透明性和操作安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在弥补现有方法缺乏透明度和系统性分析的不足，提升CDO操作的效率与信任度。

Method: 通过收集ADS-B数据，利用机器学习模型结合SHAP分析确定影响CDO的关键特征，再基于这些特征构建模糊规则，形成可解释的检测模型。

Result: 模型在分类准确率方面表现优异（超过90%），识别出影响CDO的关键因素如平均下降率、下降段数和航向变化，并提供了可操作的模糊规则。

Conclusion: 该方法为飞行操作提供了透明、可靠的决策支持工具，具备潜在的实时应用价值，能提升CDO的执行效率与安全性。

Abstract: Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) involve smooth, idle-thrust descents that
avoid level-offs, reducing fuel burn, emissions, and noise while improving
efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite its operational and environmental
benefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing
CDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as
trajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where
explainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study
addresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI)
framework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive
dataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related
features, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then
applied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by
importance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores,
were then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the
extraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification
accuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for
operational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the
arrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in
directional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO
performance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway
for operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to
enable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying
operational conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型未充分利用医学概念间的语义关系，限制预测性能。

Method: 利用Poincaré嵌入将医学层级结构映射到超球空间，结合ResNet和Transformer模型，评估预测性能。

Result: 预训练的超球空间嵌入在增加模型识别能力和校准方面表现优异，尤其是ResNet表现出较好的校准性能。

Conclusion: 将临床知识图嵌入超球空间并整合到深度学习模型中，能有效利用医学层级结构，改善肺癌发病预测，提供结合数据驱动与临床知识的方法途径。

Abstract: Background: Existing clinical prediction models often represent patient data
using features that ignore the semantic relationships between clinical
concepts. This study integrates domain-specific semantic information by mapping
the SNOMED medical term hierarchy into a low-dimensional hyperbolic space using
Poincar\'e embeddings, with the aim of improving lung cancer onset prediction.
  Methods: Using a retrospective cohort from the Optum EHR dataset, we derived
a clinical knowledge graph from the SNOMED taxonomy and generated Poincar\'e
embeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. These embeddings were
then incorporated into two deep learning architectures, a ResNet and a
Transformer model. Models were evaluated for discrimination (area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration (average absolute
difference between observed and predicted probabilities) performance.
  Results: Incorporating pre-trained Poincar\'e embeddings resulted in modest
and consistent improvements in discrimination performance compared to baseline
models using randomly initialized Euclidean embeddings. ResNet models,
particularly those using a 10-dimensional Poincar\'e embedding, showed enhanced
calibration, whereas Transformer models maintained stable calibration across
configurations.
  Discussion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space and
integrating these representations into deep learning models can improve lung
cancer onset prediction by preserving the hierarchical structure of clinical
terminologies used for prediction. This approach demonstrates a feasible method
for combining data-driven feature extraction with established clinical
knowledge.

Conclusion: Diff-In提供了一种高效、准确的样本影响估计工具，有助于提升大规模数据分析和模型训练的质量。

Abstract: Data plays a pivotal role in the groundbreaking advancements in artificial
intelligence. The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to
model training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.
However, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many
of these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.
These limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.
In this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's
influence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive
learning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the
sample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across
successive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we
approximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the
need for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a
second-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to
that of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved
by computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently
approximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the
approximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower
approximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive
experiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset
selection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale
vision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data
points and outperforms strong baselines.

Result: 在多个数据集和三种GNN结构上，显著提升公平性指标，同时保持预测性能。

Conclusion: Fair-ICD有效改善GNN偏差问题，兼顾公平性和准确性，具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in modeling
graph-structured data. However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs
can exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender.
Moreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and
message-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias
by filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge
dropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may
unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised
balance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we
present a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias
mitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using
counterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node
representations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial
discriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN
classifiers. Our proposed technique, Fair-ICD, ensures the fairness of GNNs
under moderate conditions. Experiments on standard datasets using three GNN
backbones demonstrate that Fair-ICD notably enhances fairness metrics while
preserving high predictive performance.

Abstract: In the real world, anomalous entities often add more legitimate connections
while hiding direct links with other anomalous entities, leading to
heterophilic structures in anomalous networks that most GNN-based techniques
fail to address. Several works have been proposed to tackle this issue in the
spatial domain. However, these methods overlook the complex relationships
between node structure encoding, node features, and their contextual
environment and rely on principled guidance, research on solving spectral
domain heterophilic problems remains limited. This study analyzes the spectral
distribution of nodes with different heterophilic degrees and discovers that
the heterophily of anomalous nodes causes the spectral energy to shift from low
to high frequencies. To address the above challenges, we propose a spectral
neural network CES2-GAD based on causal edge separation for anomaly detection
on heterophilic graphs. Firstly, CES2-GAD will separate the original graph into
homophilic and heterophilic edges using causal interventions. Subsequently,
various hybrid-spectrum filters are used to capture signals from the segmented
graphs. Finally, representations from multiple signals are concatenated and
input into a classifier to predict anomalies. Extensive experiments with
real-world datasets have proven the effectiveness of the method we proposed.

Conclusion: HERAKLES展现出在复杂和不断变化目标空间中持续学习与适应的潜力，推动自主学习代理的发展。

Abstract: Open-ended AI agents need to be able to learn efficiently goals of increasing
complexity, abstraction and heterogeneity over their lifetime. Beyond sampling
efficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to
keep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated
growth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent
approaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and
language, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization
capabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing
approaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a
hierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such
designs are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally
diversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a
framework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously
compile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast
neural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the
high-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the
high-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and
generalization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We
evaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales
effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill
compilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over
time.

methods employ complex selective knowledge-sharing strategies that require
clients to identify in-distribution proxy data through computationally
expensive statistical density ratio estimators. Additionally, server-side
filtering of ambiguous knowledge introduces latency to the process. To address
these challenges, we propose a robust, resource-efficient EdgeFD method that
reduces the complexity of the client-side density ratio estimation and removes
the need for server-side filtering. EdgeFD introduces an efficient KMeans-based
density ratio estimator for effectively filtering both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution proxy data on clients, significantly improving the quality
of knowledge sharing. We evaluate EdgeFD across diverse practical scenarios,
including strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID data distributions on clients,
without requiring a pre-trained teacher model on the server for knowledge
distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeFD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving accuracy levels close to IID
scenarios even under heterogeneous and challenging conditions. The
significantly reduced computational overhead of the KMeans-based estimator is
suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, thereby enhancing
the scalability and real-world applicability of federated distillation. The
code is available online for reproducibility.

Conclusion: “情境引导”方法有效提升压缩距离在特定任务中的表现，推动其应用向主动定制方向发展。

Abstract: Compression-based distances (CD) offer a flexible and domain-agnostic means
of measuring similarity by identifying implicit information through
redundancies between data objects. However, as similarity features are derived
from the data, rather than defined as an input, it often proves difficult to
align with the task at hand, particularly in complex clustering or
classification settings. To address this issue, we introduce "context
steering," a novel methodology that actively guides the feature-shaping
process. Instead of passively accepting the emergent data structure (typically
a hierarchy derived from clustering CDs), our approach "steers" the process by
systematically analyzing how each object influences the relational context
within a clustering framework. This process generates a custom-tailored
embedding that isolates and amplifies class-distinctive information. We
validate the capabilities of this strategy using Normalized Compression
Distance (NCD) and Relative Compression Distance (NRC) with common hierarchical
clustering, providing an effective alternative to common transductive methods.
Experimental results across heterogeneous datasets-from text to real-world
audio-validate the robustness and generality of context steering, marking a
fundamental shift in their application: from merely discovering inherent data
structures to actively shaping a feature space tailored to a specific
objective.

Abstract: Model distillation enables the transfer of knowledge from large-scale models
to compact student models, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained
environments. However, conventional distillation approaches often suffer from
computational overhead and limited generalization. We propose a novel adaptive
distillation framework that dynamically augments training data in regions of
high student model loss. Using UMAP-based dimensionality reduction and nearest
neighbor sampling, our method identifies underperforming regions in the
embedding space and generates targeted synthetic examples to guide student
learning. To further improve efficiency, we introduce a lightweight
teacher-student interface that bypasses the teacher's input layer, enabling
direct distillation on vectorized representations. Experiments across standard
NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our 66M-parameter student model consistently
matches or surpasses established baselines, achieving 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3%
on SST-2, while training with fewer epochs. These results highlight the promise
of loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation for efficient and
effective model compression.

Abstract: Despite the high demand for manually annotated image data, managing complex
and costly annotation projects remains under-discussed. This is partly due to
the fact that leading such projects requires dealing with a set of diverse and
interconnected challenges which often fall outside the expertise of specific
domain experts, leaving practical guidelines scarce. These challenges range
widely from data collection to resource allocation and recruitment, from
mitigation of biases to effective training of the annotators. This paper
provides a domain-agnostic preparation guide for annotation projects, with a
focus on scientific imagery. Drawing from the authors' extensive experience in
managing a large manual annotation project, it addresses fundamental concepts
including success measures, annotation subjects, project goals, data
availability, and essential team roles. Additionally, it discusses various
human biases and recommends tools and technologies to improve annotation
quality and efficiency. The goal is to encourage further research and
frameworks for creating a comprehensive knowledge base to reduce the costs of
manual annotation projects across various fields.

Abstract: Guidance of generative models is typically achieved by modifying the
probability flow vector field through the addition of a guidance field. In this
paper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework,
which modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained
vector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined
problem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that
SGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide
bounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an
approximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field.
The key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose
the sampling method depending on their specific problem. To illustrate this, we
systematically compare different sampling methods and discuss conditions for
asymptotically exact guidance. Moreover, our framework integrates well with
optimal flow matching models since the straight transport map generated by the
vector field is preserved. Experimental results on synthetic 2D benchmarks,
image datasets, and physics-informed generative tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Link prediction is one of the most fundamental tasks in graph mining, which
motivates the recent studies of leveraging contrastive learning to enhance the
performance. However, we observe two major weaknesses of these studies: i) the
lack of theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, and
ii) inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning. To
address the above weaknesses, we provide the first formal theoretical analysis
for contrastive learning on link prediction, where our analysis results can
generalize to the autoencoder-based link prediction models with contrastive
learning. Motivated by our analysis results, we propose a new graph
augmentation approach, Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA), which adjusts the
node degrees in the graph as the augmentation. We then propose a new approach,
named Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA),
that integrates the proposed EBA and the proposed new contrastive losses to
improve the model performance. We conduct experiments on 8 benchmark datasets.
The results demonstrate that our proposed CoEBA significantly outperforms the
other state-of-the-art link prediction models.

Motivation: 解决连续折半算法中对中间性能值依赖过强的问题，避免早期淘汰潜在优秀的候选方案。

Method: 引入基于潜在克罗内克高斯过程的学习曲线预测模型，作为指导连续折半资源分配的辅助工具。

Result: 在大规模实证研究中，预测方法表现具有竞争力，但因需完整学习曲线数据，未能在资源利用效率上超越标准方法。

Conclusion: 利用已有学习曲线数据可以缓解预测模型的资源需求，未来可能提升方法的效率和实用性。

Abstract: Successive Halving is a popular algorithm for hyperparameter optimization
which allocates exponentially more resources to promising candidates. However,
the algorithm typically relies on intermediate performance values to make
resource allocation decisions, which can cause it to prematurely prune slow
starters that would eventually become the best candidate. We investigate
whether guiding Successive Halving with learning curve predictions based on
Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes can overcome this limitation. In a
large-scale empirical study involving different neural network architectures
and a click prediction dataset, we compare this predictive approach to the
standard approach based on current performance values. Our experiments show
that, although the predictive approach achieves competitive performance, it is
not Pareto optimal compared to investing more resources into the standard
approach, because it requires fully observed learning curves as training data.
However, this downside could be mitigated by leveraging existing learning curve
data.

Conclusion: 提出了数据无关的神经网络权重融合新框架，提供了理论基础和实践策略，推动神经网络模型的集成和泛化研究。

Abstract: What does it even mean to average neural networks? We investigate the problem
of synthesizing a single neural network from a collection of pretrained models,
each trained on disjoint data shards, using only their final weights and no
access to training data. In forming a definition of neural averaging, we take
insight from model soup, which appears to aggregate multiple models into a
singular model while enhancing generalization performance. In this work, we
reinterpret model souping as a special case of a broader framework: Amortized
Model Ensembling (AME) for neural averaging, a data-free meta-optimization
approach that treats model differences as pseudogradients to guide neural
weight updates. We show that this perspective not only recovers model soup but
enables more expressive and adaptive ensembling strategies. Empirically, AME
produces averaged neural solutions that outperform both individual experts and
model soup baselines, especially in out-of-distribution settings. Our results
suggest a principled and generalizable notion of data-free model weight
aggregation and defines, in one sense, how to perform neural averaging.

Transformer (QVT) backbone equipped with modality-specific encoders and a
unified cross-attention fusion module. By integrating graph features and
spatial patterns, our method captures key stereoelectronic interactions behind

achieves a top-1 accuracy of 85.1%, outperforming sequence-only baselines by a
substantial margin and achieving better performance results compared to other

Result: 实现对多个主流LLMs的高成功率攻击，提升速度，且具有良好的迁移能力。

Conclusion: 所提方法在对抗攻击中表现优越，为保护和增强LLMs安全提供了新的思路。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, ensuring their robustness and safety alignment remains a major
challenge. Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers
appended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on
inefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of
continuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to
selected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary
models. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete
tokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness.
We propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed
one-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient
descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot
encoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We
provide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement
an efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs.
Our method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to
three state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four
adversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In
addition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial
suffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of
optimized suffixes to different LLMs.

Conclusion: 数据感知的噪声优化方案能带来更稳健的生成性能，无需改变模型结构，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding
structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states
redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we
introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically
along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing
enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling
noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning
important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg
diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse
scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales
only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64,
mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis -
consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier
toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise
shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.

Abstract: As models grow larger and training them becomes expensive, it becomes
increasingly important to scale training recipes not just to larger models and
more data, but to do so in a compute-optimal manner that extracts maximal
performance per unit of compute. While such scaling has been well studied for
language modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in
this regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online,
value-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute
allocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed
compute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes
to maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between
model size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we
call TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for
small models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use
of large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this
phenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize
compute usage. Our findings provide a grounded starting point for
compute-optimal scaling in deep RL, mirroring studies in supervised learning
but adapted to TD learning.
