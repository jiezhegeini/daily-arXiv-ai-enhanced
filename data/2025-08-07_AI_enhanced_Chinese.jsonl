Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of\nreasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to\nenhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability.

To address these issues, we propose\nCX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved \"think-answer\"\nreasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and\nverifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an\ninstruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148\nsamples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points\nsupervised by clinical reports. Optimization was conducted in two stages under\nthe Group Relative Policy Optimization framework: initially stabilizing basic\nreasoning with closed-domain tasks, followed by transfer to open-domain\ndiagnostics, incorporating rule-based conditional process rewards to bypass the\nneed for pretrained reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate\nthat CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing medical and general-domain\nMLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment,\nachieving an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable\nCXR-specific models.

The Cases of Caste and Religion", "comment": "Accepted to AIES 2025", "summary": "Representational bias in large language models (LLMs) has predominantly been\nmeasured through single-response interactions and has focused on Global\nNorth-centric identities like race and gender. We expand on that research by\nconducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded\nrepresentational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of\nidentity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about\nsignificant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to\nencourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious\nand caste representation in the outputs against the actual population\ndistribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and\n\"stickiness\" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We\nfind that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups\nfar beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to\nencourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that\nrepresentational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased\nthan the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated\nprompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these\nbiases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be\nsufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental\nchanges in model development.

Despite its\neffectiveness, this study uncovers that LLM empowered recommender systems are\nvulnerable to reconstruction attacks that can expose both system and user\nprivacy. To examine this threat, we present the first systematic study on\ninversion attacks targeting LLM empowered recommender systems, where\nadversaries attempt to reconstruct original prompts that contain personal\npreferences, interaction histories, and demographic attributes by exploiting\nthe output logits of recommendation models. We reproduce the vec2text framework\nand optimize it using our proposed method called Similarity Guided Refinement,\nenabling more accurate reconstruction of textual prompts from model generated\nlogits. Extensive experiments across two domains (movies and books) and two\nrepresentative LLM based recommendation models demonstrate that our method\nachieves high fidelity reconstructions.

To address\nthis gap in accessibility, this paper presents a novel AI-powered agricultural\nchatbot, Krishi Sathi, designed to support Indian farmers by providing\npersonalized, easy-to-understand answers to their queries through both text and\nspeech. The system's intelligence stems from an IFT model, subsequently refined\nthrough fine-tuning on Indian agricultural knowledge across three curated\ndatasets. Unlike traditional chatbots that respond to one-off questions, Krishi\nSathi follows a structured, multi-turn conversation flow to gradually collect\nthe necessary details from the farmer, ensuring the query is fully understood\nbefore generating a response. Once the intent and context are extracted, the\nsystem performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by first fetching\ninformation from a curated agricultural database and then generating a tailored\nresponse using the IFT model.

Motivated by the hierarchical decomposition strategy in EM solvers\nand the inherent sparsity of local EM coupling, the U-PINet models the\ndecomposition and coupling of near- and far-field interactions through a\nmultiscale processing neural network architecture, while employing a\nphysics-inspired sparse graph representation to efficiently model both self-\nand mutual- coupling among mesh elements of complex $3$-Dimensional (3D)\nobjects. This principled approach enables end-to-end multiscale EM scattering\nmodeling with improved efficiency, generalization, and physical consistency.\nExperimental results showcase that the U-PINet accurately predicts surface\ncurrent distributions, achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while\nsignificantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep\nlearning baselines in both accuracy and robustness.

Through message passing on this graph, embeddings\nof users with rich search data are propagated to enhance the embeddings of\nusers with sparse interactions.

To address this issue, watermarking techniques\nhave emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages\ninto generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent\nefforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich\ninformation such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the\nfundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure\nreliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token\nsets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated\ncontent. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that\nimproves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects\npreferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a\nlarger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that\nrely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a\nclustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even\nwhen the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and\ndecoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the\nmessage into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically\ndecode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text\nand improving decoding accuracy.

Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains\nchallenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a\ncomplex hierarchically structured label taxonomy. Accurate classification of\nsoil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts\nagricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate\nresilience. In this work, we propose $\\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal\nmultitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized\npipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first\npredict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates.\nEach segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological\nfeatures. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal\nconcatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to\naccount for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons. Our\nmethod is designed to address complex hierarchical classification, where the\nnumber of possible labels is very large, imbalanced and non-trivially\nstructured.

Intuitively, it has been established that the most recent\ninteractions are more indicative of future preferences than older interactions.\nMany recommendation algorithms use this notion to either drop older\ninteractions or to assign them a lower weight, so the model can focus on the\nmore informative, recent information.

However, their inherent dependence\non static parametric memory fundamentally limits their adaptability, factual\naccuracy, and interpretability in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Knowledge\ngraphs (KGs), as structured repositories of explicit relational knowledge,\noffer a promising approach for augmenting LLMs with external, interpretable\nmemory. Nevertheless, most existing methods that combine LLMs with KGs treat\nreasoning and knowledge updating as separate processes, resulting in suboptimal\nutilization of new information and hindering real-time updates. In this work,\nwe propose TRAIL: a novel, unified framework for Thinking, Reasoning, And\nIncremental Learning that couples joint inference and dynamic KG refinement\nwith large language models.

Consequently, an ideal facilitator must be\nsensitive to the subtle dynamics of disengagement, difficulties with individual\ngoal setting and execution, and interpersonal difficulties that signal a need\nfor intervention. The challenges and cognitive load experienced by facilitators\ncreate a critical gap for an embodied technology that can interpret social\nexchanges while remaining aware of the needs of the individuals in the group\nand providing transparent recommendations that go beyond powerful but \"black\nbox\" foundation models (FMs) that identify social cues. We address this\nimportant demand with a social robot co-facilitator that analyzes multimodal\nmeeting data and provides discreet cues to the facilitator. The robot's\nreasoning is powered by an agentic concept bottleneck model (CBM), which makes\ndecisions based on human-interpretable concepts like participant engagement and\nsentiments, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. Our core contribution is\na transfer learning framework that distills the broad social understanding of\nan FM into our specialized and transparent CBM. This concept-driven system\nsignificantly outperforms direct zero-shot FMs in predicting the need for\nintervention and enables real-time human correction of its reasoning.\nCritically, we demonstrate robust knowledge transfer: the model generalizes\nacross different groups and successfully transfers the expertise of senior\nhuman facilitators to improve the performance of novices.

To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a\nmulti-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and\nobjective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard\nfeatures a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental\ncapabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent\nwithin HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured\nsecurity policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously\nupdating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective\nOptimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility\nAgent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning\nto evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their\noptimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that\nHarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up\nto 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance\nacross all tasks.

Recently, generative recommendation\nhas emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional\nretrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic\ngeneration. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained\nby their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from\ntwo critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking\na coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement\n(i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that\nlearns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core\ninnovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization\nprocess that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more\nuniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict\nhierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for\neach recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE\nincorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space\noverlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but\nalso promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive\nutilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled\nIDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models.

To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative\nReasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from\nprobability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking \"Which\nanswer is most likely?\", DRN asks \"Which hypothesis has the most internally\nconsistent evidence?\". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly\ntracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing\nhypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our\napproach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative\nmodel that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a\nlightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs.\nEvaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to\nexpose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over\nstandard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with\nMistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most\nchallenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot\ngeneralization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional\ntraining, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable\nreasoning principles.

Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of\ntransfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets\nand find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail\noff as more target points are selected for inclusion in training. This tail-off\nin performance may indicate that the active learning process is doing a good\njob of sequencing data points for selection, pushing the less useful points\ntowards the end of the selection process and that this tail-off occurs when\nthese less useful points are eventually added.

We propose a combined manifold and machine\nlearning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent\ncrowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The\nproposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation\nEquation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and\nmultiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the\nmass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first\nstep, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete\nmicroscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based\non manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space\ninto the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the\ncorresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning\nreduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning\ntechniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the\ncrowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density\nprofiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density\ndistribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this \"embed->learn in latent\nspace->lift back to the ambient space\" pipeline, we create an effective\nsolution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution.\nFor our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a\ncorridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions.

However,\ncurrent RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently\nretrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be\nresolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk\nretrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information\nsignals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive\nInformation Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that\nintegrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether\nto retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs\na dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer\nand a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these\noutputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically\nimproving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a\ndual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and\nself-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information\nSelection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to\nboth sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance\nefficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy\nthrough contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.\nExperimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS\nreduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)\nwhile still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior\nbaselines on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6PAIRS\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u7a00\u758f\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5224\u65ad\u662f\u5426\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6587\u6863\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u7b5b\u9009\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u7d22\u6210\u672c\uff08\u7ea625%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53471.1%\u7684EM\u548c1.0%\u7684F1\u3002", "conclusion": "PAIRS\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347RAG\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The model is evaluated across various scenarios, including: (1)\nRayleigh-Plesset equation based bubble dynamics with a single initial radius,\n(2) Keller-Miksis equation based bubble dynamics with a single initial radius,\nand (3) Keller-Miksis equation based bubble dynamics with multiple initial\nradii. Moreover, the performance of single-step versus two-step training\ntechniques for BubbleONet is investigated. The results demonstrate that\nBubbleONet serves as a promising surrogate model for simulating bubble\ndynamics, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional\nnumerical solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u7b97\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6c14\u6ce1\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5BubbleONet\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u89e3\u7b97\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6c14\u6ce1\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8ePI-DeepONet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u52a0\u5165Rowdy\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5355\u6b65\u548c\u53cc\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6c14\u6ce1\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "BubbleONet\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u7528\u4e8e\u6c14\u6ce1\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This leads to\nexcessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical\ndeployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory\nmechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their\nreasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To\naddress this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),\nwhich explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and\ncontrol components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control\nstrategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction\nmechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and\ndelegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling\nthe construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a\nstructured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised\nfine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial\nmeta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment\nPolicy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control\nbehavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.\nExperiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained\nwith MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMERA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LRMs\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53d7\u63a7\u3001\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d6a\u8d39\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u8026\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528auxiliary LLMs\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528CSPO\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9879\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MERA\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In\nparticular, our experimental results display that in certain test cases, the\nmodel outperforms its classical counterpart in terms of both training and test\nloss, while in the remaining cases, it achieves comparable performance. A key\nadvantage of our approach lies in its foundation on a variational quantum\nalgorithm, enabling implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum\n(NISQ) devices without strict requirements on the number of qubits or circuit\ndepth."}

To achieve this goal, we\ndesign a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a\nCurriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.\nThe agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of\nadversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist\ntraining strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from\nspecialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA\ncapable of continuous autonomous evolution.

Recently, the\nintroduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging\nrule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions\nand guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across\nmany replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses\nunder a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or\nincorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to\nvanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for\nlearning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.\nTo address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization\nframework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome\nconsistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs\nshow high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives\nmeaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and\nself-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we\nincorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances\nlocal advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic\ntransitions between exploration and convergence throughout training.

To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel method, Stochastic Alternating Minimization with Trainable Step Sizes\n(SAMT), which updates network parameters in an alternating manner by treating\nthe weights of each layer as a block. By decomposing the overall optimization\ninto sub-problems corresponding to different blocks, this block-wise\nalternating strategy reduces per-step computational overhead and enhances\ntraining stability in nonconvex settings. To fully leverage these benefits,\ninspired by meta-learning, we proposed a novel adaptive step size strategy to\nincorporate into the sub-problem solving steps of alternating updates.

We explore how the neural approach's\nreliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic\ncomputational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot\nbe analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of\nscaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,\nI demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly\nsensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My\ninvestigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss\nthresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of\nemergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent\nproperties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where\nsystemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple\ncomponents without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper\nconcludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a\nnew domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of\nemergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology.

Existing Private Inference (PI)\nmethods face a fundamental trade-off between privacy and efficiency:\ncryptographic approaches offer strong protection but incur high computational\noverhead, while efficient alternatives such as split inference expose\nintermediate features to inversion attacks. We propose PrivDFS, a new paradigm\nfor private inference that replaces a single exposed representation with\ndistributed feature sharing. PrivDFS partitions input features on the client\ninto multiple balanced shares, which are distributed to non-colluding,\nnon-communicating servers for independent partial inference. The client\nsecurely aggregates the servers' outputs to reconstruct the final prediction,\nensuring that no single server observes sufficient information to compromise\ninput privacy. To further strengthen privacy, we propose two key extensions:\nPrivDFS-AT, which uses adversarial training with a diffusion-based proxy\nattacker to enforce inversion-resistant feature partitioning, and PrivDFS-KD,\nwhich leverages user-specific keys to diversify partitioning policies and\nprevent query-based inversion generalization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and\nCelebA demonstrate that PrivDFS achieves privacy comparable to deep split\ninference while cutting client computation by up to 100 times with no accuracy\nloss, and that the extensions remain robust against both diffusion-based\nin-distribution and adaptive attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "PrivDFS\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u5171\u4eab\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u79c1\u6709\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e91\u7aefML\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u53c8\u5177\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u5212\u5206\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\u5206\u7247\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u7ed9\u4e0d\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u90e8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u518d\u6c47\u603b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5bc6\u94a5\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cCelebA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPrivDFS\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e14\u6269\u5c55\u4f9d\u7136\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "PrivDFS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u79c1\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u591a\u91cd\u4fdd\u62a4\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5728\u4e91\u7aefML\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002"}}

It\nhighlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) while acknowledging the\nsignificant challenges of ensuring factual accuracy and curriculum alignment,\nespecially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. This research\nintroduces and compares four incremental pipelines for generating Form 1\nMathematics multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Bahasa Melayu using OpenAI's\nGPT-4o. The methods range from non-grounded prompting (structured and basic) to\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches (one using the LangChain\nframework, one implemented manually). The system is grounded in official\ncurriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching\nplan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess\nthe generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic\nTextual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified\nthrough a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method.

However, there\nexists an inherent trade-off: imposing a distinctive style often degrades\ntruthfulness. Existing representation editing methods, by naively injecting\nstyle signals, overlook this collateral impact and frequently contaminate the\nmodel's core truthfulness representations, resulting in reduced answer\ncorrectness. We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse.\nWe attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions\nin certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that\npreserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates\nthe style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation\nspace via an orthogonal deflation process. This decomposition enables\nindependent control of style and truth in their own subspaces, minimizing\ninterference.

Freeman"], "title": "Hierarchical Scoring for Machine Learning Classifier Error Impact Evaluation", "comment": null, "summary": "A common use of machine learning (ML) models is predicting the class of a\nsample. Object detection is an extension of classification that includes\nlocalization of the object via a bounding box within the sample.\nClassification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by\ncounting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the\nground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as\nequivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy\nwith a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or\noperator valuation of misclassifications. When such a hierarchical structure\nexists, hierarchical scoring metrics can return the model performance of a\ngiven prediction related to the distance between the prediction and the ground\ntruth label. Such metrics can be viewed as giving partial credit to predictions\ninstead of pass/fail, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the impact of\nmisclassifications. This work develops hierarchical scoring metrics varying in\ncomplexity that utilize scoring trees to encode relationships between class\nlabels and produce metrics that reflect distance in the scoring tree. The\nscoring metrics are demonstrated on an abstract use case with scoring trees\nthat represent three weighting strategies and evaluated by the kind of errors\ndiscouraged.

However, continual fine-tuning\nLLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,\ncharacterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and\n2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously\naddress both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample\nReplay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient\nanti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices\nunder GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced\nactivation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin\n(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.\nWe are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general\nreplay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general\ncapabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.\nIndeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter.

However,\ntraffic data is typically distributed among multiple data owners, and privacy\nconstraints prevent the direct utilization of these isolated datasets for\ntraffic prediction. Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on\ndesigning communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information\nfrom other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such\napproaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting\ntransmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume\nof traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical,\nmaking the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for\nfederated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP).\nUnlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client\ncommunication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate\npredictions using only local information. Based on the CIP, we further develop\nFed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to\nprocess its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information\nloss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients. Fed-CI\nsignificantly reduces communication overhead, accelerates the training process,\nand achieves state-of-the-art performance while complying with privacy\nregulations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat Fed-CI consistently outperforms existing methods across all datasets and\nfederated settings.

We discover that graph structures provide more consistent\ncross-domain information compared to node features and graph labels. However,\ntraditional GFMs primarily focus on transferring node features from various\ndomains into a unified representation space but often lack structural\ncross-domain generalization. To address this, we introduce GraphProp, which\nemphasizes structural generalization. The training process of GraphProp\nconsists of two main phases. First, we train a structural GFM by predicting\ngraph invariants. Since graph invariants are properties of graphs that depend\nonly on the abstract structure, not on particular labellings or drawings of the\ngraph, this structural GFM has a strong ability to capture the abstract\nstructural information and provide discriminative graph representations\ncomparable across diverse domains.

Its measurement requires destructive testing, limiting the potential\nfor efficient quality control. Physics-informed neural networks were\ninvestigated as a promising tool to reconstruct internal process states from\nexperimental data, enabling model-based and non-invasive quality assessment in\naluminum spot welding. A major challenge is the integration of real-world data\ninto the network due to competing optimization objectives. To address this, we\nintroduce two novel training strategies. First, experimental losses for dynamic\ndisplacement and nugget diameter are progressively included using a fading-in\nfunction to prevent excessive optimization conflicts. We also implement a\ncustom learning rate scheduler and early stopping based on a rolling window to\ncounteract premature reduction due to increased loss magnitudes. Second, we\nintroduce a conditional update of temperature-dependent material parameters via\na look-up table, activated only after a loss threshold is reached to ensure\nphysically meaningful temperatures. An axially symmetric two-dimensional model\nwas selected to represent the welding process accurately while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency. To reduce computational burden, the training\nstrategies and model components were first systematically evaluated in one\ndimension, enabling controlled analysis of loss design and contact models.

While existing methods often fail to capture the underlying\nmechanisms behind anomaly generation in time series data. In addition, time\nseries anomaly detection often faces several data-related inherent challenges,\ni.e., label scarcity, data imbalance, and complex multi-periodicity. In this\npaper, we leverage causal tools and introduce a new causality-based framework,\nCaPulse, which tunes in to the underlying causal pulse of time series data to\neffectively detect anomalies.

While\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced LP performance\nrecently, existing methods face key challenges including limited supervision\nfrom sparse connectivity, sensitivity to initialization, and poor\ngeneralization under distribution shifts. We explore pretraining as a solution\nto address these challenges. Unlike node classification, LP is inherently a\npairwise task, which requires the integration of both node- and edge-level\ninformation. In this work, we present the first systematic study on the\ntransferability of these distinct modules and propose a late fusion strategy to\neffectively combine their outputs for improved performance. To handle the\ndiversity of pretraining data and avoid negative transfer, we introduce a\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that captures distinct patterns in separate\nexperts, facilitating seamless application of the pretrained model on diverse\ndownstream datasets. For fast adaptation, we develop a parameter-efficient\ntuning strategy that allows the pretrained model to adapt to unseen datasets\nwith minimal computational overhead.
