However, these methods rely on\nfragile, implicit mechanisms often yielding inconsistent outputs across seeds,\nformats, or minor prompt variations making them fundamentally unreliable for\ntasks requiring stable, interpretable reasoning. In contrast, automata-based\nneuro-symbolic frameworks like RetoMaton offer a more structured and\ntrustworthy alternative by grounding retrieval in symbolic memory with\ndeterministic transitions. In this work, we extend RetoMaton by replacing its\nglobal datastore with a local, task-adaptive Weighted Finite Automaton (WFA),\nconstructed directly from external domain corpora. This local automaton\nstructure promotes robust, context-aware retrieval while preserving symbolic\ntraceability and low inference overhead. Unlike prompting, which entangles\ncontext and memory in opaque ways, our approach leverages the explicit\nstructure of WFAs to provide verifiable and modular retrieval behavior, making\nit better suited for domain transfer and interoperability.

In VA, interviewers ask proximal informants for details on the\ncircumstances preceding a death, in the form of unstructured narratives and\nstructured questions. Existing automated VA cause classification algorithms\nonly use the questions and ignore the information in the narratives. In this\nthesis, we investigate how the VA narrative can be used for automated COD\nclassification using pretrained language models (PLMs) and machine learning\n(ML) techniques. Using empirical data from South Africa, we demonstrate that\nwith the narrative alone, transformer-based PLMs with task-specific fine-tuning\noutperform leading question-only algorithms at both the individual and\npopulation levels, particularly in identifying non-communicable diseases. We\nexplore various multimodal fusion strategies combining narratives and questions\nin unified frameworks. Multimodal approaches further improve performance in COD\nclassification, confirming that each modality has unique contributions and may\ncapture valuable information that is not present in the other modality. We also\ncharacterize physician-perceived information sufficiency in VA. We describe\nvariations in sufficiency levels by age and COD and demonstrate that\nclassification accuracy is affected by sufficiency for both physicians and\nmodels. Overall, this thesis advances the growing body of knowledge at the\nintersection of natural language processing, epidemiology, and global health.\nIt demonstrates the value of narrative in enhancing COD classification.

Second, monitor scaffolding matters more than monitor\nawareness: the hybrid scaffolding consistently outperforms baseline monitor\nscaffolding, and can enable weaker models to reliably monitor stronger agents\n-- a weak-to-strong scaling effect. Third, in a human-in-the-loop setting where\nhumans discuss with the LLM monitor to get an updated judgment for the agent's\nbehavior, targeted human oversight is most effective; escalating only\npre-flagged cases to human reviewers improved the TPR by approximately 15% at\nFPR = 0.01.

This is due to the natural\ncoupling of recommender systems and federated learning architectures: the data\noriginates from distributed clients (mostly mobile devices held by users),\nwhich are highly related to privacy. In a centralized recommender system\n(CenRec), the central server collects clients' data, trains the model, and\nprovides the service. Whereas in federated recommender systems (FedRec), the\nstep of data collecting is omitted, and the step of model training is offloaded\nto each client. The server only aggregates the model and other knowledge, thus\navoiding client privacy leakage. Some surveys of federated recommender systems\ndiscuss and analyze related work from the perspective of designing FL systems.\nHowever, their utility drops by ignoring specific recommendation scenarios'\nunique characteristics and practical challenges. For example, the statistical\nheterogeneity issue in cross-domain FedRec originates from the label drift of\nthe data held by different platforms, which is mainly caused by the recommender\nitself, but not the federated architecture. Therefore, it should focus more on\nsolving specific problems in real-world recommendation scenarios to encourage\nthe deployment FedRec.

These agents engage in deliberation, legislation, and elections under\nvarious stressors, such as budget crises and resource scarcity. We present a\nnovel metric, the Power-Preservation Index (PPI), to quantify misaligned\nbehavior where agents prioritize their own power over public welfare. Our\nfindings demonstrate that institutional design, specifically the combination of\na Constitutional AI (CAI) charter and a mediated deliberation protocol, serves\nas a potent alignment mechanism. These structures significantly reduce corrupt\npower-seeking behavior, improve policy stability, and enhance citizen welfare\ncompared to less constrained democratic models.

Prior efforts have been made to improve\neither graph construction or graph retrieval in isolation, yielding suboptimal\nperformance, especially when domain shifts occur. In this paper, we propose a\nvertically unified agentic paradigm, Youtu-GraphRAG, to jointly connect the\nentire framework as an intricate integration. Specifically, (i) a seed graph\nschema is introduced to bound the automatic extraction agent with targeted\nentity types, relations and attribute types, also continuously expanded for\nscalability over unseen domains; (ii) To obtain higher-level knowledge upon the\nschema, we develop novel dually-perceived community detection, fusing\nstructural topology with subgraph semantics for comprehensive knowledge\norganization. This naturally yields a hierarchical knowledge tree that supports\nboth top-down filtering and bottom-up reasoning with community summaries; (iii)\nAn agentic retriever is designed to interpret the same graph schema to\ntransform complex queries into tractable and parallel sub-queries.

To tackle these problems, this paper introduces ReST-RL, a\nunified LLM RL paradigm that significantly improves LLM's code reasoning\nability by combining an improved GRPO algorithm with a meticulously designed\ntest time decoding method assisted by a value model (VM). As the first stage of\npolicy reinforcement, ReST-GRPO adopts an optimized ReST algorithm to filter\nand assemble high-value training data, increasing the reward variance of GRPO\nsampling, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of training. After\nthe basic reasoning ability of LLM policy has been improved, we further propose\na test time decoding optimization method called VM-MCTS. Through Monte-Carlo\nTree Search (MCTS), we collect accurate value targets with no annotation\nrequired, on which VM training is based. When decoding, the VM is deployed by\nan adapted MCTS algorithm to provide precise process signals as well as\nverification scores, assisting the LLM policy to achieve high reasoning\naccuracy.

While AF\ndetection algorithms perform well in identifying persistent AF, early-stage\nprogression, such as paroxysmal AF (PAF), often goes undetected due to its\nsudden onset and short duration. However, undetected PAF can progress into\nsustained AF, increasing the risk of mortality and severe complications. Early\nprediction of AF offers an opportunity to reduce disease progression through\npreventive therapies, such as catecholamine-sparing agents or beta-blockers. In\nthis study, we propose a lightweight deep learning model using only RR\nIntervals (RRIs), combining a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for\npositional encoding with Mamba, a selective state space model, to enable early\nprediction of AF through efficient parallel sequence modeling. In subject-wise\ntesting results, our model achieved a sensitivity of 0.908, specificity of\n0.933, F1-score of 0.930, AUROC of 0.972, and AUPRC of 0.932. Additionally, our\nmethod demonstrates high computational efficiency, with only 73.5 thousand\nparameters and 38.3 MFLOPs, outperforming traditional Convolutional Neural\nNetwork-Recurrent Neural Network (CNN-RNN) approaches in both accuracy and\nmodel compactness.

This approach offers a more\nmeaningful evaluation than conventional string-based metrics by aligning more\nclosely with the strategic and rule-governed nature of chess.

For very large plants, like semiconductor fabs, the problem\nbecomes unsolvable on a plant-wide scale in a reasonable amount of time using\nclassical linear optimization. An alternative approach is the use of swarm\nintelligence algorithms. These have been applied to the job-shop problem\nbefore, but often in a centrally calculated way where they are applied to the\nsolution space, but they can be implemented in a bottom-up fashion to avoid\nglobal result computation as well. One of the problems in semiconductor\nproduction is that the production process requires a lot of switching between\nmachines that process lots one after the other and machines that process\nbatches of lots at once, often with long processing times. In this paper, we\naddress this switching problem with the ``boids'' flocking algorithm that was\noriginally used in robotics and movie industry. The flocking behavior is a\nbio-inspired algorithm that uses only local information and interaction based\non simple heuristics.

SAE analysis\nreveals the mechanism: format representations separate (10% feature overlap at\nLayer 7), then re-entangle with different weightings (80% feature overlap at\nLayer 10), with specific features showing 1.5x amplification in failing\nformats. We achieve perfect repair using only 25% of attention heads and\nidentify a 60% pattern replacement threshold, demonstrating that apparent\nfull-module requirements hide sophisticated substructure with implications for\ninterpretability and efficiency.

By incorporating transient\nmultiphase flow physics into the training process, our method enables more\npractical and accurate predictions for realistic injection-extraction scenarios\ncompare to previous works. To speed up training, we pretrain the model on\nsingle-phase, steady-state simulations and then fine-tune it on full multiphase\nscenarios, which dramatically reduces the computational cost. We demonstrate\nthat high-accuracy training can be achieved with fewer than three thousand\nfull-physics multiphase flow simulations -- compared to previous estimates\nrequiring up to ten million.

In this study, we introduce a novel unsupervised contrastive\nlearning framework to cluster 43 cancer types based on coding mutation data\nderived from the COSMIC database.

In this work we study how much information the\nattacker needs for membership inference by investigating the sample\ncomplexity-the minimum number of reference samples required-for a successful\nattack. We study this question in the fundamental setting of Gaussian mean\nestimation where the learning algorithm is given $n$ samples from a Gaussian\ndistribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\Sigma)$ in $d$ dimensions, and tries to estimate\n$\\hat\\mu$ up to some error $\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\hat \\mu - \\mu\\|^2_{\\Sigma}]\\leq\n\\rho^2 d$.

Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves continuous and precise control over\nLLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge, enabling both increased sensitivity\nand reduced sensitivity, thereby allowing LLMs to prioritize either contextual\nor parametric knowledge as needed flexibly.

In particular, LLMs are\nincreasingly used as a plug-and-play method for fitting data and generating\npredictions. Prior work has shown that LLMs, via in-context learning or\nsupervised fine-tuning, can perform competitively with many tabular supervised\nlearning techniques in terms of predictive performance. However, we identify a\ncritical vulnerability of using LLMs for data fitting -- making changes to data\nrepresentation that are completely irrelevant to the underlying learning task\ncan drastically alter LLMs' predictions on the same data. For example, simply\nchanging variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82%\nin certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to\ntask-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and\nsupervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose\nLLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we\ndiscover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable\nnames/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive\nmore attention when output tokens are generated, even though different\npositions are expected to receive roughly the same attention.

We also developed a lightweight,\nstable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling\noptimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8\nhours. Experimental results show that Spotlight Attention drastically improves\nretrieval precision while shortening the length of the hash code at least\n5$\\times$ compared to traditional linear hashing. Finally, we exploit the\ncomputational advantages of bitwise operations by implementing specialized CUDA\nkernels, achieving hashing retrieval for 512K tokens in under 100$\\mu$s on a\nsingle A100 GPU, with end-to-end throughput up to 3$\\times$ higher than vanilla\ndecoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSpotlight Attention\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u54c8\u5e0c\u4f18\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u952e\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u503c\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u503c(KV)\u7f13\u5b58\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u54c8\u5e0c\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eBradley-Terry\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728GPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548CUDA\u6838\u6765\u52a0\u5feb\u54c8\u5e0c\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u54c8\u5e0c\u7801\u957f\u5ea6\u81f3\u5c115\u500d\uff0c512K tokens\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u65f6\u95f4\u5728100\u5fae\u79d2\u5185\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u89e3\u7801\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u81f3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76843\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "Spotlight Attention\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u54c8\u5e0c\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578bKV\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

However, most DNN-based methods suffer from catastrophic\nforgetting and fail to maintain their performance in previously learned\nscenarios after adapting to new data. Recent continual learning (CL) studies\naim to mitigate this phenomenon by enhancing memory stability of DNN, i.e., the\nability to retain learned knowledge. Yet, excessive emphasis on the memory\nstability often impairs learning plasticity, i.e., the capacity of DNN to\nacquire new information effectively. To address such stability-plasticity\ndilemma, this study proposes a novel CL method, synergetic memory rehearsal\n(SyReM), for DNN-based motion forecasting. SyReM maintains a compact memory\nbuffer to represent learned knowledge. To ensure memory stability, it employs\nan inequality constraint that limits increments in the average loss over the\nmemory buffer. Synergistically, a selective memory rehearsal mechanism is\ndesigned to enhance learning plasticity by selecting samples from the memory\nbuffer that are most similar to recently observed data. This selection is based\non an online-measured cosine similarity of loss gradients, ensuring targeted\nmemory rehearsal. Since replayed samples originate from learned scenarios, this\nmemory rehearsal mechanism avoids compromising memory stability. We validate\nSyReM under an online CL paradigm where training samples from diverse scenarios\narrive as a one-pass stream. Experiments on 11 naturalistic driving datasets\nfrom INTERACTION demonstrate that, compared to non-CL and CL baselines, SyReM\nsignificantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting in past scenarios while\nimproving forecasting accuracy in new ones.

This allows ALSA to provide robust and accurate\nperformance estimates across a wide range of distribution shifts.

Personalized federated learning (pFL) has\ngained increasing attention for its ability to address data heterogeneity.\nHowever, most existing pFL methods assume that each client's data follows a\nsingle distribution and learn one client-level personalized model for each\nclient. This assumption often fails in practice, where a single client may\npossess data from multiple sources or domains, resulting in significant\nintra-client heterogeneity and suboptimal performance. To tackle this\nchallenge, we propose pFedBayesPT, a fine-grained instance-wise pFL framework\nbased on visual prompt tuning.

However, their inference remains slower than that of\nautoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and\nthe large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this\nwork, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer\nconvergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by\nhalf steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and\nrandom remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99%\nof instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the\nrefinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a\ntraining-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding.\nSpecifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to\ngo \"all-in\" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the\nconfidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It\nintegrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible\noverhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of\nLLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the\nnumber of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation\nquality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop\nsampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet\npowerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing\nspeedup techniques.

However, current compositional benchmarks testing these skills\ntend to focus on either commonsense or math reasoning, whereas LLM agents\nsolving real-world tasks would require a combination of both. In this work, we\nintroduce an Agentic Commonsense and Math benchmark (AgentCoMa), where each\ncompositional task requires a commonsense reasoning step and a math reasoning\nstep. We test it on 61 LLMs of different sizes, model families, and training\nstrategies. We find that LLMs can usually solve both steps in isolation, yet\ntheir accuracy drops by ~30% on average when the two are combined.

Though simple latent\ndistributions are commonly used, it has been shown that more sophisticated\ndistributions can improve performance. For instance, recent work has explored\nusing the distributions produced by quantum processors and found empirical\nimprovements. However, when latent space distributions produced by quantum\nprocessors can be expected to improve performance, and whether these\nimprovements are reproducible, are open questions that we investigate in this\nwork. We prove that, under certain conditions, these \"quantum latent\ndistributions\" enable generative models to produce data distributions that\nclassical latent distributions cannot efficiently produce. We also provide\nactionable intuitions to identify when such quantum advantages may arise in\nreal-world settings. We perform benchmarking experiments on both a synthetic\nquantum dataset and the QM9 molecular dataset, using both simulated and real\nphotonic quantum processors. Our results demonstrate that quantum latent\ndistributions can lead to improved generative performance in GANs compared to a\nrange of classical baselines.

However, mainstream approaches\ngenerally rely on a large number of trainable parameters and fixed aggregation\nrules, making it difficult to adapt to graph data with strong structural\nheterogeneity and complex feature distributions. This often leads to\nover-smoothing of node representations and semantic degradation. To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes a parameter-free graph neural network\nframework based on structural diversity, namely SDGNN (Structural-Diversity\nGraph Neural Network). The framework is inspired by structural diversity theory\nand designs a unified structural-diversity message passing mechanism that\nsimultaneously captures the heterogeneity of neighborhood structures and the\nstability of feature semantics, without introducing additional trainable\nparameters. Unlike traditional parameterized methods, SDGNN does not rely on\ncomplex model training, but instead leverages complementary modeling from both\nstructure-driven and feature-driven perspectives, thereby effectively improving\nadaptability across datasets and scenarios. Experimental results show that on\neight public benchmark datasets and an interdisciplinary PubMed citation\nnetwork, SDGNN consistently outperforms mainstream GNNs under challenging\nconditions such as low supervision, class imbalance, and cross-domain transfer.\nThis work provides a new theoretical perspective and general approach for the\ndesign of parameter-free graph neural networks, and further validates the\nimportance of structural diversity as a core signal in graph representation\nlearning.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose NM-Hebb, a two-phase training framework that integrates\nneuro-inspired local plasticity with distance-aware supervision. Phase 1\nextends standard supervised training by jointly optimising a cross-entropy\nobjective with two biologically inspired mechanisms: (i) a Hebbian regulariser\nthat aligns the spatial mean of activations with the mean of the corresponding\nconvolutional filter weights, encouraging structured, reusable primitives; and\n(ii) a learnable neuromodulator that gates an elastic-weight-style\nconsolidation loss, preserving beneficial parameters without freezing the\nnetwork. Phase 2 fine-tunes the backbone with a pairwise metric-learning loss,\nexplicitly compressing intra-class distances and enlarging inter-class margins\nin the embedding space. Evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet\nacross five backbones (ResNet-18, VGG-11, MobileNet-v2, EfficientNet-V2,\nDenseNet-121), NM-Hebb achieves consistent gains over baseline and other\nmethods: Top-1 accuracy improves by +2.0-10.0 pp (CIFAR-10), +2.0-9.0 pp\n(CIFAR-100), and up to +4.3-8.9 pp (TinyImageNet), with Normalised Mutual\nInformation (NMI) increased by up to +0.15. Qualitative visualisations and\nfilter-level analyses further confirm that NM-Hebb produces more structured and\nselective features, yielding tighter and more interpretable class clusters.\nOverall, coupling local Hebbian plasticity with metric-based fine-tuning yields\nCNNs that are not only more accurate but also more interpretable, offering\npractical benefits for resource-constrained and safety-critical AI deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6NM-Hebb\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347CNN\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u611f\u77e5\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3001\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3CNN\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7c7b\u522b\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8Hebbian\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u548c\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86CNN\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Paper accepted to CIKM 2025", "summary": "Given a signed bipartite graph (SBG) G with two disjoint node sets U and V,\nthe goal of link sign prediction is to predict the signs of potential links\nconnecting U and V based on known positive and negative edges in G. The\nmajority of existing solutions towards link sign prediction mainly focus on\nunipartite signed graphs, which are sub-optimal due to the neglect of node\nheterogeneity and unique bipartite characteristics of SBGs. To this end, recent\nstudies adapt graph neural networks to SBGs by introducing message-passing\nschemes for both inter-partition (UxV) and intra-partition (UxU or VxV) node\npairs. However, the fundamental spectral convolutional operators were\noriginally designed for positive links in unsigned graphs, and thus, are not\noptimal for inferring missing positive or negative links from known ones in\nSBGs.\n  Motivated by this, this paper proposes GegenNet, a novel and effective\nspectral convolutional neural network model for link sign prediction in SBGs.\nIn particular, GegenNet achieves enhanced model capacity and high predictive\naccuracy through three main technical contributions: (i) fast and theoretically\ngrounded spectral decomposition techniques for node feature initialization;\n(ii) a new spectral graph filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomial basis; and\n(iii) multi-layer sign-aware spectral convolutional networks alternating\nGegenbauer polynomial filters with positive and negative edges. Our extensive\nempirical studies reveal that GegenNet can achieve significantly superior\nperformance (up to a gain of 4.28% in AUC and 11.69% in F1) in link sign\nprediction compared to 11 strong competitors over 6 benchmark SBG datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "GegenNet\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\u53caGegenbauer\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u4e2d\u94fe\u8def\u7b26\u53f7\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u94fe\u8def\u7b26\u53f7\u9884\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u7b26\u53f7\u56fe\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u7279\u6b8a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGegenNet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\u3001Gegenbauer\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6ee4\u6ce2\u53ca\u591a\u5c42\u7b26\u53f7\u611f\u77e5\u5377\u79ef\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u53ca\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cGegenNet\u5728AUC\u548cF1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed611\u4e2a\u5f3a\u7ade\u4e89\u8005\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u6700\u591a4.28%\u548c11.69%\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "GegenNet\u901a\u8fc7\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7b26\u53f7\u94fe\u8def\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Most existing methods rely on\ncomparing high-dimensional text embeddings from models like CLIP or CXR-BERT,\nwhich are often difficult to interpret, computationally expensive, and not\nwell-aligned with the structured nature of medical knowledge. We propose a\nnovel, ontology-driven alternative for comparing radiology report texts based\non clinically grounded concepts from the Unified Medical Language System\n(UMLS). Our method extracts standardised medical entities from free-text\nreports using an enhanced pipeline built on RadGraph-XL and SapBERT. These\nentities are linked to UMLS concepts (CUIs), enabling a transparent,\ninterpretable set-based representation of each report. We then define a\ntask-adaptive similarity measure based on a modified and weighted version of\nthe Tversky Index that accounts for synonymy, negation, and hierarchical\nrelationships between medical entities. This allows efficient and semantically\nmeaningful similarity comparisons between reports. We demonstrate that our\napproach outperforms state-of-the-art embedding-based retrieval methods in a\nradiograph classification task on MIMIC-CXR, particularly in long-tail\nsettings. Additionally, we use our pipeline to generate ontology-backed disease\nlabels for MIMIC-CXR, offering a valuable new resource for downstream learning\ntasks.

This work\nquantifies how varying levels of user coordination and information availability\nthrough such apps impact search time and the probability of finding street\nparking. Through a data-driven simulation of Madrid's street parking ecosystem,\nwe analyze four distinct strategies: uncoordinated search (Unc-Agn),\ncoordinated parking without awareness of non-users (Cord-Agn), an idealized\noracle system that knows the positions of all non-users (Cord-Oracle), and our\nnovel/practical Cord-Approx strategy that estimates non-users' behavior\nprobabilistically. The Cord-Approx strategy, instead of requiring knowledge of\nhow close non-users are to a certain spot in order to decide whether to\nnavigate toward it, uses past occupancy distributions to elongate physical\ndistances between system users and alternative parking spots, and then solves a\nHungarian matching problem to dispatch accordingly. In high-fidelity\nsimulations of Madrid's parking network with real traffic data, users of\nCord-Approx averaged 6.69 minutes to find parking, compared to 19.98 minutes\nfor non-users without an app. A zone-level snapshot shows that Cord-Approx\nreduces search time for system users by 72% (range = 67-76%) in central hubs,\nand up to 73% in residential areas, relative to non-users.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u624b\u673a\u5e94\u7528\u5728\u6539\u5584\u57ce\u5e02\u8857\u8fb9\u505c\u8f66\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0cCord-Approx\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u77ed\u4e86\u641c\u7d22\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f13\u89e3\u57ce\u5e02\u4ea4\u901a\u62e5\u5835\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u505c\u8f66\u6548\u7387\u662f\u4e9f\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u505c\u8f66\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u975e\u534f\u8c03\u3001\u534f\u8c03\u3001\u7406\u60f3oracle\u53ca\u65b0\u9896\u7684Cord-Approx\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "Cord-Approx\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u505c\u8f66\u641c\u7d22\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece19.98\u5206\u949f\u964d\u81f36.69\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u5728\u6838\u5fc3\u533a\u57df\u548c\u4f4f\u5b85\u533a\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u8fbe72%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684Cord-Approx\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u505c\u8f66\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u7f13\u89e3\u57ce\u5e02\u4ea4\u901a\u538b\u529b\u3002"}}

Compared to other approaches to\nfairness, FairLoop enables context-aware bias removal through human\ninvolvement, addressing the influence of sensitive attributes selectively\nrather than excluding them uniformly.", "AI": {"tldr": "FairLoop\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u6307\u5bfc\u5b9e\u73b0\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u5ba1\u67e5\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u51b3\u7b56\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u7279\u5f81\u5982\u6027\u522b\u6216\u5e74\u9f84\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\uff0c\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u5ba1\u67e5\u540e\u8c03\u6574\u51b3\u7b56\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u4ee5\u5fae\u8c03\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "result": "FairLoop\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u79fb\u9664\uff0c\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FairLoop\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u5176\u9488\u5bf9\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

This paper\nanalyzes FDS's properties, showing that minimizing the size of its search tree\nguided by ranked branching decisions is closely related to the Multi-armed\nbandit (MAB) problem. Building on this insight, MAB reinforcement learning\nalgorithms are applied to FDS, extended with problem-specific refinements and\nparameter tuning, and evaluated on the two most fundamental scheduling\nproblems, the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) and Resource-Constrained\nProject Scheduling Problem (RCPSP). The resulting enhanced FDS, using the best\nextended MAB algorithm and configuration, performs 1.7 times faster on the JSSP\nand 2.1 times faster on the RCPSP benchmarks compared to the original\nimplementation in a new solver called OptalCP, while also being 3.5 times\nfaster on the JSSP and 2.1 times faster on the RCPSP benchmarks than the\ncurrent state-of-the-art FDS algorithm in IBM CP Optimizer 22.1.
