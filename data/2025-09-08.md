### [1] [Communication-Efficient Collaborative LLM Inference via Distributed Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04576)
*Ce Zheng,Tingting Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Speculative decoding is an emerging technique that accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by allowing a smaller draft model to predict multiple tokens in advance, which are then verified or corrected by a larger target model. In AI-native radio access networks (AI-RAN), this paradigm is well-suited for collaborative inference between resource-constrained end devices and more capable edge servers or base stations (BSs). However, existing distributed speculative decoding requires transmitting the full vocabulary probability distribution from the draft model on the device to the target model at the BS, which leads to prohibitive uplink communication overhead. To address this issue, we propose a ``Top-K Sparse Logits Transmission (TK-SLT)`` scheme, where the draft model transmits only the top-K token raw probabilities and the corresponding token indices instead of the entire distribution. This approach significantly reduces bandwidth consumption while maintaining inference performance. We further derive an analytical expression for the optimal draft length that maximizes inference throughput, and provide a theoretical analysis of the achievable speedup ratio under TK-SLT. Experimental results validate both the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Michael Shifrin,Joseph Tabrikian,Igal Bilik*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于近场雷达模型的方法，用于在汽车雷达系统中估计目标的切向速度，解决了传统远场模型无法估计切向速度的局限性，并通过仿真验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统汽车雷达系统基于远场模型，无法估计目标切向速度，而切向速度是精确感知动态环境的关键参数。因此，需要新的方法来解决此问题。

Method: 本文提出近场雷达模型，并利用目标在距离、速度和多普勒上的迁移信息进行切向速度估计。通过Cram'er-Rao界和模糊函数进行可辨识性分析，并设计了一种计算高效的最大似然估计算法，利用目标迁移信息进行切向速度估计，同时减轻了似然函数在距离、速度和多普勒上的模糊效应。此外，研究还启发了分离阵列配置的使用。

Result: 仿真结果验证了所提出方法的理论可行性，并在单目标和多目标场景下评估了算法性能。所提出的方法在切向速度估计方面取得了显著的精度和可靠性提升，并能同时改善距离、速度和多普勒估计的模糊效应。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于近场雷达模型和目标迁移信息的方法，能够有效估计汽车雷达系统的切向速度，提高了雷达系统的精度和可靠性，从而增强了高级驾驶辅助系统和自动驾驶汽车的态势感知能力。

Abstract: This work investigates the problem of tangential velocity estimation in
automotive radar systems, addressing the limitations of conventionally
considered models. Conventional automotive radars are usually based on
far-field models and estimate the target's range, radial velocity, and
direction-of-arrival (DOA) but are not able to estimate the tangential
component of the target 2-D velocity, which is a critical parameter for
reliable perception of dynamic environments. To address this challenge, we
introduce the near-field radar model, which considers various migration
elements in range, radial velocity, and Doppler along time and space.
Conventionally, these migration effects result in smearing of the likelihood
function for estimating the target parameters. However, if the model is
correctly specified, these migration effects are informative for tangential
velocity estimation. We conduct an identifiability analysis for tangential
velocity estimation using the Cram\'er-Rao bound and ambiguity function. The
insights from this study motivate the use of a separated array configuration
and the development of a computationally efficient maximum likelihood based
algorithm designed to utilize target migrations for tangential velocity
estimation, while maintaining practical computational complexity. In addition
to tangential velocity estimation, the proposed algorithm mitigates likelihood
smearing in range, radial velocity, and Doppler. Simulations validate the
theoretical feasibility study, and evaluate the algorithms' performance in both
single- and multi-target scenarios. The proposed approach improves the accuracy
and reliability of automotive radars, enhancing situational awareness for
advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles.

### [3] [Environment-Aware IRS Deployment via Channel Knowledge Map: Joint Sensing-Communications Coverage Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04768)
*Yilong Chen,Zixiang Ren,Jie Xu,Rui Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本论文研究了IRS赋能的ISAC系统中IRS的部署优化问题，旨在最小化系统成本，同时满足感应和通信需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究IRS在IRS赋能的综合传感和通信（ISAC）系统中部署优化的潜在问题，以增强基站（BS）的传感和通信覆盖范围。

Method: 提出了一种利用信道知识图（CKM）的环境感知IRS部署设计，并将其与BS的发射波束成形和IRS的反射波束成形相结合，以解决混合整数非凸优化问题。采用基于连续凸近似（SCA）的松弛和边界方法来求解。

Result: 通过数值结果证明了所提出的算法在降低系统成本以及满足感应和通信要求方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的IRS部署优化方法，结合了CKM和SCA技术，能够有效地解决IRS赋能的ISAC系统的成本和性能问题。

Abstract: This paper studies the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) deployment
optimization problem for IRS-enabled integrated sensing and communications
(ISAC) systems, in which multiple IRSs are strategically deployed at candidate
locations to assist a base station (BS) to enhance the coverage of both sensing
and communications. We present an environment-aware IRS deployment design via
exploiting the channel knowledge map (CKM), which provides the channel state
information (CSI) between each candidate IRS location and BS or targeted
sensing/communication points. Based on the obtained CSI from CKM, we optimize
the deployment of IRSs, jointly with the BS's transmit beamforming and IRSs'
reflective beamforming during operation, with the objective of minimizing the
system cost, while guaranteeing the minimum illumination power requirements at
sensing areas and the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements at
communication areas. In particular, we consider two cases when the IRSs'
reflective beamforming optimization can be implemented dynamically in real time
and quasi-stationarily over the whole operation period, respectively. For both
cases, the joint IRS deployment and transmit/reflective beamforming designs are
formulated as mixed-integer non-convex optimization problems, which are solved
via the successive convex approximation (SCA)-based relax-and-bound method.
Specifically, we first relax the binary IRS deployment indicators into
continuous variables, then find converged solutions via SCA, and finally round
relaxed indicators back to binary values. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed algorithms in reducing the system cost while
meeting the sensing and communication requirements.

### [4] [SREC: Encrypted Semantic Super-Resolution Enhanced Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04787)
*Zhidi Zhang,Rui Meng,Song Gao,Haixiao Gao,Xiaodong Xu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SREC的加密语义超分辨率增强通信方法，以解决现有语义通信中语义特征易被窃听的安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义通信（SemCom）虽然提高了通信效率，但其传输的语义特征以明文形式存在，容易被窃听，存在安全隐患。

Method: SREC方法采用模256加密方法对语义特征进行加密，并利用超分辨率重建技术来提高图像的重建质量。

Result: 仿真结果表明，在加性高斯白噪声（AWGN）信道中，使用不同调制方法时，SREC在保证安全性的同时，在低信噪比（SNR）条件下能获得更好的传输性能。

Conclusion: SREC方法能够有效解决语义通信中的安全问题，并在低信噪比下实现优于传统方法的传输性能。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom), as a typical paradigm of deep integration
between artificial intelligence (AI) and communication technology,
significantly improves communication efficiency and resource utilization
efficiency. However, the security issues of SemCom are becoming increasingly
prominent. Semantic features transmitted in plaintext over physical channels
are easily intercepted by eavesdroppers. To address this issue, this paper
proposes Encrypted Semantic Super-Resolution Enhanced Communication (SREC) to
secure SemCom. SREC uses the modulo-256 encryption method to encrypt semantic
features, and employs super-resolution reconstruction method to improve the
reconstruction quality of images. The simulation results show that in the
additive Gaussian white noise (AWGN) channel, when different modulation methods
are used, SREC can not only stably guarantee security, but also achieve better
transmission performance under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.

### [5] [KGRAG-SC: Knowledge Graph RAG-Assisted Semantic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04801)
*Dayu Fan,Rui Meng,Song Gao,Xiaodong Xu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: KGRAG-SC是一个知识图谱辅助的语义通信框架，通过提取关键语义信息和使用自适应传输策略，在低信噪比下提高了通信性能并降低了传输开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端深度学习语义通信方案可解释性差，在噪声条件下语义选择和重建能力不足。

Method: KGRAG-SC利用多维知识图谱，通过社区引导的实体链接和GraphRAG进行语义提取。发送端构建最小连通子图并传输紧凑的实体索引。采用基于结构中心性度量的自适应传输策略，对关键语义元素提供不等错误保护。接收端利用大语言模型和共享知识图谱进行知识驱动的文本重建。

Result: KGRAG-SC在低信噪比条件下实现了优于传统方法的语义保真度，并显著降低了传输开销。

Conclusion: 将结构化知识表示与生成式语言模型相结合的语义通信方法是有效的。

Abstract: The state-of-the-art semantic communication (SC) schemes typically rely on
end-to-end deep learning frameworks that lack interpretability and struggle
with robust semantic selection and reconstruction under noisy conditions. To
address this issue, this paper presents KGRAG-SC, a knowledge graph-assisted SC
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation principles. KGRAG-SC
employs a multi-dimensional knowledge graph, enabling efficient semantic
extraction through community-guided entity linking and GraphRAG-assisted
processing. The transmitter constructs minimal connected subgraphs that capture
essential semantic relationships and transmits only compact entity indices
rather than full text or semantic triples. An importance-aware adaptive
transmission strategy provides unequal error protection based on structural
centrality metrics, prioritizing critical semantic elements under adverse
channel conditions. At the receiver, large language models perform
knowledge-driven text reconstruction using the shared knowledge graph as
structured context, ensuring robust semantic recovery even with partial
information loss. Experimental results demonstrate that KGRAG-SC achieves
superior semantic fidelity in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions while
significantly reducing transmission overhead compared to traditional
communication methods, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating structured
knowledge representation with generative language models for SC systems.

### [6] [SemSteDiff: Generative Diffusion Model-based Coverless Semantic Steganography Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04803)
*Song Gao,Rui Meng,Xiaodong Xu,Haixiao Gao,Yiming Liu,Chenyuan Feng,Ping Zhang,Tony Q. S. Quek,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于生成扩散模型的无封面语义隐写通信（SemSteDiff）方案，用于将秘密图像隐藏到生成的封面图像中，解决了现有方案依赖预选封面图像的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的通信系统面临窃听威胁，即使是语义通信（SemCom）也不例外。为了解决这个问题，研究了语义隐写通信（SemSteCom）方案来混淆语义窃听者。然而，现有的基于图像传输的SemSteCom方案依赖于预先选择的封面图像，这限制了其通用性。

Method: 提出一种基于生成扩散模型（Generative Diffusion Model）的无封面语义隐写通信（SemSteDiff）方案。该方案利用语义相关的公私钥对，使合法接收者能够正确解码秘密图像，而没有完整密钥对的窃听者则无法获取。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方案在不同的联合信源信道编码（JSCC）框架中具有即插即用（plug-and-play）的有效性。在不同的窃听者威胁下的比较结果显示，当信噪比（SNR）为0 dB时，合法接收者的峰值信噪比（PSNR）比窃听者高4.14 dB。

Conclusion: 所提出的SemSteDiff方案能够有效地将秘密图像隐藏到生成的图像中，解决了现有方案的局限性，并能在不同的通信框架下提供安全性，优于窃听者。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom), as a novel paradigm for future communication
systems, has recently attracted much attention due to its superiority in
communication efficiency. However, similar to traditional communication, it
also suffers from eavesdropping threats. Intelligent eavesdroppers could launch
advanced semantic analysis techniques to infer secret semantic information.
Therefore, some researchers have designed Semantic Steganography Communication
(SemSteCom) scheme to confuse semantic eavesdroppers. However, the
state-of-the-art SemSteCom schemes for image transmission rely on the
pre-selected cover image, which limits the universality. To address this issue,
we propose a Generative Diffusion Model-based Coverless Semantic Steganography
Communication (SemSteDiff) scheme to hide secret images into generated stego
images. The semantic related private and public keys enable legitimate receiver
to decode secret images correctly while the eavesdropper without completely
true key-pairs fail to obtain them. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the plug-and-play design in different Joint Source-Channel
Coding (JSCC) frameworks. The comparison results under different eavesdroppers'
threats show that, when Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) = 0 dB, the peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the legitimate receiver is 4.14 dB higher than
that of the eavesdropper.

### [7] [AI-Driven Fronthaul Link Compression in Wireless Communication Systems: Review and Method Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04805)
*Keqin Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: AI驱动的无线通信系统中的新型 fronthaul 压缩技术，以应对带宽和延迟限制，并提出了针对蜂窝式架构的定制化解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 fronthaul 压缩方法在严格的带宽和延迟限制下存在局限性，例如依赖于严格的先验知识、在高压缩比下性能急剧下降以及难以跨信道和部署进行调整。

Method: 本文首先回顾了人工智能（AI）驱动的压缩技术，然后重点分析了两种高压缩方案：一种是基于端到端学习的信道状态信息（CSI）反馈，另一种是基于资源块（RB）粒度的预编码优化与压缩相结合。在此基础上，提出了一种针对蜂窝式架构的 fronthaul 压缩策略。

Result: 所提出的 fronthaul 压缩策略能够实现高压缩率，同时控制性能损失，支持 RB 级别的速率自适应，并实现低延迟推理，适用于下一代网络的集中式协作传输。

Conclusion: AI 技术为 fronthaul 压缩提供了更优的解决方案，能够有效应对现代无线通信系统的挑战，并为下一代网络架构提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Modern fronthaul links in wireless systems must transport high-dimensional
signals under stringent bandwidth and latency constraints, which makes
compression indispensable. Traditional strategies such as compressed sensing,
scalar quantization, and fixed-codec pipelines often rely on restrictive
priors, degrade sharply at high compression ratios, and are hard to tune across
channels and deployments. Recent progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has
brought end-to-end learned transforms, vector and hierarchical quantization,
and learned entropy models that better exploit the structure of Channel State
Information(CSI), precoding matrices, I/Q samples, and LLRs. This paper first
surveys AI-driven compression techniques and then provides a focused analysis
of two representative high-compression routes: CSI feedback with end-to-end
learning and Resource Block (RB) granularity precoding optimization combined
with compression. Building on these insights, we propose a fronthaul
compression strategy tailored to cell-free architectures. The design targets
high compression with controlled performance loss, supports RB-level rate
adaptation, and enables low-latency inference suitable for centralized
cooperative transmission in next-generation networks.

Motivation: 现有电磁成像方法在处理反问题时存在非线性、病态性、难以整合先验知识、缺乏理论保证等问题，导致在可解释性、失真误差和可靠性之间难以平衡。

Method: 1. 训练一个潜在扩散模型（LDM）来学习目标（介电常数和电导率图）的先验分布，该模型在无标签数据集上训练。 2. 将学习到的先验知识整合到基于生成模型即插即用（PnP）后验采样框架中。 3. 通过交替使用强制似然分布和先验分布的采样器来进行后验采样。 4. 基于采样结果，通过最小均方误差（MMSE）估计获得可靠重建。

Result: 在脑成像实验中，该方法在重建精度和结构相似性方面达到了最先进的性能，同时保持了高测量保真度。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于潜在扩散的后验采样方法能够有效地将先验知识集成到基于物理的反演中，克服了现有方法的局限性，并在量化电磁脑成像中实现了高精度的重建。

Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) imaging is an important tool for non-invasive sensing
with low-cost and portable devices. One emerging application is EM stroke
imaging, which enables early diagnosis and continuous monitoring of brain
strokes. Quantitative imaging is achieved by solving an inverse scattering
problem (ISP) that reconstructs permittivity and conductivity maps from
measurements. In general, the reconstruction accuracy is limited by its
inherent nonlinearity and ill-posedness. Existing methods, including
learning-free and learning-based approaches, fail to either incorporate
complicated prior distributions or provide theoretical guarantees, posing
difficulties in balancing interpretability, distortion error, and reliability.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a posterior sampling method based on
latent diffusion for quantitative EM brain imaging, adapted from a generative
plug-and-play (PnP) posterior sampling framework. Our approach allows to
flexibly integrate prior knowledge into physics-based inversion without
requiring paired measurement-label datasets. We first learn the prior
distribution of targets from an unlabeled dataset, and then incorporate the
learned prior into posterior sampling. In particular, we train a latent
diffusion model on permittivity and conductivity maps to capture their prior
distribution. Then, given measurements and the forward model describing EM wave
physics, we perform posterior sampling by alternating between two samplers that
respectively enforce the likelihood and prior distributions. Finally, reliable
reconstruction is obtained through minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation
based on the samples. Experimental results on brain imaging demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction accuracy
and structural similarity while maintaining high measurement fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用可旋转天线（RA）通过利用天线旋转提供的新空间自由度（DoF）来改善混合近场和远场通信系统中的通信性能，以减轻复杂的近场干扰和混合场干扰。

Method: 研究了一个模块化的RA启用混合场下行通信系统，其中一个由多个RA子阵组成的基站（BS）在存在几个遗留远场用户的情况下与多个近场用户通信。通过联合优化BS处所有子阵的功率分配和旋转角度，制定了一个最大化近场用户总速率的优化问题。分析了所有子阵共享相同旋转角度的特例，并使用菲涅尔积分获得旋转感知归一化近场干扰和旋转感知归一化混合场干扰的闭式表达式。提出了一种高效的双层算法来获得高质量的解，其中内层使用连续凸近似（SCA）技术优化功率分配，外层通过粒子群优化（PSO）确定所有子阵的旋转角度。

Result: 研究结果表明，天线旋转有效地抑制了近场干扰和混合场干扰，从而显著提高了混合场通信性能。RA相比于传统的固定天线系统实现了显著的性能提升，并且所开发的联合设计相比于基准方案更有效。

Conclusion: 可旋转天线（RA）能够通过提供新的空间自由度来显著改善混合近场和远场通信系统的性能，有效抑制近场和混合场干扰。所提出的联合优化设计方法能够有效地提升系统性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose to leverage rotatable antennas (RAs) for improving
the communication performance in mixed near-field and far-field communication
systems by exploiting a new spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) offered by antenna
rotation to mitigate complex near-field interference and mixed-field
interference. Specifically, we investigate a modular RA-enabled mixed-field
downlink communication system, where a base station (BS) consisting of multiple
RA subarrays communicates with multiple near-field users in the presence of
several legacy far-field users. We formulate an optimization problem to
maximize the sum-rate of the near-field users by jointly optimizing the power
allocation and rotation angles of all subarrays at the BS. To gain useful
insights into the effect of RAs on mixed-field communications, we first analyze
a special case where all subarrays share the same rotation angle and obtain
closed-form expressions for the rotation-aware normalized near-field
interference and the rotation-aware normalized mixed-field interference using
the Fresnel integrals. We then analytically reveal that array rotation
effectively suppresses both interference types, thereby significantly enhancing
mixed-field communication performance. For the general case involving
subarray-wise rotation, we propose an efficient double-layer algorithm to
obtain a high-quality solution, where the inner layer optimizes power
allocation using the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, while the
outer layer determines the rotation angles of all subarrays via particle swarm
optimization (PSO). Finally, numerical results highlight the significant
performance gains achieved by RAs over conventional fixed-antenna systems and
demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed joint design compared to
benchmark schemes.

*Yue Geng,Tee Hiang Cheng,Kai Zhong,Kah Chan Teh,Qingqing Wu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了可移动智能反射面（MIRS）辅助的集成传感与通信（ISAC）系统，旨在通过联合优化MIRS位置、反射系数、波束赋形和接收滤波器来最小化系统功耗，并提出了两种MIRS方案（点式控制和阵列式控制）和一种基于乘积黎曼流形优化的方法（PRMO）来解决优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高IRS在ISAC系统中的适应性和性能，引入了可移动IRS（MIRS）技术，允许灵活调整IRS单元位置，从而满足传感和通信的服务质量（QoS）要求。

Method: 提出两种MIRS方案：点式控制和阵列式控制。利用乘积黎曼流形优化（PRMO）方法，通过基于惩罚的变换和黎曼Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno（RBFGS）算法，在构造的乘积黎曼流形空间（PRMS）上并行更新变量，以解决联合波束赋形和位置优化问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，MIRS在功耗最小化方面优于传统IRS。点式控制方案实现了最低功耗，而阵列式控制方案在次优解和计算效率之间取得了平衡。

Conclusion: MIRS技术能够有效提升IRS在ISAC系统中的性能，通过优化MIRS的单元位置和系统参数，可以显著降低系统功耗。点式控制和阵列式控制方案各有优劣，可根据具体需求选择。

Abstract: Driven by intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA)
technologies, movable IRS (MIRS) has been proposed to improve the adaptability
and performance of conventional IRS, enabling flexible adjustment of the IRS
reflecting element positions. This paper investigates MIRS-aided integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The objective is to minimize the
power required for satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) of sensing and
communication by jointly optimizing the MIRS element positions, IRS reflection
coefficients, transmit beamforming, and receive filters. To balance the
performance-cost trade-off, we proposed two MIRS schemes: element-wise control
and array-wise control, where the positions of individual reflecting elements
and arrays consisting of multiple elements are controllable, respectively. To
address the joint beamforming and position optimization, a product Riemannian
manifold optimization (PRMO) method is proposed, where the variables are
updated over a constructed product Riemannian manifold space (PRMS) in parallel
via penalty-based transformation and Riemannian
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (RBFGS) algorithm. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed MIRS outperforms conventional IRS in power
minimization with both element-wise control and array-wise control.
Specifically, with different system parameters, the minimum power is achieved
by the MIRS with the element-wise control scheme, while suboptimal solution and
higher computational efficiency are achieved by the MIRS with array-wise
control scheme.

Conclusion: 本文介绍了一种新的 PMF 估计算法框架，这是系列文章的第一部分，后续文章将研究该模型的唯一性。

Abstract: In this article, a Probability Mass Function (PMF) estimation method which
tames the curse of dimensionality is proposed. This method, called Partial
Coupled Tensor Factorization of 3D marginals or PCTF3D, has for principle to
partially couple order-3 data projections -- seen as order-3 tensors -- to
obtain a tensor decomposition of the probability mass tensor. The novelty of
PCTF3D relies on partial coupling which consists in choosing a subset of 3D
marginals. The choice of marginals is then formulated with hypergraphs. After
presenting possible coupling strategies, some numerical experiments and an
application of the method are proposed. This article is the first of a two-part
article. While this first article focuses on a new algorithmic framework for
PMF estimation, the second studies uniqueness properties of the model
introduced in this article.

Conclusion: PCTF3D方法的唯一性性质取决于所采用的耦合策略，并提出了一种笛卡尔耦合，以提高可识别性界限。

Abstract: In this paper, uniqueness properties of a coupled tensor model are studied.
This new coupled tensor model is used in a new method called Partial Coupled
Tensor Factorization of 3D marginals or PCTF3D. This method performs estimation
of probability mass functions by coupling 3D marginals, seen as order-3
tensors. The core novelty of PCTF3D's approach (detailed in the part I article)
relies on the partial coupling which consists on the choice of 3D marginals to
be coupled. Tensor methods are ubiquitous in many applications of statistical
learning, with their biggest advantage of having strong uniqueness properties.
In this paper, the uniqueness properties of PCTF3D's constrained coupled
low-rank model is assessed. While probabilistic constraints of the coupled
model are handled properly, it is shown that uniqueness highly depends on the
coupling used in PCTF3D. After proposing a Jacobian algorithm providing maximum
recoverable rank, different coupling strategies presented in the Part I article
are examined with respect to their uniqueness properties. Finally, an
identifiability bound is given for a so-called Cartesian coupling which permits
enhancing sufficient bounds of the literature.

Abstract: Accurate phase estimation -- the process of assigning phase values between
$0$ and $2\pi$ to repetitive or periodic signals -- is a cornerstone in the
analysis of oscillatory signals across diverse fields, from neuroscience to
robotics, where it is fundamental, e.g., to understanding coordination in
neural networks, cardiorespiratory coupling, and human-robot interaction.
However, existing methods are often limited to offline processing and/or
constrained to one-dimensional signals. In this paper, we introduce ROPE,
which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first phase-estimation algorithm
capable of (i) handling signals of arbitrary dimension and (ii) operating in
real-time, with minimal error. ROPE identifies repetitions within the signal to
segment it into (pseudo-)periods and assigns phase values by performing
efficient, tractable searches over previous signal segments. We extensively
validate the algorithm on a variety of signal types, including trajectories
from chaotic dynamical systems, human motion-capture data, and
electrocardiographic recordings. Our results demonstrate that ROPE is robust
against noise and signal drift, and achieves significantly superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art phase estimation methods. This advancement enables
real-time analysis of complex biological rhythms, opening new pathways, for
example, for early diagnosis of pathological rhythm disruptions and developing
rhythm-based therapeutic interventions in neurological and cardiovascular
disorders.
